WHO'S THE 
STRONGEST? - 


VALERY SUSLOV 


(MISION GE, 


Moscow 


Alec was always asking Anton questions. 

“How high is the sky?” 

“What's deeper, Ше sea or the ocean?” 

“Can you dig a hole in the Earth and come out on the other 
side?” 
. Today, too, he was skipping along, trying to keep up with 
Anton saying, “Who's stronger, an elephant or a whale? And 
who's the strongest of all?”

Anton was in a hurry. He was 
| grown-up and had many things to 
I. do. But Alec kept right on. 

Жы “Tell me who's the strongest?” 

“See that crane over there?” 

Anton said. “It's lifting a railway 

Б coach. That means it сап lift an 

+ elephant or a whale as easily as a 
feather.” 


This was something Alec had never thought of. He was 
silent for a few moments and then asked, “But what's stronger 
than a crane, Anton?” 


“See that blue electric locomotive pulling fifty freight cars? 
All of them are loaded to the very top. That means the 
locomotive is much stronger than the crane, doesn't ії?" 

“Yes,” Alec replied slowly. “Then what's stronger than 
an electric locomotive?” 

“Look over there,” Anton said, picking Alec up and 
standing him on the embankment railing. “See that ship being 
loaded? ІСІ take lumber, bales, barrels and crates far across 
the sea. Its hold is so big it can take on twenty-five trains. 
Perhaps even thirty. It will carry them all across the sea.” 


That was something to think 
about. Alec even stopped skip- 
ping. “Anton, but whats the 
strongest of them all?. THE 
VERY STRONGEST?” 

"Stop pestering me, Alec. Try 
to figure it out yourself." 

Alec thought and thought but 
couldn't decide. 


"Come on, tell me," he said at last. 
“Who makes the crane lift its long boom? Who makes it 
work?” 
“I know! The crane operator!”

“And who makes the electric 
locomotive move along the rails 
and pull fifty freight cars?” 

“The engineer.”

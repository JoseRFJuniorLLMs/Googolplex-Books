PUBLISHER'S FOREWORD 
To English-speaking chess devotees the name of Rashid Nezhmetdinov is not all 
that well known, whereas in eastern Europe and especially in the former USSR his 
name is synonymous with very deep combinations and fierce attacks. 
In part his lack of fame outside of the former Soviet bloc is due to his having 
never played in the West and having played in only a few international tourneys, 
with the exception of Bucharest 1954 rather minor ones. 
In addition, Nezhmetdinov often had rather inconsistent results, one day beating 
a world champion and the next day losing to a player in the bottom half of the 
tournament. Had he been concerned only with his tournament score, who knows 
how many top flight tournaments he might have won. But no, that was not 
Nezhmetdinov's style. He was a true seeker of truth on the chess board. Where 
others sought glory in point totals, he sought glory in the inherent beauty of the 
particular game he was playing. How else can one explain his sublime victory over 
Polugayevsky at Sochi in 1958? The subtlety and hidden power of his moves in 
that game betray the soul of a chess "magician". As with some of Alekhine's 
games, one senses an intuition beyond the realm of explanation. Even fast modem 
chess-playing programs have difficulty in finding the ultimate truth in such games. 
Mark Kac, the eminent mathematician, once wrote something to the effect that if 
one were to rank the leading physicists of modem times, a very talented colleague 
might say that with proper dedication and in his best moments he could see how he 
might be able to achieve some of their notable results. But in the case of some, 
such as Richard Feynman, one must simply admit that even after the demonstration 
of his idea, and after prolonged thought about it, he cannot fathom how Feynman 
could find his way through vast complexities to reach the result. Those who 
conceive of the methods to attain these results are simply "magicians". 
Nezhmetdinov was a chess magician. 
In chess, unlike nature, we at least know all the rules, and yet understanding how 
players such as Tal, Alekhine, and Nezhmetdinov can find their way though a maze 
of deeply complex positions still defies us, but sharpens our appetite for seeing 
such phenomenal games. 
While Nezhmetdinov was inconsistent, he still did accomplish enviable overall 
results. He was five times the champion of the RSFSR, and a five-time finalist in 
the Soviet Union championships, and was a prize winner in five international 
tournaments. 
But the greatest indication of his outstanding chess talent is his record against five 
world champions. Out of twenty games Nezhmetdinov won six, drew nine, and 
lost five. 
In a recent chess column Nigel Short speaks of the tyranny of ELO-ratings and 
says of Nezhmetdinov: " ... he thrice defeated Mikhail Tal (in four encounters) and 
would wipe the floor with many contemporary grandmasters." 
Nezhmetdinov was also very successful as a chess teacher and trainer. He was a 
consultant to Tal in his first match for the world title against Botvinnik and helped 
him greatly in achieving that victory. In 1962 Nezhmetdinov was awarded the title 
of Honored Trainer of the USSR. 
The publication of this book has a rather long and convoluted history. Although 
the translation has been in my hands for some twelve years, there were quite a few 
impediments in the way of quick publication. For one, the translation needed much

"Revisando e revisando devido à sua nature técnica do xadrez com termos especiais, frequentes erros tipográficos e ocasionais erros de fato no original texto russo da primeira edição do livro. Neste trabalho, Jack O'Keefe, com seu conhecimento de ambos o russo e o inglês e sua habilidade extraordinária em clarificar o inglês, fez uma excelente contribuição. Sem seus esforços, não vejo como eu poderia ter chegado a um resultado tão próximo. Ambos Jack O'Keefe e Richard Cantwell examinaram a análise críticamente e deram muitas melhorias e sugestões valiosas. Estou eternamente em dívida com eles por sua habilidade e perseverança. Qualquer erro ou falha restante é minha própria. Eu sempre estou ansioso para melhorar e aceitar sugestões de leitores. 

Nós fizemos algumas revisões significativas. Dois novos jogos e um novo final foram adicionados, e alguma análise de abertura antiga foi excluída. A lista de torneios e resultados de Nezhmetdinov foi corrigida e estendida, mas não inclui eventos de equipe em que ele jogou para o RSFSR ou o Clube Esportivo Spartak. 
Um livro de tamanho maior com uma versão completa de todos os jogos anotados de Nezhmetdinov será publicado pela Edições Caissa logo em seguida. O equilíbrio dos jogos não anotados no texto será dado sem notas. 
Em todo o caminho para finalmente publicar este livro, foi um longo e difícil processo para todos nós, mas estou muito orgulhoso de ser capaz de trazer os jogos de Nezhmetdinov para o mundo falante de inglês. Eu acredito que aqueles que joguem sobre esses jogos terão um sentido maior do único arte da beleza do xadrez a seu melhor.

MY EARLIEST GAMES 
(1929-1936) 
In September of 1923, on the stairs of the Second Palace of Soviets on Lenin St. 
in Kazan, I accidentally found a piece of paper with unintelligible figures and 
signs on it while I was in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek. I quickly picked 
it up and put it in my pocket. (They were already looking for me and I needed to 
find a place to hide.) 
That evening at home I remembered the mysterious paper. I did not know 
Russian well at that time and worked out its contents with difficulty. It turned 
out to be the chess column of the magazine Smena. In it, the rules of play and the 
moves of the pieces were explained. That was the "theory", but what about 
practice? 
A few days later, I arrived quite early for a meeting of the first Pioneer group 
of the Communist Club. I went into the reading room to look at the pictures on 
the wall and (if I was successful) the magazines on the tables. 
Here I noticed a group of adults bending over the tables. On the tables were the 
same "things" (as I called the pieces then) as on the piece of paper that I had 
carefully kept, and which I went over and studied almost every night. 
Going up carefully to the "uncles", I stood quietly to observe what they were 
doing. I rejoiced when I discovered that they moved the "things" exactly as was 
explained on my piece of paper. 
But I rejoiced even more when one of the "uncles" answered my shy question, 
"May I playa game with you?" with a smile: "Yes, you may." Great was the 
astonishment of the grownups when I won all my games with them (they were, of 
course, beginners). 
That evening I went home filled with joy. Now I had another important piece 
of paper. It was a note from Samsonov, the director of the club (who had 
arrived toward the end of play), to the City chess club: " He shows promise; 
please admit him to the club." 
"He shows promise"- I was proud of that description. But at the club they 
quickly put me in my place. There, they all won from me right up to 1927. 
With no notion of theory and, on top of that, too interested in "blitz" chess, I 
was slow to make progress. 
The turning point came in 1927. After a break of almost a year (when I took a 
complete vacation from chess), I achieved a Category III ranking, skipping over 
Category IV. That winter in the first city Pioneer championship I finished first, 
winning all 15 of my games. 
But suddenly my aptitude for checkers also revealed itself. After learning the 
rules of that game in January of 1928, I took second place in the Kazan 
championship in February. In July I became the RARO champion (Region of 
Autonomous Republics and Oblasts), and in October I achieved Category I rank 
at the RSFSR championship in Moscow. 
Chess also started to "soften up" a bit. I finished first in a minor tournament 
in the spring of 1929, finished first in the semifinals in the winter, and finally 
won the title of champion of Kazan in May of 1930. 
In checkers, to be sure, improvement came more quickly. By 193] I was close 
to master strength.

The formation of my chess style took place from 1930 to 1936. I still paid little 
attention to theory, but sometimes played over games from the books of 
Alekhine and Capablanca. 
An important influence on my game was my contact with the leading players of 
Odessa in 1931-1933, when I lived and worked there. 
By the time I returned to Kazan in 1933, I had already learned to win regularly 
against average Category I players. 
In 1934-1935 I was mainly occupied by the study of checkers. Only in 
November and December of 1936 at Rostov-on-Don did I "cross swords" for the 
first time with the strongest first category chessplayers: Ufimtsev, Dubinin, 
Kopayev, Grechkin, Bastrikov, and others. They gave me a good trouncing. My 
ignorance of elementary theoretical principles told on me. It was necessary to 
undertake a serious study of chess. 
Games 1-5 below were played between 1929 and 1936. 
1. White: Samsonov 
Kazan 1929 
Vienna Game 
1. e2-e4 
e7-es 
2. Nbl-c3 
The Vienna Game. In this opening, 
White tries to open the f-file by f2-f4 
in order to develop an attack on the 
black King (at f7). 
In case of an 
exchange on f4, besides the open file 
White gets pawn superiority in the 
center (d- and e-pawns vs. ad-pawn). 
In several variations White intends to 
storm the castled King by f2-f4-f5 
and g2-g4-g5. Black in tum tries to 
hinder White's flank attack by a 
counter-thrust in the center (d6-d5). 
2. ... 
NgS-f6 
One of the best responses, preparing 
the advance d7-d5. Also possible is 
2 .... Bc5, in order to take control of 
the center square d4 and the diagonal 
a7-gl. 
3. f2-f4 
The brilliant Russian player 
Alekhine preferred the continuation 
3. Bc4 followed by d3 to prepare f2-
f4. 
However, by 3 .... Nxe4, Black 
gets sufficient counterplay. 
After 3 .... Nxe4 4. Qh5 Nd6 5. Bb3 
(if 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxe7+ Bxe7 7. 
Bb3 Nf5 and after c6 and d5 Black 
has a solid position) 5 .... Nc6 6. Nb5 
2 
g6 7. Qf3 f5 S. Qd5 Qe7 9. Nxc7+ 
KdS 1O.NxaS b6, the fight is very 
sharp. Black, in spite of his sizable 
loss of material has, apparently, the 
better chances since his attack is very 
dangerous. 
The following example shows how a 
player unfamiliar with opening 
variations gets into difficulties. In a 
1940 game against the Kazan 
Category I player Ingenol I fell into 
this line for the second time (the first 
was against Saigin in the 1939 Kazan 
championship, where I drew with 
difficulty). After long consideration, 
White found the following fantastic 
plan of mobilizing his forces: Qd5-
d3, Qd3-fl, Qfl-gl, h2-h4, Qgl-h2, 
0-0. White ultimately won this game, 
exploiting poor play by Black. 
But now I would on no account 
want to repeat 
this 
artificial 
maneuver. 
3 .... 
d7-ds 
A counter-thrust in the center is the 
best reply to a flank attack. 
4. f4xes 
Nf6xe4 
5. Ngl-f3 
5. Qf3 and 5. Qe2 are often played 
here. 
5. ... 
BfS-b4 
I played the opening without having 
any real idea of opening theory. 
Unfortunately, I learned the strength

of many theoretical variations by my 
own bitter experience .... 
As is generally known,S .... Be7 and 
5 .... Nc6 are good continuations. 
In the latter case, the interesting 
variation 6. Qe2 Bf5 7. Qb5 a6 S. 
Qxb7 (S. Qxd5 Nb4!) S .... Nb4 9. 
Nxe4 de 10. Nd4 RbS 11. Qa7 Bc5 
12. Qxc5 Qxd4! 13. Qxd4 Nxc2+ 14. 
Kf2 Nxd4 gives Black the advantage. 
6. Qdl-e2 
Stronger here is 6. Be2 with a good 
game for White. 
6. ... 
Bb4xc3 
7. b2xc3 
Bc8-g4?! 
Activity at all cost! This is the way 
I generally played at the beginning of 
my chess career. 
This move is the beginning of a 
combination by Black which, if 
White plays correctly, leads to a 
draw. Black should castle, to put his 
King in a safe position. 
Then a 
position with about equal chances 
would arise. 
8. Qe2-b5+ 
This inexact move gives Black 
tactical counterplay. Correct was S. 
Ba3!, and White gets significant 
chances for an attack on Black's King 
which is caught in the center. 
I will cite one possible variation: S . 
... Nc6 9. 0-0-0 Nxe5 10. Qb5+ c6 11. 
Nxe5! cb [Here the zwischenzug 11 . 
... Qc7! foils White's line: e.g., 12. 
Qb4 Bxdl 13. Bd3 0-0-0 14. Nxc6 
Qxc6 15. Rxdl KbS and Black 
remains the exchange ahead.-RSC] 
12. Bxb5+ Bd7 13. Bxd7+ Qxd7 14. 
Nxd7 Kxd7 15. Rhfl with a marked 
advantage for White in the endgame. 
8. ... 
c7-c6? 
S .... Nc6 is more active; then 9. 
Qxb7 is risky because of 9 .... O-O!, 
and if 10. Qxc6? Bxf3 11. gf 
[Instead White should play 11. h4! 
though after 11. ... Bg4 Black still has 
the better position-RSC] Qh4+ and 
White loses material. 
3 
In this case better is 9 Be2 Bxf3 10. 
Bxf3 (10. Qxb7? 0-0) 10 ... 0-0 with 
chances for both sides. 
9. Qb5xb7 
Bg4xf3 
10. Qb7xa8 
Instead of such a straightforward 
attempt to win material, White should 
make a deep appraisal of the specific 
features of the position. 
Then he 
would probably have found this 
promising sacrifice of the exchange: 
10. gf! Qh4+ 11. Kdl Nf2+ 12. Ke2 
Nxhl 13. QcS+ QdS (13 .... Ke7?? 
leads to mate after 14. Ba3+) 14. 
QxdS+ KxdS 15. Bg2. 
In this 
position, Black's small material 
advantage is outweighed by White's 
large positional advantage; a strong 
pawn center, two active bishops, and 
the lack of coordination of Black's 
pieces are grounds for evaluating this 
line in White's favor. 
10 .... 
Bf3xg2 
11. Bfl-e2? 
Suicide. 11. Bxg2 is correct and 
after 11. ... Qh4+ 
12. Ke2 (worse is 
12. Kdl since after 12 .... Qg4+ 13. 
Kel O-O! 14. Rgl Qh4+ 15. Kdl Qf2 
16. Rfl Qxg2 Black has a strong 
attack, for example: 17. Kel Qxh2 
IS. Ba3 Ng3 winning) 12 .... Qf2+ 
13. Kdl O-O! 14. Bxe4 de 15. ReI 
Black should force a draw by 
perpetual check (15 .... Qf3+ 16. Re2 
Qfl+ etc.). 
11. 
12. Kel-dl 
Qd8-h4+ 
Ne4-f2+

13. Kdl-el 
14. Kel-dl 
IS. Rhlxel 
Nf2-d3++ 
Qh4-el +! 
Nd3-f2 mate 
The first and only "smothered 
mate" in my career. It was only many 
years later that I noticed that the final 
attack in this game recalls the ending 
of a game by the famed Italian master 
Gioacchino Greco (1600-c.1634). 
2. White: Korchmar 
Categories I and II Tournament 
Odessa 1931 
Queen's Pawn Opening 
1. d2-d4 
2. Ngl-f3 
3. Bc1-gS 
4. e2-e3 
d7-d5 
NgS-f6 
e7-e6 
If White refrains from c2-c4 then 
he generally keeps the Queen bishop 
behind the pawn chain e3-d4-c3 (or 
develops it to b2 to control the 
squares d4 and e5). 
To this end, White aims for the 
following scheme of development: 
d4, e3,c3, Nf3, Bd3, Qe2, Nbd2, 0-0, 
e4, Nxe4, in order to attack Black's 
castled King position. 
Black, on the other hand, must keep 
in mind active counterplay in the 
center to hinder White in organizing 
his attack. 
4. 
S. Bfl-d3 
6. Nbl-d2 
BfS-e7 
0-0 
c7-c5 
4 
7. c2-c3 
S. Nf3-eS 
9. f2-f4 
b7-b6 
BcS-b7 
NbS-d7 
Treating the opening in an original 
way, White has obtained a position 
rich in attacking chances. However, 
with the following move, Korchmar 
begins an incorrect plan involving 
queenside castling. 
By exploiting 
White's queenside weaknesses, Black 
is the first to organize an attack. 
10. 0-0 is correct with a later 
transfer of the rook from f1 to h3 
for an attack by the pieces. 
10. Qdl-f3 
Nd7xe5 
11. f4xe5 
This allows the following dangerous 
attack by Black's knight. The right 
move is 11. de. 
11. 
12. BgSxe7 
13. 0-0-0 
Nf6-e4! 
QdSxe7 
13. Nxe4? does not work since after 
13 .... de White loses a piece (14. 
Bxe4 Qh4+). After 13. Bxe4 de 14. 
Qe2 (14. Nxe4? Qh4+) 14 .... cd, 
Black also has good prospects. All 
the same, this 
was 
the best 
continuation for White. 
13. ... 
f7-fS 
Before starting queens ide oper-
ations, Black firmly strengthens the 
position of his centralized knight and 
takes away any attacking possibilities 
by White. The tactical basis for this 
move lies in the fact that after 14. ef

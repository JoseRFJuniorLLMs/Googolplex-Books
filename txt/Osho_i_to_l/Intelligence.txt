ntelligence is intrinsic to life. Intelligence is a natural quality of life. 
Just as fire is hot and air is invisible and water flows downward, so is 
life intelligent. 
Intelligence is not an achievement. 
You are born intelligent. Trees are intelli-
gent in their o w n way, they have enough 
intelligence for their o w n life. Birds are in-
telligent, so are animals. In fact, w h a t reli-
gions mean by G o d is only this—that the 
universe is intelligent, that there is intelli-
gence hidden everywhere. A n d if you have 
eyes to see, you can see it everywhere. Life 
is intelligence. 
O n l y m a n has b e c o m e unintelligent. 
M a n has damaged the natural flow of 
life. Except in man, there is no unintelli-
gence. Have you ever seen a bird you can 
call stupid? Have you ever seen an animal 
you can call idiotic? N o , such things happen 
only to man. Something has gone wrong. 
Man's intelligence has been damaged, corrupted, has been crippled.

A n d meditation is nothing but the undoing of that damage. Medita-
tion will not be needed at all if m a n is left alone. If the priest and the 
politician do not interfere with man's intelligence, there will be no need 
for any meditation. Meditation is medicinal 
first you have to create the 
disease, then meditation is needed. If the disease is not there, meditation 
is not needed. A n d it is not accidental that the words medicine and medita-
tion come from the same root. It is medicinal. 
Each child is b o r n intelligent, and the m o m e n t the child is born, we 
pounce u p o n h i m and start destroying his intelligence, because intelli-
gence is dangerous to the political structure, to the social structure, to the 
religious structure. It is dangerous to the pope, it is dangerous to the priest, 
it is dangerous to the leader. It is dangerous to the status quo, the estab-
lishment. Intelligence is naturally rebellious. Intelligence cannot be forced 
into any servitude. Intelligence is very assertive, individual. Intelligence 
cannot be forced into a mechanical imitation. 
People have to be converted to carbon copies; their originality has to 
be destroyed, otherwise all the nonsense that has existed on the earth 
would be impossible. You need a leader because first you have been made 
unintelligent—otherwise there would be no need for any leader. W h y 
should you follow anybody? You will follow your intelligence. If some-
body wants to become a leader, then one thing has to be done: Your in-
telligence has to be destroyed somehow. You have to be shaken from your 
very roots, you have to be made afraid. You have to be made unconfident 
in yourself—that is a must. O n l y then can the leader come in. 
If you are intelligent, you will solve your problems yourself. Intelli-
gence is enough to solve all the problems. In fact, whatsoever problems 
are created in life, you have m o r e intelligence than those problems. It is a 
provision, it is a gift of nature. But there are ambitious people w h o want 
to rule, dominate; there are ambitious m a d m e n — t h e y create fear in you. 
Fear is like rust: It destroys all intelligence. If you want to destroy some-
body's intelligence, the first thing needed is to create fear: Create hell and 
make people afraid. W h e n people are afraid of hell, they will go and b o w 
d o w n to the priest. They will listen to the priest. If they don't listen to

I n t e l l i g e n c e - A 
G i f t 
o f 
N a t u r e 
the priest then they will face hellfire—naturally they are afraid. T h e y 
have to protect themselves from hellfire, and the priest is needed. T h e 
priest becomes a must. 
I 
have heard about two men w h o 
were partners in a business. Their business 
was very unique and they used to travel 
around the country. O n e partner would 
go into a town, and in the night he would 
go around and throw coal tar on people's 
windows, and then disappear by m o r n i n g . 
After two or three days, the other would 
come. He would offer to clean the coal tar 
from 
people's 
windows. 
And 
people 
would pay, of course—they had to pay. 
They were partners in the same business. 
O n e 
would do 
the 
damage, the 
other 
would come to u n d o it. 
Fear has to be created, and greed has to be created. Intelligence is not 
greedy. You will be surprised to k n o w that an intelligent m a n is never 
greedy. Greed is part of unintelligence. You hoard for t o m o r r o w because 
you are not confident that t o m o r r o w you will be able to tackle your life, 
otherwise w h y hoard? You become misers, you become greedy, because 
you don't k n o w whether t o m o r r o w your intelligence will be capable of 
coping with life or not. W h o knows? You are not confident about your 
intelligence so you hoard, you b e c o m e greedy. An intelligent person is 
not afraid, is not greedy. 
Greed and fear go together—that's w h y heaven and hell go together. 
Hell is fear, heaven is greed. Create fear in people and create greed in 
p e o p l e — m a k e t h e m as greedy as possible. Make t h e m so greedy that life 
cannot satisfy them, then they will go to the priest and to the leader. 
T h e n they will start fantasizing about some future life where their foolish 
desires and stupid fantasies will be fulfilled. Watch it—to demand the i m -
possible is to be unintelligent.

An intelligent person is perfectly satisfied with the possible. He 
works for the probable; he never works for the impossible and the i m -
probable, no. He looks at life and its limitations. He is n o t a perfectionist. 
A perfectionist is neurotic. If you are a perfectionist you will become 
neurotic. 
For example, if you love a w o m a n and you ask absolute fidelity, you 
will go m a d and she will go mad. This is not possible. Absolute fidelity 
means she will not even think, she will not even dream of another m a n — 
this is not possible. W h o are you? W h y has she fallen in love with you? 
Because you are a man. If she can fall in love with you, w h y can't she 
think of others? That possibility remains open. A n d h o w is she going to 
manage if she sees some beautiful person walking by and a desire arises in 
her? Even to say "This m a n is beautiful" is to desire—the desire has en-
tered. You only say that something is beautiful w h e n you feel it is worthy 
of being possessed, of being enjoyed. You are n o t indifferent. 
N o w if you ask absolute fidelity—as people have asked—then there 
is b o u n d to be conflict, and you will remain suspicious. A n d you will re-
main suspicious because you k n o w your mind, t o o — y o u think of other 
w o m e n , so h o w can you trust that your w o m a n is not thinking of other 
men? You k n o w what you are thinking, so you k n o w she is thinking the 
same things. N o w distrust arises, conflict, agony. T h e love that was possi-
ble has b e c o m e impossible because of an impossible desire. 
People ask that w h i c h cannot be done. You want security for the fu-
ture, w h i c h is not possible. You want absolute security for t o m o r r o w — i t 
cannot be guaranteed; it is not in the nature of life. An intelligent person 
knows that it is not in the nature of life. T h e future remains o p e n — t h e 
bank can go bankrupt, the wife can escape with somebody else, the hus-
band can die, the children may prove unworthy. W h o knows about t o -
morrow? You may fall ill, you may become crippled. W h o knows about 
tomorrow? 
To ask security for t o m o r r o w means to remain in constant fear. Se-
curity is n o t possible, so w h e n you are afraid of insecurity, your fear can-
not be destroyed. 
Fear will be there, you will be trembling—and

I n t e l l i g e n c e 
A 
G i l t 
o f 
N a t u r e 
meanwhile the present m o m e n t is being missed. W i t h the desire for se-
curity in the future you are destroying the present, w h i c h is the only life 
available. A n d m o r e and m o r e will you become shaken, afraid, greedy. 
A child is born; a child is a very, very open p h e n o m e n o n , utterly in-
telligent. But we j u m p u p o n him, we start destroying his intelligence. We 
start creating fear in him. You call it teaching, you call it making the child 
capable of coping with life. He is unafraid, and you create fear in him. 
A n d your schools, colleges, universities—they all make h i m m o r e 
and m o r e unintelligent. They demand foolish things. T h e y demand fool-
ish things to be memorized, things in w h i c h the child and his natural in-
telligence cannot see any point. For what? That child cannot see the 
point. W h y cram these things into his head? But the university says, the 
college says, the h o m e , the family, the well-wishers say, " C r a m ! You don't 
k n o w now, but later on you will k n o w w h y it is needed." 
C r a m history, all the nonsense that people have been doing to other 
people, all the madness—study it! A n d the child cannot see the point. 
W h a t does it matter w h e n a certain king ruled England, from what date 
to what date? But he has to m e m o r i z e those stupid things. Naturally, his 
intelligence becomes m o r e and m o r e burdened, crippled. M o r e and m o r e 
dust collects on his intelligence. By the time a person comes back from 
the university, he is unintelligent—the university has done its job. It is 
very rare that someone can graduate from the university and still remain 
intelligent. Very few people have been able to escape the university, to 
avoid it, pass through the university and yet save their intelligence—very 
rarely. It is such a great mechanism to destroy you. 
T h e m o m e n t you b e c o m e educated, you have become unintelligent. 
Can't you see this? The educated person behaves very 
unintelligently. Go to the primitive people who have never 
been educated, and you will find a pure intelligence functioning. 
I have heard . . . 
A w o m a n was trying to open a tin, and she could not figure 
out how to do it. So she went to look in the cookbook. By the 
5

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
time she looked into the book, the cook had opened it. She 
came back, and she was surprised. She asked the cook, " H o w did 
you do it?" 
He said, "Lady, w h e n you don't k n o w h o w to read, you have 
to use your intelligence!" 
Yes, it is right. W h e n you don't k n o w h o w to read you have to use 
your intelligence. W h a t else can you do? T h e m o m e n t you start reading— 
those three dangerous R s , w h e n you have b e c o m e capable in t h e m — y o u 
need not be intelligent, the books will take care of it. 
Have you watched it? W h e n a person starts typing, his handwriting is 
lost; then his handwriting is no longer beautiful. T h e r e is no need: T h e 
typewriter takes care of it. If you carry a calculator in your pocket, you 
will forget all mathematics—there is no need. Sooner or later everybody 
will be carrying small computers. They will have all the information of 
an Encyclopaedia Britannica, and then there will be no need for you to be 
intelligent at all; the computer will take care of it. 
Go to the primitive people, the uneducated people, the villagers, and 
you will find a subtle intelligence. Yes, they are not very informed, that is 
true. They are not knowledgeable, that is true—but they are tremendously 
intelligent. Their intelligence is like a flame with no smoke around it. 
T h e society has done something w r o n g with the h u m a n being—for 
certain reasons. It wants you to be slaves, it wants you to be always afraid. 
It wants you to be always greedy, it wants you to be always ambitious, it 
wants you to be always competitive. It wants you to be unloving, it 
wants you to be full of anger and hatred. It wants you to remain weak, 
imitative—carbon copies. It does not want you to b e c o m e original and 
unique and rebellious, no. That's w h y your intelligence has been d e -
stroyed. 
Meditation is needed only to u n d o what the society has done. M e d -
itation is negative: It simply negates the damage, it destroys the illness. 
A n d once the illness has gone, your well-being asserts itself of its o w n ac-
cord.

In the last century it has gone too far: Universal education has been 
a calamity. A n d remember, I am not against education, I am against this 
education. There is a possibility of a differ-
ent kind of education w h i c h will be help-
ful in sharpening your intelligence, not 
destroying it; w h i c h will not burden it 
with unnecessary facts, w h i c h will n o t 
burden it with unnecessary knowledge, 
w h i c h will not burden it at all, but rather 
will help it to become m o r e radiant, fresh, 
young. 
This education only makes you capa-
ble of memorizing. That education will 
make you capable of m o r e clarity. This ed-
ucation destroys your inventiveness. That 
education will help you to b e c o m e m o r e 
inventive. 
For 
example, the 
education 
that 
I 
would like in the world will not require a 
child to answer in the old stereotyped way. 
It will not encourage repetition, parroting. 
It will encourage inventiveness. Even if the 
invented answer is not as right as the copied answer can be, still it will ap-
preciate the child w h o has brought a n e w answer to an old problem. C e r -
tainly the child's answer cannot be as right as Socrates' answer—naturally, 
a small child's answer cannot be as exact as that of Albert Einstein. But to 
ask that the child's answer should be as right as that of Albert Einstein is 
foolish. If the child is inventive, he or she is moving in the right direc-
tion; one day the child will b e c o m e an Albert Einstein. If he is trying to 
create something n e w naturally, he has his limitations, but just his effort in 
trying to create something n e w should be appreciated, should be praised. 
Education should not be competitive. People should not be j u d g e d 
against each other. Competitiveness is very violent and very destructive.

Somebody is not good at mathematics and you call h i m mediocre. A n d 
he may be good at carpentry, but n o b o d y looks at that. Somebody is not 
good at literature and you call her stupid—and she will be good at music, 
at dance. 
A real education will help people to find their life where they can be 
fully alive. If a child is b o r n to be a carpenter, then that is the right thing 
for him to do. There should be n o b o d y to enforce anything else. This 
world can b e c o m e such a great, intelligent world if a child is allowed to 
be himself or herself, helped, supported in every way, and nobody inter-
feres. In fact, n o b o d y manipulates the child. If the child wants to become 
a dancer, then that is good—dancers are needed. M u c h dance is needed in 
the world. If the child wants to become a poet, good. M u c h poetry is 
needed; there is never enough. If the child wants to become a carpenter or 
a fisherman, perfectly good. If the child wants to become a woodcutter— 
perfectly good. T h e r e is no need to become a president or a prime m i n -
ister. In fact, fewer people will b e c o m e interested in those targets; it will 
be a blessing. 
R i g h t n o w everything is topsy-turvy. O n e w h o wanted to become a 
carpenter has b e c o m e a doctor; one w h o wanted to b e c o m e a doctor has 
b e c o m e a carpenter. Everybody is in somebody else's place, hence so 
m u c h unintelligence—everybody is doing somebody else's job. O n c e 
you start seeing it, you will understand w h y people are behaving unintel-
ligendy. 
In India we have been meditating deeply, and we have found one 
word: Swadharma, self-nature. That carries the greatest implication for a 
future world. Krishna has said, Swadharme nadhanam shreyah; "It is good 
to die in your o w n self-nature, following your self-nature." Per dharmo 
bavaha baha; "Somebody else's nature is very dangerous." D o n ' t b e c o m e 
an imitator. Just be yourself. 
I have heard . . . 
Bill always wanted to go moose hunting so he saved up 
enough m o n e y and went to the north woods. There he was fitted

out with necessary equipment and the storekeeper advised him 
to hire Pierre, the greatest moose caller in the land. 
"It's true," said the storekeeper, "that Pierre is expensive, but 
he has a sexy quality in his call that no moose can resist." 
" H o w does that work?" asked Bill. 
"Well," said the other, "Pierre will spot a moose at three 
hundred yards, then cup his hands and make his first call. W h e n 
the moose hears that, he will become excited with anticipatory 
desire and approach to two hundred yards. Pierre will then call 
again, putting a bit more o o m p h into it, and the moose will skip 
with eager glee to a distance of a hundred yards. This time 
Pierre really gives his call a sexy delivery, prolonging it a bit, 
which impels the moose, agitated with carnal intent, to come to 
a point only twenty-five yards away from you. And that is the 
time, my friend, for you to aim and shoot." 
"Suppose I miss?" wondered Bill. 
" O h , that would be terrible!" said the other. 
"But w h y ? " asked Bill. 
"Because then poor Pierre gets mated." 
That has happened to man—imitating, imitating. Man has c o m -
pletely lost the vision of his o w n reality. T h e Z e n people say: Seek out 
your original face. Find out what is your authenticity. W h o are you? If 
you don't k n o w w h o you are, you will always be in some accident— 
always. Your life will be a long series of accidents, and whatever happens 
it will never be satisfying. Discontent will be the only taste of your life. 
You can see it around you. W h y do so many people look so dull, 
bored, just passing the days somehow? Passing tremendously valuable 
time w h i c h they will not be able to recover—and passing with such dull-
ness, as if only waiting for death. W h a t has happened to so m a n y people? 
W h y don't they have the same freshness as the trees? W h y doesn't m a n 
have the same song as the birds? W h a t has happened to h u m a n beings? 
O n e thing has happened: M a n has been imitating. M a n has been trying

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
10 
to b e c o m e somebody else. N o b o d y is at h o m e . Everybody is knocking at 
somebody else's door; hence discontent, dullness, boredom, anguish. 
An intelligent person will try just to be himself, whatsoever the cost. 
An intelligent person will never copy, will never imitate. He will never 
parrot. An intelligent person will listen to his o w n intrinsic call. He will 
feel his o w n being and move accordingly, whatsoever the risk. 
There is risk! W h e n you copy others there is less risk. W h e n you 
don't copy anybody you are alone—there is risk! But life happens only to 
those w h o live dangerously. Life happens only to those w h o are adven-
turous, w h o are courageous, almost daredevils—only to them does life 
happen. Life does not happen to lukewarm people. 
Intelligence is trust in your o w n being. Intelligence is adventure, 
thrill, joy. Intelligence is to live in this m o -
ment, not to hanker for the future. Intelli-
gence is not to think of the past and not to 
bother about the future—the past is no 
more, the future is not yet. Intelligence is 
to make the utmost use of the present m o -
m e n t that is available. T h e future will 
come out of it. If this m o m e n t has been 
lived in delight and joy, the next m o m e n t is 
going to be b o r n out of it. It will bring 
m o r e joy naturally, but there is no need to 
bother about it. 
If my today has been 
golden, my t o m o r r o w will be even more 
golden. 
From where will it 
come? 
It 
will grow out of today. 
If this life has been a benediction, my 
next life will be a higher benediction. 
From where can it come? It will grow out 
of me, out of my lived experience. So an 
intelligent person is not concerned about heaven and hell, is not concerned 
about the afterlife, is not concerned even about God, is not concerned

Intelligence A Gift of Nature 
even about the soul. An intelligent person simply lives intelligently, and 
God and the soul and heaven and nirvana all follow naturally. 
You live in belief; belief is unintelligent. Live through knowing; 
knowing is intelligence. A n d intelligence is meditation. 
Unintelligent people also meditate, but certainly they meditate in an 
unintelligent way. They think that you have to go to the church every 
Sunday for one hour—that h o u r is to be given to religion. This is an u n -
intelligent way to be related to religion. W h a t has the church to do with 
it? Your real life is in the six days. Sunday is not your real day. You will 
live nonreligiously for six days, and then you go to the church just for 
one or two hours? W h o m are you trying to deceive? Trying to deceive 
G o d that you are a churchgoer . . . 
Or, if you try a little harder, then every day for twenty minutes in the 
morning, twenty in the evening, you do transcendental meditation. You 
sit with closed eyes and you repeat a mantra in a very stupid w a y — " O m , 
O m , O m " — w h i c h dulls the m i n d even more. To repeat a mantra m e -
chanically takes your intelligence away. It does not give you intelligence, 
it is like a lullaby. 
D o w n the centuries, mothers have k n o w n this. W h e n e v e r a child is 
restless and does not want to go to sleep, the m o t h e r comes and sings a 
lullaby. T h e child feels bored, and the child cannot escape. W h e r e to go? 
T h e m o t h e r is holding h i m on the bed. T h e only way to escape is in 
sleep. So he goes to sleep; he simply surrenders. He says, "It is foolish to 
be awake now, because she is doing such a boring thing, she goes on re-
peating just a single line." 
There are stories that mothers and grandmothers tell to children 
w h e n they don't go to sleep. If you look into these stories, you will find 
a certain pattern of constant repetition. Just the other day I was reading a 
story told by a grandmother to a small child w h o does not want to go to 
sleep, because he does not feel like sleeping right now. His intelligence says 
that he is perfectiy awake, but the grandmother is forcing him. She has 
other things to d o — t h e child is not important. 
Children are very puzzled, things look very absurd. W h e n they want 
11

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
12 
to sleep in the m o r n i n g , everybody wants to wake t h e m up. W h e n they 
don't want to go to sleep, everybody is forcing t h e m to sleep. T h e y b e -
come very puzzled. W h a t is the matter with these people? W h e n sleep 
comes, good—that is intelligence. W h e n it is n o t coming, it is perfectly 
good to be awake. 
So this old grandmother is telling a story. At first the child remains 
interested, but by and by . . . Any intelligent child will feel bored, only a 
stupid child will not feel bored. 
T h e story is: 
A man goes to sleep and dreams that he is standing before a great 
palace. And in the palace there are one thousand and one rooms. So he 
goes from one room to another—one thousand rooms—then he reaches 
the last room. And there is a beautiful bed, so he falls on the bed, falls 
asleep and dreams . . . that he is standing at the door of a big palace 
which has one thousand and one rooms. So he goes into one thousand 
rooms, then he reaches the one thousand and first room. Again there is a 
beautiful bed, so he goes to sleep . . . and dreams that he is standing b e -
fore a palace. . . . This is the way it goes! 
Now, h o w long can the child remain alert? Just out of sheer b o r e -
d o m the child falls asleep. He is saying, " N o w be finished!" 
A mantra does the same. You repeat, " R a m , R a m . . . O m , Om . . . Al-
lah, Allah"—or anything. You go on repeating, you go on repeating. N o w 
you are doing two jobs: both the grandmother's and the child's. Your intel-
ligence is like the child, and your learning of the mantra is like the grand-
mother. T h e child tries to stop you, gets interested in other things, thinks of 
beautiful things—beautiful women, beautiful scenes. But you catch him 
red-handed and bring h i m again to " O m , O m , O m . " By and by, your inner 
child feels that it is futile to struggle; the inner child goes to sleep. 
Yes, the mantra can give you a certain sleep: It is an autohypnotic 
sleep. There is nothing w r o n g in it if sleep is difficult for you—if you 
suffer from insomnia it is good. But it has nothing to do with spirituality; 
it is a very unintelligent way to meditate. 
T h e n what is the intelligent way to meditate? T h e intelligent way is

Intelligence A Gift of Nature 
to bring intelligence into everything that you do. Walking, walk intelli-
gently, with awareness. Eating, eat intelligently, with awareness. Do you 
remember ever eating intelligently? Ever thinking about w h a t you are 
eating? Is it nutritious? Has it any nutritional value, or are you just stuff-
ing yourself without any nourishment? 
Have you ever watched what you do? You go on smoking. T h e n in-
telligence is n e e d e d — w h a t are you doing? Just taking in smoke and 
throwing it out, and meanwhile destroying your lungs. A n d what are you 
really doing? Wasting money, wasting health. Bring intelligence in while 
you are smoking, while you are eating. Bring intelligence in w h e n you 
go and make love to your w o m a n or to your man. W h a t are you doing? 
Have you really any love? Sometimes you make love out of habit. T h e n 
it is ugly, then it is immoral. Love has to be very conscious, only then it 
becomes prayer. 
W h i l e making love to your w o m a n , what exactly are you doing? U s -
ing the woman's body to throw some energy that has become too m u c h 
for you? Or are you paying respect, are you loving to the w o m a n , do you 
have some reverence for the woman? 
I don't see it. Husbands don't respect their wives, they use them. 
Wives use their husbands, they don't respect them. If reverence does not 
arise out of love, then intelligence is missing somewhere. Otherwise you 
will feel tremendously grateful to the other, and your lovemaking will 
b e c o m e a great meditation. 
Whatever you are doing, bring the quality of intelligence into it. Do 
it intelligently: That's what meditation is. 
Intelligence has to spread all over your life. It is not a Sunday thing, 
and you cannot do it for twenty minutes and then forget about it. Intel-
ligence has to be just like breathing. Whatever you are doing—small, big, 
whatsoever, cleaning the floor—can be done intelligently or unintelli-
gently. A n d you k n o w that w h e n you do it unintelligently there is no 
J o y — y o u are doing a duty; carrying the burden of it somehow.

It happened in a church-school class of ninth-grade girls. T h e 
class was studying Christian love and what it might mean to 
them and their lives. They finally decided that Christian love 
meant "doing something lovable for 
someone you didn't like." Children 
are very intelligent. Their conclusion 
is perfectly right. Listen to it again. 
They finally 
decided that Christian 
love meant "doing something lovable 
for someone you didn't like." 
T h e teacher suggested that during 
the week they might test out their 
concept. W h e n they returned the fol-
lowing week, the teacher asked for re-
ports. O n e girl raised her hand and 
said, "I've done something!" 
T h e teacher replied, "Marvelous! 
W h a t did you do?" 
"Well," the girl said, "in my math 
class at school there is this glunky 
k i d — " 
"Glunky . . . . - ? " 
"Yes, you k n o w . . . glunky. She's 
got four heads, and she's all thumbs, 
and she's got three left feet, and w h e n 
she comes d o w n the hall in school, everyone says, 'Here comes 
that glunky kid again.' She doesn't have any friends, and n o b o d y 
asks her to parties, and you know, she's just glunky." 
T h e teacher said, "I think I k n o w just what you mean. So 
what did you d o ? " 
"Well, this glunky kid's in my math class, and she's having a 
tough time. I'm pretty good in math so I offered to help her 
with h o m e w o r k . "

"Wonderful," said the teacher. "And what happened?" 
"Well, I did help her, and it was fun, and she just couldn't 
thank me enough, but now, I can't get rid of her!" 
If you are doing something just as a duty—you don't love it, and you 
are doing it just as a duty—sooner or later you will be caught in it and 
you will be in a difficulty about h o w to get rid of it. Just watch in your 
twenty-four-hour day, h o w many things you are doing that you don't d e -
rive any pleasure from, that don't help your growth. In fact, you want to 
get rid of them. If you are doing too many things in your life that you re-
ally want to get rid of, you are living unintelligently. 
An intelligent person will make his or her life in such a way that it 
will have a poetry of spontaneity, of love, of joy. It is your life, and if you 
are not kind enough to yourself, w h o is going to be kind enough to you? 
If you are wasting your life, it is n o b o d y else's responsibility. 
I teach you to be responsible toward yourself—that is your first re-
sponsibility. Everything else comes next. 
You are the very center of your world, of your existence. So, be i n -
telligent. B r i n g in the quality of intelligence. A n d the m o r e intelligent 
you become, the m o r e capable you will be of bringing m o r e intelli-
gence into your life. Each single m o m e n t can b e c o m e so luminous with 
intelligence. . . . T h e n there is no need for any religion, no need to 
meditate, no need to go to the church, no need to go to any temple, no 
need for anything extra. Life in its intrinsicness is intelligent. Just live 
totally, harmoniously, in awareness, and everything else follows beauti-
fully. A life of celebration follows the luminousness of intelligence.

T h e intelligence of the head is not intelligence at all; it is knowledgeabil-
lty. T h e intelligence of the heart is the intelligence, the only intelligence 
there is. T h e head is simply an accumulator. It is always old, it is never 
15

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
16 
new, it is never original. It is good for certain purposes: For filing it is 
perfecdy good! A n d in life one needs this—many things have to be re-
membered. T h e mind, the head, is a biocomputer. You can go on 
accumulating knowledge in it and whenever you need it you can take it 
out. It is good for mathematics, good for 
calculation, good for the day-to-day life, 
the marketplace. But if you think this is 
your whole life then you will remain stu-
pid. You will never k n o w the beauty of 
feeling and you will never k n o w the bless-
ings of the heart. You will never k n o w the 
grace that descends only through the heart, 
the godliness that enters only through the 
heart. You will never k n o w prayer, you 
will never k n o w poetry, you will never 
k n o w love. 
T h e intelligence of the heart creates 
poetry in your life, gives a dance to your 
steps, makes your life a joy, a celebration, a 
festivity, a laughter. It gives you a sense of 
humor. It makes you capable of love, of sharing. That is true life. T h e life 
that is lived from the head is a mechanical life. You become a r o b o t — 
maybe very efficient. R o b o t s are very efficient, machines are m o r e effi-
cient than man. You can earn m u c h through the head, but you will not 
live m u c h . You may have a better standard of living but you w o n ' t have 
any life. 
Life is of the heart. Life can only grow through the heart. It is the 
soil of the heart where love grows, life grows, spirit grows. All that is 
beautiful, all that is really valuable, all that is meaningful, significant, 
comes through the heart. T h e heart is your very center, the head is just 
your periphery. To live in the head is to live on the circumference with 
out ever becoming aware of the beauties and the treasures of the center. 
To live on the periphery is stupidity.

To live in the head is stupidity. To live in the heart and use the head 
whenever it is needed is intelligence. But the center, the master, is at the 
very core of your being. 
T h e master is the heart, and the head is just a servant—this is intelli-
gence. W h e n the head becomes the master and forgets all about the heart, 
that is stupidity. 
It is up to you to choose. R e m e m b e r , the head as a slave is a beauti-
ful slave, of m u c h utility. But as a master it is a dangerous master and will 
destroy your w h o l e life, will poison your whole life. Look around! P e o -
ple's lives are absolutely poisoned, poisoned by the head. They cannot 
feel, they are no longer sensitive, nothing thrills them. T h e sun rises but 
nothing rises in them; they look at the sun empty-eyed. T h e sky becomes 
full of the stars—the marvel, the mystery!—but nothing stirs in their 
hearts, no song arises. Birds sing—man has forgotten to sing. Clouds 
come in the sky and the peacocks dance, and m a n does not k n o w h o w to 
dance. He has become a cripple. Trees b l o o m — a n d m a n thinks, never 
feels, and without feeling there is no flowering possible. 
Watch, scrutinize, observe, have another look at your life. N o b o d y 
else is going to help you. You have depended on others so long; that's 
w h y you have become stupid. Now, take care; it is your o w n responsibil-
ity. You owe it to yourself to have a deep, penetrating look at w h a t you 
are doing with your life. Is there any poetry in your heart? If it is not 
there, then don't waste time. Help your heart to weave and spin poetry. Is 
there any romance in your life or not? If there is not, then you are already 
in your grave. 
C o m e out of it! Let life have something of the romantic in it, s o m e -
thing like adventure. Explore! Millions of beauties and splendors are 
waiting for you. You go on moving around and around, never entering 
into the temple of life. T h e door is the heart. 
T h e real intelligence is of the heart. It is not intellectual, it is e m o -
tional. It is not like thinking, it is like feeling. It is not logic, it is love. 
Love is available only to those w h o go on sharpening their intelli-
gence. Love is not for the mediocre . . . love is not for the unintelligent. 
17

N T E L L I G E N C E 
T h e unintelligent person may b e c o m e a great intellectual. In fact u n i n -
telligent people try to b e c o m e intellectuals; that is their way of hiding 
their unintelligence. Love is not for the intellectual. Love needs a totally 
different kind of talent—a talented heart, not a talented head. 
Love has its o w n intelligence, its o w n way of seeing, perceiving, its 
o w n way of understanding life, its o w n way of comprehending the mys-
tery of existence. T h e poet is far closer to it than the philosopher. A n d 
the mystic is exactly inside the temple. T h e poet is on the steps and the 
philosopher is just outside. At the most he can approach the driveway, but 
never the steps. He goes on round and round. He goes on moving around 
the temple, studying the outer walls of the temple, and becomes so e n -
chanted that he forgets completely that the outer walls are not the real 
temple and that the deity is inside. 
T h e poet reaches the door, but the door is so beautiful that he becomes 
hypnotized. 
He thinks he has arrived— 
what more can there be? T h e philosopher is 
lost in guessing what is inside. He never 
goes there, he simply thinks, philosophizes. 
T h e poet tries to penetrate into the mystery 
but gets hooked near the door. T h e mystic 
enters into the very innermost sanctum of 
the temple. 
T h e way is love, and the way is a lov-
ing intelligence. W h e n love and intelli-
gence meet together you create the space 
in w h i c h all that is possible to a h u m a n b e -
ing can become actual. A loving intelli-
gence is what is needed. Intelligence alone 
becomes intellectual, love alone becomes 
sentimentality, but 
a loving intelligence 
never becomes intellectuality or sentimentality. It gives you a n e w kind 
of integrity, a n e w crystallization. 
18

A N OPENNESS O F BEING 
Intelligence is just an openness of being—capacity to see without preju-
dice, capacity to listen without interference, capacity to be with things 
without any a priori ideas about them—that's what intelligence is. Intel-
ligence is an openness of being. 
That's w h y it is so utterly different from intellectuality. Intellectual-
ity is just the opposite of intelligence. T h e intellectual person is c o n -
stantly carrying prejudices, information, a priori beliefs, knowledge. He 
cannot listen; before you have said anything, he has already concluded. 
Whatsoever you say has to pass through so many thoughts in his m i n d 
that by the time it reaches h i m it is something totally different. Great dis-
tortion happens in him, and he is very closed, almost blind and deaf. All 
experts, knowledgeable people, are blind. 
Do you k n o w the old story of the five blind people going to see an 
elephant? 
A teacher was telling her students, small girls and boys, this ancient 
fable. She told the w h o l e story, then she asked a small boy, " C a n you tell 
me w h o the people were w h o w e n t to see the elephant and then started 
quarreling?" She wanted to k n o w whether the boy had listened while she 
was teaching the story. 
A n d the boy stood up and said, "Yes, I know. They were the experts." 
She was thinking he would answer, " T h e y were five blind people." 
But the small boy said, " T h o s e were the experts." He is far m o r e right; 
yes, they were experts. All experts are blind. Expertise means you become 
blind to everything else. You k n o w m o r e and m o r e about less and less, 
and then one day you arrive at the ultimate goal of knowing all about 
nothing. T h e n you are completely closed and not even a w i n d o w is 
open; then you have b e c o m e windowless. 
This is unintelligence. Intelligence is to be open to wind, rain, and sun, 
to be open to all. N o t to carry the past is intelligence, to die to the past 
every m o m e n t is intelligence, to remain fresh and innocent is intelligence.

Donald was driving his sports car down the main avenue when 
suddenly he noticed to his rear a flashing red light. It was a p o -
lice car. 
Quickly Donald pulled over to the side. 
"Officer," 
he 
blurted, "I was only doing twenty-five in a thirty-five-mile 
zone." 
"Sir," said the officer, "I j u s t — " 
"Furthermore," interrupted Donald indignantly, "as a citi-
zen I resent being frightened like this!" 
"Please," continued the officer, "calm down, relax—" 
"Relax!" shouted Donald, overwrought. "You're going to 
give me a traffic ticket, and you want me to relax!" 
"Mister," pleaded the officer, "give me a chance to talk. I 
am not giving you a ticket." 
" N o ? " said Donald, astonished. 
"I just wanted to inform you that your right rear tire is flat." 
But n o b o d y is ready to listen to what the other is saying. Have you 
ever listened to what the other is saying? Before a w o r d is uttered, you 
have already concluded. Your conclusions have b e c o m e fixed; you are no 
longer liquid. 
To b e c o m e frozen is to become idiotic, to remain liquid is to remain 
intelligent. Intelligence is always flowing like a river. Unintelligence is 
like an ice cube, frozen. Unintelligence is always consistent, because it is 
frozen. It is definite, it is certain. Intelligence is inconsistent, it is flowing. 
It has no definition, it goes on moving according to situations. It is re-
sponsible, but it is n o t consistent. 
O n l y stupid people are consistent people. T h e m o r e intelligent you 
are, the m o r e inconsistent you will be—because w h o knows about t o -
morrow? T o m o r r o w will bring its o w n experiences. H o w can you be 
consistent with your yesterdays? If you are dead you will be consistent. If 
you are alive you have to be inconsistent—you have grown, the world has 
changed, the river is flowing into new territory.

Intelligence A Gift of Nature 
Yesterday the river was passing through a desert, today it is passing 
through a forest; it is totally different. Yesterday's experience should not 
become your definition forever; otherwise you died yesterday. 
O n e 
should be able to go on moving with time. O n e should remain a process, 
one should never become a thing. That is intelligence.

he mystics have compared man to a ladder. T h e ladder can be used 
for two things: You can use it to go upward, and you can use it to 
go downward. You use the same ladder for both purposes, only 
your direction changes. T h e ladder is the same, but the result will be t o -
tally different. 
M a n is a ladder between heaven and hell. That's w h y it is only h u -
m a n beings w h o repress, w h o manipulate, w h o kill, w h o try to conquer 
the natural flow of nature. O n l y h u m a n beings are stupid—and that is 
because they can be buddhas. Because h u m a n beings have intelligence, 
that's w h y they can be stupid. Stupidity does n o t mean the absence of in-
telligence, it simply means you have not used it. If there is no presence of 
intelligence you cannot call h u m a n beings stupid. You cannot call a rock 
stupid—a rock is a rock, there is no question of stupidity. But you can call 
humans stupid because with humans there is hope, a ray of great light. 
W i t h the h u m a n being, a door opens toward the beyond. M a n can tran-
scend himself and he is not doing it—that's his stupidity. He can grow, 
and he is not growing, he is clinging to all kinds of immaturity—that is 
his stupidity. He goes on and on living in the past, w h i c h is no m o r e — 
that is his stupidity. Or he starts projecting into the future, w h i c h is n o t 
yet—that is his stupidity. 
O n e should live in the present with deep passion, with great love, 
with intensity, with awareness, and that will b e c o m e your intelligence. It

is the same energy—upside d o w n it is stupidity; rearrange it, put it right, 
and it becomes intelligence. 
Intelligence and stupidity are not separate energies. T h e energy that 
functions in h a r m o n y is intelligence, the same energy functioning in 
contradictions is stupidity. M a n can be stupid—but don't think this is 
unfortunate. It appears on the surface that it is unfortunate, but hidden 
behind it is great glory, great splendor, w h i c h can be discovered. 
But the society—the so-called religions, the state, the crowd—wants 
you to be stupid. N o b o d y wants you to be intelligent. They all condition 
you to remain stupid your w h o l e life for the simple reason that stupid 
people are obedient. Intelligent people start thinking on their own; they 
start becoming individuals. T h e y start having their o w n life, their o w n 
lifestyle, their o w n way of seeing, of being, of growing. T h e y are no 
longer part of the crowd—they cannot be. T h e y have to leave the crowd 
behind, only then can they grow. A n d the crowd feels offended; the 
crowd does not want anybody to be m o r e than the "average p e r s o n " — 
one w h o becomes m o r e intelligent, m o r e individual, m o r e aware, will 
not be any longer part of the m o b psychology. 
You cannot force a buddha to follow stupid people, and the stupid 
people are m a n y — t h e majority, 99.9 percent. T h e y have a great power 
with them, the power of violence—and they show it whenever it is 
needed. 
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST 
T h e h u m a n being is in a dilemma for the simple reason that he is not 
only intelligent, he is also aware of his intelligence. That is something 
unique about man—his privilege, his prerogative, his glory—but it can 
turn very easily into his agony. M a n is conscious that he is intelligent. 
That consciousness brings its o w n problems. T h e first problem is that it 
creates ego. 
Ego does not exist anywhere else except in h u m a n beings, and ego 
23

starts growing as the child grows. T h e parents, the schools, colleges, uni 
versity, they all help to strengthen the ego for the simple reason that for 
centuries m a n had to struggle to survive, and the idea has become a fixa 
tion, a deep unconscious conditioning, that 
only strong egos can survive in the strug 
gle of life. Life has b e c o m e just a struggle 
to survive. A n d scientists have made it even 
m o r e convincing with the theory of the 
"survival of the fittest." So we help every 
child to become m o r e and m o r e strong in 
the ego, and it is there that the problem 
arises. 
As the ego becomes strong it starts sur-
rounding intelligence like a thick layer of 
darkness. Intelligence is light, ego is dark-
ness. Intelligence is very delicate, ego is 
very hard. Intelligence is like a rose flower, 
ego is like a rock. A n d if you want to sur-
vive, they say—the so-called authorities— 
then you have to become rocklike, you 
have to be strong, invulnerable. You have to 
become a citadel, a closed citadel, so you 
cannot be attacked from outside. You have 
to become impenetrable. 
But then you become closed. T h e n you start dying as far as your i n -
telligence is concerned because intelligence needs the open sky, the wind, 
the air, the sun in order to grow, to expand, to flow. To remain alive it 
needs a constant flow; if it becomes stagnant it becomes, slowly, a dead 
p h e n o m e n o n . 
We don't allow children to remain intelligent. T h e first thing is that 
if they are intelligent they will be vulnerable, they will be delicate, they 
will be open. If they are intelligent they will be able to see many falsities 
in the society—in the state, in the church, in the educational system. 
24

W h a t 
M a k e s 
P e o p l e

They will become rebellious. T h e y will be individuals; they will not be 
cowed easily. You can crush them, but you cannot enslave them. You can 
destroy them, but you cannot force t h e m to compromise. 
In one sense intelligence is very soft, like a rose flower, in another 
sense it has its o w n strength. But that strength is subtle, not gross. That 
strength is the strength of rebellion, of a noncompromising attitude. O n e 
is ready to die, one is ready to suffer, but one is not ready to sell one's 
soul. 
A n d the w h o l e society needs slaves; it needs people w h o function 
like robots, machines. It does not want people, it wants mechanisms. 
Hence the w h o l e conditioning is to make the ego strong. It serves a d o u -
ble purpose. First, it gives the person the feeling that n o w he can struggle 
in life. A n d secondly it serves the purposes of all the vested interests. 
They can exploit the person; they can use h i m as a means to their o w n 
ends. 
Hence the w h o l e educational system rotates around the idea of a m -
bition; it creates ambitiousness. Ambitiousness is nothing but ego. " B e -
come the first, become the most famous. Become a prime minister or a 
president. Become world k n o w n , leave your mark on history." It does 
not teach you to live totally. It does n o t teach you to love totally. It does 
not teach you to live gracefully, it teaches you h o w to exploit others for 
your o w n purposes. A n d we think that the people w h o are clever are the 
ones w h o succeed. They are cunning, but we call them clever. T h e y are 
not intelligent people. 
An intelligent person can never use another person as a means; he 
will respect the other. An intelligent person will be able to see the equal-
ity of all. Yes, he will see the differences too, but differences make no dif-
ference as far as equality is concerned. He will have tremendous respect 
for others' freedom—he cannot exploit them, he cannot reduce them to 
things, he cannot make t h e m stepping-stones to the fulfillment of some 
absurd desire to be the first. Hence we go on conditioning children. 
But before that conditioning happens, children are immensely intel-
ligent. It has been said by Buddha, by Lao Tzu, by Jesus, by all the awak-

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
ened ones. Jesus says: Unless you are like a small child there is no h o p e 
for you. Again he says: Unless you b e c o m e like small children you can-
not enter into my k i n g d o m of God. Again and again he repeats one of 
his most famous beatitudes: Blessed are those w h o are the last in this 
world, because they will be the first in my k i n g d o m of God. He is teach-
ing nonambitiousness—to be the last. He says: Blessed are the meek, for 
theirs is the k i n g d o m of G o d — t h e meek, the humble, the people w h o 
are standing last in the queue. It was natural, very natural, that the society 
he was b o r n in was against him, because he was destroying the very roots 
of their ambitiousness. 
A n d Jews have been very ambitious people, so m u c h so that for cen-
turies, against all hazards, they have carried the idea in their minds that 
they are the chosen people of God. A thousand and one calamities have 
happened because of this stupid idea; if they can drop it they will be 
m o r e accepted in the world. But they cannot drop it—their w h o l e ego is 
involved in it. A n d it is an ancient ego, at least three thousand years old. 
Since Moses they have been carrying the idea that they are the chosen 
people of God. A n d here comes this m a n w h o says, "Be the last!" We are 
meant to be the first, and he says, "Be humble and meek!" A n d we are the 
chosen people! If we are humble and meek then those w h o are not c h o -
sen will b e c o m e the first! A n d Jews are earthly people; they don't bother 
m u c h about the other world. They are worldly: " W h o knows about the 
other world? He is saying, 'If you are the last here you will be the first in 
my k i n g d o m of God.' But where is your k i n g d o m of God? It may be just 
a fiction, just a dream." 
Jesus looks like a dreamer, a poet maybe. But he is destroying their 
very foundation. T h e y cannot forgive him; they have not even forgiven 
h i m yet. They still carry the idea that " w e are the chosen people." They 
have suffered m u c h for it; the m o r e they have suffered the stronger the 
idea has become—because if you have to face suffering, you have to be-
come more and m o r e egoistic, more rocklike, so that you can fight, strug-
gle, so that nobody can destroy you. But they have also b e c o m e very 
closed.

Jesus was creating an opening for them; they refused him. He was 
telling them to come into the open sky. He was telling them to be just 
ordinary: " D r o p this nonsense of being special." If they had listened to 
Jesus their whole history would have been different, but they could n o t 
listen. 
Hindus did not listen to Buddha for the same reason—Hindus are 
also carrying the idea they are the holiest people in the world and their 
land is the holiest land. Even the gods long to be b o r n in India! No other 
country is so holy. A n d Buddha said, "This is all nonsense!" T h e y had to 
reject him. Buddhism was thrown out of India. No society can tolerate 
such people, w h o are telling the truth, because they seem to sabotage the 
very structure of things. 
But n o w the time has come w h e n we have suffered enough. All over 
the world, in different ways, people have suffered m u c h , and it is time to 
have a look at history and its stupidity and its ridiculousness and drop the 
whole idea of these egoistic patterns. 
Watch small children and then you will see their intelligence. True, they 
are not knowledgeable. If you want t h e m to be knowledgeable, then you 
will not think that they are intelligent. If you ask them questions that d e -
pend on information, then they will look not intelligent. But ask t h e m 
real questions, w h i c h have nothing to do with information, w h i c h need 
an immediate response, and see—they are far m o r e intelligent than you 
are. Of course your ego w o n ' t allow you to accept it, but if you can ac-
cept it, it will help tremendously. It will help you, it will help your chil-
dren, because if you can see their intelligence you can learn m u c h from 
them. 
Even though the society destroys your intelligence it cannot destroy 
it totally; it only covers it with many layers of information. A n d the 
whole function of meditation is to take you deeper into yourself. It is a 
method of digging into your o w n being to the point w h e n you come to 
the living waters of your o w n intelligence, w h e n you discover the springs 
27

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
of your o w n intelligence. W h e n you have discovered your child again, 
w h e n you are reborn, then, only then will you understand w h y the b u d -
dhas have been emphasizing again and again that children are really intel-
ligent. 
Start watching children, their responses—not their answers but their 
responses. D o n ' t ask t h e m foolish questions, ask t h e m something i m m e -
diate w h i c h does n o t depend on information and see their response. 
T h e m o t h e r was preparing little Pedro to go to a party. 
W h e n she finished combing his hair she straightened his shirt 
collar and said, " G o now, son. Have a good time . . . and behave 
yourself!" 
" C o m e on, Mother!" said Pedro. "Please decide before I 
leave w h i c h it is going to be!" 
You see the point? T h e child's response is really of tremendous value. 
He says, "Please decide before I leave w h i c h it is going to be. If you al-
low me to have a good time, then I cannot behave; if you want me to b e -
have, then I cannot have a good time." T h e child can see the contradiction 
so clearly; it may not have been apparent to the mother. 
A passerby asks a boy, "Son, can you please tell me what time 
it is?" 
"Yes, of course," replies the boy, "but what do you need it 
for? It's always changing!" 
A new traffic sign was put in front of the school. It read:

T h e father was telling stories to his sons in the living room after 
dinner. " M y great-grandfather fought in the war against Rosas 
in Brazie, my uncle fought in the war against the Kaiser, my 
grandfather fought in the war of Spain against the Republicans, 
and my father fought in the Second World War against the 
Germans." 
To which the smallest son replied, "What's w r o n g with this 
family? They can't relate to anybody!" 
STRIVING FOR EFFICIENCY 
You will be surprised to k n o w that your schools, colleges, and universities 
don't exist, in fact, to help you to b e c o m e intelligent—no, not at all. I 
have been associated with universities as a student and then as a professor, 
for many years. I k n o w the very inner structure of your educational sys-
tem. It is not concerned with creating intelligence in people. Of course 
it wants to create efficiency—but efficiency is not intelligence, effi-
ciency is mechanical. A computer can be very efficient, but a computer is 
not intelligent. 
Never think that intelligence and efficiency are synonymous. Intelli-
gence is a totally different p h e n o m e n o n . Efficiency is not intelligence, it 
is mechanical expertise. T h e universities are concerned with creating ef-
ficiency so that you can be better clerks and better bureaucrats and m a n -
agers. But they are not concerned with creating intelligence—in fact, 
they are all against intelligence. T h e w h o l e structure of your educational 
system all over the world is to make you m o r e and m o r e capable of 
memorizing things.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
M e m o r y is a biocomputer. Intelligence is a totally different p h e -
n o m e n o n . Intelligence arises out of meditation, intelligence arises out of 
rebellion. Intelligence does not arise out of memory. But your examina-
tions only concern themselves with your memory. W h o e v e r has a better 
m e m o r y is thought to be m o r e intelligent. But it happens many times 
that stupid people have beautiful memories, and intelligent people are 
not so good as far as m e m o r y is concerned. 
T h o m a s Edison was not good as far as m e m o r y is concerned. He in-
vented hundreds of scientific gadgets; n o b o d y else before h i m had in-
vented so many things. Just the quantity of his inventions is enormous, 
unbelievable. You may not be aware that you are using Edison's inven-
tions every day: T h e gramophone record, the radio, the electric bulb, the 
fan, the loudspeaker—all these things come from the creativity of one 
single person, Edison. But his m e m o r y was lousy, very sloppy, so m u c h so 
that once he even forgot his o w n name, w h i c h is really very difficult! It is 
almost impossible to forget your o w n name. If you can forget your o w n 
name you can forget anything. He managed to do the least likely thing. 
In the First World War, rationing came for the first time into exis-
tence in America, and he was standing in a queue to take his ration card. 
Slowly he came closer to the window. T h e n the last person in front of 
h i m moved and they called his name: " T h o m a s Alva Edison!" A n d he 
looked around as if they were calling somebody else; he looked up and 
d o w n the queue . . . 
O n e m a n recognized him, and said, "As far as I know, you are 
T h o m a s Alva Edison. W h y you are looking here and there?" 
Edison said, "You are right! I had completely forgotten! M a n y 
thanks that you reminded me. Yes, I am T h o m a s Alva Edison." 
His wife used to have to keep everything in order because his w h o l e 
r o o m was in constant chaos—thousands of papers, research papers—and 
whenever he wanted to find something it w o u l d take days to figure out 
where it was. He kept forgetting everything. He might have invented 
something and would start inventing it again. A n d his wife would remind 
him, "You have done it! It is already in the market!" 
30

He used to keep loose papers around, and would go on writing d o w n 
whatever thought came to his mind. T h e n those loose papers would be 
lost here and there. His wife told him, "It would be better if you would 
keep a notebook." 
He said, "That's a beautiful idea! W h y did it never occur to m e ? " But 
then he lost the whole notebook! He said, "Look what happened w h e n I 
followed your suggestion. W i t h loose papers at least one thing was 
good—once in a while I would lose a few notes, but not all of them. 
N o w all my notes are lost!" 
Albert Einstein was not a m a n w h o had a good memory. He failed 
many exams in school simply because he could not memorize anything. 
This greatest mathematician of all the ages, and for ages to come, was in-
capable of counting small amounts of money. He would have to count 
again and again. O n c e he was traveling in a bus. He gave the conductor 
some money; the change was returned to him. He counted it once, twice, 
thrice, and each time the result was different, so he started counting the 
fourth time. 
T h e conductor was watching and he said, " W h a t is the matter with 
you? D o n ' t you k n o w figures? Thrice you have counted, n o w you are 
counting a fourth time! D o n ' t you k n o w h o w to count change?" 
Einstein said, "Yes, I am a little lousy in math." 
This man w h o had worked out the greatest mathematics possible was 
incapable of counting small amounts of money. He would go into his 
bathroom and would not come out for hours because he would forget 
where he was and that he should come out. O n e of my friends, Doctor 
R a m Manohar Lohia, w e n t to see him. He told me, "I had to wait six 
hours because he was in the bathroom! A n d his wife kept apologizing 
again and again. She said, ' H e is in the bathroom, he is still in the bath-
room.' I said, 'But what is he doing in the bathroom?' T h e wife said, ' N o -
body knows . . . but if you disturb h i m he becomes very angry—he starts 
throwing things! But he always forgets; whenever he goes in there he for-
gets to come out. N o w we have to wait until whenever he comes. W h e n 
he starts to feel h u n g r y or thirsty or something, then he will remember.' " 
31

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
D o c t o r Lohia asked, "But what is he doing in there?" 
T h e wife said, "I have also been curious about that for all these years. 
In the beginning I used to peep through the keyhole—what is he doing? 
He sits in the bathtub playing with soap bubbles! W h e n I asked him, 
W h a t are you doing?' he said, 'Don't disturb m e — n e v e r disturb me, b e -
cause it is in playing with soap bubbles that I have discovered the theory 
of relativity. It is through playing with soap bubbles that I came to u n -
derstand that the universe is expanding just 
like a soap bubble. It goes on expanding 
and one day it will burst—just like a soap 
b u b b l e ! ' " 
If you look d o w n the ages you will find 
thousands of geniuses with very bad m e m -
ories and thousands of people w h o had 
tremendous memories with no intelligence 
at all—because m e m o r y and intelligence 
come from different sources. M e m o r y is 
part of the mind—intelligence is part of no-
mind. 
Intelligence 
is part of your con-
sciousness, and m e m o r y is part of your 
brain. 
T h e brain can be trained—that's 
what the universities go on doing. All your 
examinations are tests for your memory, not 
for your intelligence. T h e universities give 
you the w r o n g impression—as if m e m o r y is 
intelligence. It is not. 
This w h o l e educational system exists 
to destroy intelligence or to divert you from intelligence toward m e m -
ory. M e m o r y is useful, utilitarian. Intelligence is dangerous; it has no 
utility for the status quo, it has no utility for the vested interests. Intelli-
gent people have always proved to be difficult people just because of 
their intelligence. T h e y cannot b o w d o w n to any stupid thing. A n d our 
society is full of superstitions, stupidities—all kinds of nonsense prevails

REPRESSION A N D M A N I P U L A T I O N 
Each child is distracted, is diverted. Hence there is so m u c h stupidity. It is 
really a miracle how a few people have escaped from this prison—a B u d -
dha, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu, a Jesus, a Pythagoras . . . very few people. It 
is almost impossible to escape from this prison because the prison is all 
around, and it starts from the very beginning. From your very childhood 
you are conditioned to be a prisoner—a Christian, a Hindu, a M o -
hammedan. A n d w h e n you are prisoners of churches, nations, races, then 
naturally there is going to be violence. 
No animal is as violent as man. Animals kill but they kill only w h e n 
they are hungry, otherwise not. M a n is the. only animal w h o enjoys 
killing for no reason at all, as if killing in itself is a blissful activity. 
O n e day in a restaurant a lion and a hare entered. T h e manager 
was shocked; he could not believe his eyes. A great silence fell 
over the restaurant. M a n y people were there eating, talking, gos-
siping; all became absolutely silent. W h a t was happening? T h e 
manager rushed to the n e w customers. S o m e h o w he managed 
to stammer to the hare, " W h a t would you like, sir?" 
T h e hare asked for coffee. T h e manager asked, " A n d what 
would your friend like to have?" 
T h e hare laughed and he said, " D o you think if he were 
h u n g r y I would be here? He is not hungry; otherwise he would 
have eaten his breakfast and I would be gone! We can be t o -
gether only w h e n he is not hungry." 
A Hon w o n ' t kill if he is not hungry. It is only m a n w h o kills for no 
reason at all—for stupid ideas. O n e can understand—if somebody is 
33

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
34 
hungry, one can understand. But one cannot understand Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki—destroying a hundred thousand people within three minutes, 
just for the sheer joy of destruction. 
This is happening because we have not allowed man's intelligence to 
flower. A n d whenever it has happened in any society that intelligence is al-
lowed a little freedom, that society has become weaker than other soci-
eties. It happened in India: India remained a slave for two thousand years 
for many reasons. O n e of the reasons was the great revolution that was 
brought by Krishna, Patanjali, Saraha, Mahavira, Buddha. These people 
brought such a great revolution, such a radical change in the consciousness 
of India, that many people were released from the bondage of stupidity; a 
great intelligence was released. T h e result was that the intelligent people 
stopped killing, they became nonviolent; they refused to be recruited into 
the army. Buddhists and Jains refused to be recruited into the army, the 
Brahmins refused to be recruited into the army. N o w this was the cream, 
and the cream refused to fight. T h e n very stupid countries and very ordi-
nary p e o p l e — H u n s , Turks, Moghuls, w h o were backward in every possi-
ble way—overran the country. A n d because the most intelligent people of 
the younger generation were no longer interested in killing and violence, 
there was no resistance, no fight. These people conquered the country—a 
big country was conquered by very small countries. For two thousand 
years India remained in slavery for that simple reason. 
T h e same thing happened in Athens. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Pythago-
ras, Heraclitus . . . these were the people w h o released great intelligence, and 
a climate was created of freedom, of free thinking. It was one of the most 
beautiful phenomena that was happening on the earth, and it was destroyed 
by stupid people, barbarians. T h e whole Greek civilization disappeared. 
My o w n suggestion is that unless we create a world government, in-
telligence cannot be allowed. T h e time has c o m e for a world govern-
ment. National governments are no longer needed: They are things of 
the past, they are part of our stupid past. Nations are no longer needed, 
only a world government. A n d if there is a world government it will have 
a totally different quality.

W h a t

Armies will have to be reduced, because there will be no question of 
fighting with anybody. N o w seventy percent of the world's money, 
wealth, resources goes to the military and military weapons—seventy 
percent! Only thirty percent is left for other purposes. That means sev-
enty percent of our energy is devoted to killing, to being violent, to b e -
ing destructive. 
A world government is an absolute necessity to save humanity. A n d 
the quality of the world government will be totally different because it 
w o n ' t need great armies; just small police forces will.be enough. It will 
take care of all things like the post office, the railway, the airplanes, et 
cetera—but they are not destructive; they serve people. A n d once the 
armies disappear from the world, great intelligence will be released— 
because the army is destructive of intelligence. It recruits the healthiest 
people and destroys their minds, because a real soldier is possible only if 
the person becomes absolutely mechanical. 
M a n kills for no reason. M a n tries to repress rather than to under-
stand, to manipulate rather than to relate, because to relate with some-
body needs great understanding. 
Manipulation needs no understanding. Repression is easy, very 
easy—any fool can do it. That's w h y if you go to the monasteries you 
will find all kinds of repressions and you will find all kinds of fools gath-
ered together there. I have never c o m e across intelligent m o n k s and nuns; 
if they are intelligent they will not be m o n k s and nuns anymore. T h e y 
will renounce that nonsense, they will come out of their so-called reli-
gious prisons. But repression needs no wisdom; it simply needs a power-
ful ego, so you can go on suppressing everything into the unconscious. 
But whatever you suppress will have to be suppressed again and again— 
and still it will never be eliminated. It will become m o r e and m o r e p o w -
erful as you grow older because you will become weaker. T h e suppressor 
will become weaker and the suppressed will remain fresh and young, b e -
cause it has never been used. 
T h e real problem arises in old age w h e n suppression starts exploding 
and creates all kinds of ugliness. It is five thousand years of suppression

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
36 
that is creating all our neuroses, all our perversions. Suppress sex and you 
will b e c o m e m o r e sexual; your whole life will be colored with sex. You 
will think always in terms of sexuality and nothing else. Suppress sex and 
the ugly institution of prostitution will arise, is bound to arise. T h e m o r e 
suppressive a society is, the m o r e prostitutes will be found there; the p r o -
portion is always the same. You can count your nuns and monks and you 
can k n o w by counting them h o w many male and female prostitutes will 
be in the country. It will be exactly the same n u m b e r because nature keeps 
a balance. A n d perversions . . . because sexual energy will find its ways, its 
o w n ways. Either it will create neurosis or hypocrisy. Both are ill states. T h e 
poor will become neurotic and the rich will become hypocrites. 
It is said that w h e n Moses in his rage smashed the tablets of the Ten 
C o m m a n d m e n t s , everybody rushed to grab a piece. 
Of course the rich and the politicians were the first. They got all the 
good pieces on w h i c h were inscribed, " C o m m i t adultery," "lie," "steal." 
T h e poor and all the rest got only the pieces that said, " T h o u shalt not," 
" T h o u shalt not." 
Repression creates cunningness. You lose authenticity, you lose natu-
ralness, spontaneity You lose truth. You start lying to others, you start ly-
ing to yourself. You start finding ways to he and to go on lying. A n d a 
single lie will need a thousand other lies to protect it, to support it. 
THE SIN OF DISOBEDIENCE 
It is said that w h e n H e n r y Thoreau came out of the university, Emerson 
gave a big party to celebrate the occasion. A n d he told the participants, "I 
am giving this party not because Thoreau has attained great knowledge 
in the university but because he has been able to come back from the 
university and he is still intelligent. T h e university has not been able to 
destroy his intelligence. T h e university has failed, that's w h y I am giving 
this party! I respect this young m a n for the simple reason that he has es-
caped from the w h o l e cunning strategy that is our education."

What Makes People Stupid 
Intelligence simply means the ability to respond, because life is a flux. 
You have to be aware and to see what is demanded of you, what is the 
challenge of the situation. T h e intelligent person behaves according to 
the situation, and the stupid behaves according to the ready-made an-
swers. W h e t h e r those answers come from Buddha, Christ, or Krishna, he 
always carries "scriptures" around himself. He is afraid to depend on 
himself. T h e intelligent person depends on his o w n insight. He trusts his 
o w n being. He loves and respects himself. T h e unintelligent person r e -
spects others. 
And you can see the p o i n t — w h y are 
the vested interests interested in creating 
stupidity? Because that is the only way they 
can get respect. No parents really want 
their children to be intelligent, because if 
the children are intelligent they are rebel-
lious, too; they are disobedient, too. O b e d i -
ence has been imposed on you as a great 
value—it is not. It is one of the basic causes 
of the destruction of your intelligence. 
I am not saying be disobedient. I am 
simply saying that w h e n you feel like being 
obedient, be obedient; w h e n you feel like 
being disobedient, be 
true 
to 
yourself. 
Your only responsibility is toward yourself 
and nobody else. 
An intelligent person takes risks. He 
will be ready to die rather than to c o m p r o -
mise. Of course, he will not fight about 
unnecessary things, he will not fight about 
nonessentials—but as far as the essentials 
are concerned he is n o t going to be obedient. 
But you have obeyed even about the essentials. W h a t is your belief in 
God? You have simply obeyed others. W h a t do you k n o w about God? 
37

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
38 
You have simply obeyed; you have followed your parents, and they fol-
lowed their parents. Parents are happy with unintelligent children b e -
cause they are obedient—they have to be obedient. T h e children come to 
k n o w one thing, that whatever they do is b o u n d to be wrong, so it is bet-
ter to listen to the parents' advice. 
For thousands of years every society has been telling children, " R e -
spect your parents," because they are afraid of children—they may not 
respect their parents. A n d I am not saying to disrespect your parents. I am 
simply saying that you must first respect yourself. O u t of that respect, you 
can respect your parents, your teachers—you can respect everybody. But 
if you don't respect yourself, your respect for anybody else is going to be 
false; deep d o w n there will be hatred. Each child hates his parents . . . 
deep d o w n he feels, " T h e parents are my enemies." He can see h o w his 
intelligence is being crippled. 
After putting her two children to bed one night, a young m o t h e r 
changed into a ragged blouse and an old pair of slacks and p r o -
ceeded to wash her hair. All during the shampoo she could hear 
the children growing wilder and noisier. Finishing as hurriedly 
as possible, she wrapped a large towel around her head, stormed 
into their room, and put t h e m back to bed with a stern warning 
to stay there. As she left, she heard the two-year-old say to his 
sister in a trembling voice, " W h o was that?" 
This is intelligence! 
But the society is not interested in intelligent people. It is not inter-
ested in seekers, it is interested in soldiers. It wants to create soldiers. A n d 
unless you are stupid you cannot be a good soldier. T h e greater you are in 
your stupidity the better, as far as being a soldier is concerned. 
As the last soldier was about to j u m p from the airplane he 
panicked, grabbed hold of his sergeant and said, " W h a t happens 
if my second parachute doesn't open, either?"

What Makes People Stupid 
" D o n ' t worry," said the sergeant with a smile. "Just come 
back and I will give you a n e w one!" 
Life is a beautiful j o u r n e y if it is a process of constant learning, ex-
ploration. T h e n it is excitement every m o m e n t , because every m o m e n t 
you are opening a new door, every m o m e n t you are coming in contact 
with a n e w mystery. 
T h e word disciple means one w h o learns, and discipline means the p r o -
cess of learning. But the w o r d has been prostituted. N o w discipline means 
obedience. T h e y have turned the w h o l e world into a Boy Scout camp. 
H i g h above there is somebody w h o k n o w s — y o u need not learn, you 
have simply to obey. T h e y have turned the meaning of discipline into its 
very opposite. 
Learning automatically consists of doubting, of questioning, of b e -
ing skeptical, of being curious—not of being a believer certainly, because 
a believer never learns. But they have used the w o r d for thousands of 
years in this way. A n d it is n o t only one w o r d that they have prostituted, 
they have prostituted m a n y words. Beautiful words have become so ugly 
in the hands of the vested interests that you cannot even imagine the 
original meaning of the w o r d . . . thousands of years of misuse. 
T h e y want everybody to be disciplined the way people are disci-
plined in the army. You are ordered and you have to do it without asking 
why. This is not the way of learning! A n d from the very beginning they 
have imposed stories on the minds of people—for example that the first 
sin committed was disobedience. A d a m and Eve were expelled from the 
Garden of Eden because they disobeyed. 
I have looked at it in thousands of ways, but I don't see that A d a m 
and Eve committed any sin or any crime. They were simply exploring. 
You are in a garden and you start exploring the fruits and flowers and 
what is edible and what is not edible. 
And G o d is responsible, because he prohibited t h e m from two trees. 
He indicated the trees: "You should not approach these two trees. O n e is 
the tree of wisdom, and the other is the tree of eternal life." Just think, if 
39

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
you were A d a m and Eve—was not G o d himself tempting you to go to 
these two trees? A n d those two trees were of wisdom and of eternal 
life—why should G o d be against them? If he were really a father, one 
w h o loved you, he might have pointed to them, saying, "This is a poi-
sonous tree, don't eat from it." Or, "This is the tree of death; if you eat 
anything from it you will die." But these t w o trees are perfectly good! Eat 
as m u c h as you can, because to be wise and to have eternal life is ab-
solutely right. 
Every father would want his children to have wisdom and eternal 
life. This father seems to be absolutely loveless. N o t only loveless but, as 
the devil said to Eve, " H e has prevented you from these two trees. Do 
you k n o w the reason? T h e reason is that if you eat from these two trees 
you will be equal to him, and he is jealous. He does not want you to b e -
come divine. He does not want you to b e c o m e gods, full of wisdom and 
eternal life." 
I cannot see that the devil's argument has any flaw in it. It is ab-
solutely right. In fact, he is the first benefactor of humanity. W i t h o u t 
him, perhaps there would have been no h u m a n i t y — n o Gautam Buddha, 
no Kabir, no Christ, no Zarathustra, no Lao T z u . . . just buffaloes and 
donkeys, all eating grass, chewing grass contentedly. A n d G o d would have 
been very happy, that his children are very obedient! 
But this obedience is poison, pure poison. T h e devil must be 
counted as the first revolutionary of the world, and the first m a n to think 
in terms of evolution, of wisdom, of eternal life. 
JUST F O L L O W I N G ORDERS 
All over the world, in every army, they are turning millions of people 
into machines—of course, in such a way that you don't understand what 
is going on. Their methodology is very indirect. 
W h a t does it m e a n that thousands of people every m o r n i n g are 
marching, following orders: " R i g h t turn, left turn, move forward, move 
40

What Makes People Stupid 
backward." For what is all this circus g o -
ing on? And for years it goes on. 
This is to destroy your intelligence. 
For years continuously you go on follow-
ing any kind of stupid order, meaningless, 
every day in the m o r n i n g , every day in 
the evening—and you are n o t supposed 
to ask why. You just have to do it, to do it 
as perfectly as possible; there is no need 
for you to understand why. A n d w h e n a 
person goes through such a training for 
years, the natural effect is that he stops 
asking why. 
T h e questioning attitude is the very 
base of all intelligence. T h e m o m e n t you 
stop asking why, you have stopped growing 
as far as intelligence is concerned. 
It happened in the Second World War . . . 
A retired army m a n . . . he had fought in the First World 
War and he was honored; he was a brave man. A n d n o w almost 
twenty-five years had passed. He had a small farm and lived 
silently. 
He was going from the farm to the town with a bucketful 
of eggs, and a few people in a restaurant, just jokingly, played a 
trick on the poor old army man. O n e of the m e n in the restau-
rant shouted, "Attention!" and the m a n dropped the bucket and 
stood in the position of attention. 
It had been twenty-five years since he had gone through the 
training. But the training had gone into the bones, into the 
blood, into the marrow; it had become part of the unconscious. 
He completely forgot what he was doing—it happened almost 
autonomously, mechanically. 
41

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
42 
He was very angry. But those people said, "Your anger is 
n o t right, because we can call out any w o r d we want. W h o is 
telling you to follow it?" 
He said, "It is too late for me to decide whether to follow it 
or not to follow it. My whole m i n d functions like a machine. 
Those 
twenty-five 
years 
simply 
disappeared. 
Attention 
only 
means attention. You destroyed my eggs, and I am a poor 
m a n . . ." 
But this is being done all over the world. A n d not only today; from 
the very beginning armies have been trained not to use their intelligence 
but to follow orders. 
You have to understand one thing very clearly: To follow an order 
and to understand a thing are two diametrically opposite things. If, by 
understanding, your intelligence feels satisfied and you do something out 
of that, you are not following an order from the outside; you are follow-
ing your o w n intelligence. 
I am reminded of another incident in the First World War. In Berlin, 
a G e r m a n professor of logic was recruited into the army. There was a 
shortage of soldiers, and everybody w h o was physically able was asked to 
volunteer. Otherwise, they were forcing people to j o i n the army. All the 
societies, all the nations, all the cultures, have taken, it for granted that the 
individual exists for them, not vice versa. 
To me, just the opposite is the case: T h e society exists for the indi-
vidual, the culture exists for the individual, the nation exists for the indi-
vidual. Everything else can be sacrificed, but the individual cannot be 
sacrificed for anything. Individuality is the very flowering of existence 
nothing is higher. But no culture, no society, no civilization is ready to 
accept that simple truth. 
T h e professor was forced to volunteer for the army. He said, "I am 
not a m a n w h o can fight. I can argue, I am a logician. If you need some-
body to argue with the enemies I am ready, but fighting is not my busi 
ness. It is barbarous to fight."

What Makes People Stupid 
But nobody listened, and finally he was brought to the parade 
grounds. T h e parade started, and the c o m m a n d e r said, "Left turn." 
Everybody turned left, but the professor remained standing as he was 
standing. 
T h e commander was a little worried: " W h a t is the matter? Perhaps 
the m a n is deaf." So he shouted loudly, " N o w turn to the left again!" All 
the people turned to the left again, but that m a n remained standing as if 
he had not heard anything. Forward, backward . . . all the orders were 
given and everybody followed. That m a n remained just standing in his 
place. 
He was a well-known professor; even the commander knew him. He 
could not be treated just like any other soldier, he inspired a certain re-
spect. Finally, w h e n the parade ended and everybody returned to where 
they had started, the c o m m a n d e r w e n t to the professor and asked, "Is 
there some problem with your ears? Can't you hear?" 
He said, "I can hear." 
"But then," the c o m m a n d e r said, " w h y did you remain standing? 
W h y did you not follow the orders?" 
He said, " W h a t is the point? W h e n everybody finally has to come 
back to the same state, after all this movement going forward and back-
ward, left and right, what have they gained?" 
T h e commander said, "It is not a question of gaining, it is a question 
of training!" 
But he said, "I don't need any training. You come to the same place 
after doing all kinds of stupid things, w h i c h I don't see any point in. C a n 
you explain to me w h y I should turn left and not right?" 
T h e commander said, "Strange, no soldier asks such questions." 
T h e professor said, "I am not a soldier, I am a professor. I have been 
forced to be here, but you cannot force me to do things against my intel-
ligence." 
T h e commander w e n t to the higher authorities and said, " W h a t to do 
with this man? He may ruin the others—because everybody is laughing at 
Me and everybody is saying, 'Professor,you did great!' I cannot tackle that 
43

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
man. He asks such questions, and each thing has to be explained: 'Unless 
I understand it, unless my intelligence supports it, I am not going to do it.'" 
T h e c o m m a n d e r in chief said, "I k n o w the man. He is a great logi-
cian. His w h o l e life's training is in questioning everything. I will take 
care of him, don't be worried." 
He called the professor to his office and said, "I am sorry, but we 
cannot do anything. You have been recruited; the country needs soldiers. 
But I will give you some w o r k that will not create any difficulty for you 
and will not create any difficulty for others. You come with me to the 
army mess." 
He took the professor there, and showed h i m a big pile of green peas. 
He told the professor, "Sit down here. You can sort out the big peas on 
one side and the small peas on the other side. In an hour I will come to 
see h o w things are progressing." 
After an h o u r he came back. T h e professor was sitting there and the 
peas were also sitting there, in the same place. He said, " W h a t is the mat-
ter? You have not even started." 
T h e professor said, "For the first and for the last time, I want you all to 
understand that unless you explain to me . . . W h y should I sort out the 
peas? My intelligence feels insulted by you. Am I an idiot, to sort these 
peas? W h a t is the need? Moreover, there are other difficulties. Sitting 
here, I thought that perhaps there could be some need, but there are ques-
tions w h i c h have to be decided: There are peas that are big and there are 
peas that are small, but there are peas of many other sizes. W h e r e are they 
going to go? You have not given me any criteria." 
Orders, disciplines, guidelines—these have been used by people who 
wanted to dominate you, by people w h o wanted to dictate their terms, to 
enforce their ideas on other people's lives. I call all such people great 
criminals. To impose their ideas on somebody, to enforce some ideal, 
some mold, is violence, sheer violence. T h e y are being destructive.

an's mind is a Pandora's box. 
It contains the w h o l e of evolution from the lowest crea-
ture to the highest genius. They are all living together in 
man's mind simultaneously they are all contemporaries. It is not that 
something is past, something is present, something is future: As far as 
mind is concerned everything is simultaneous, contemporary. 
It has to be understood very clearly 
because without understanding it the ques-
tion of divisive belief systems and fanati-
cism will remain unresolved. T h e idiot is 
in you, and so is the genius. Of course, the 
idiot is m u c h more powerful because it has 
a longer history, and the genius is a very 
still, small voice. From K h o m e i n i to E i n -
stein you are spread; and the trouble is that 
Khomeini is in the majority, m u c h m o r e in 
you than Albert Einstein, w h o is in a very 
poor minority. 
T h i n k of man's m i n d as a pyramid. 
T h e base is made up of Khomeinis, mil-
lions of Khomeiniacs, and as you go u p -
ward there are fewer and fewer people. At 
the peak they are not in millions, n o t in billions, only in dozens—and at 
the very peak, perhaps there is a single individual. 
45

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
46 
But remember that the difference between Khomeini and Einstein is 
not of quality, it is only of quantity, because part of Khomeini is Albert 
Einstein, and the major part of Albert Einstein is also Khomeini. 
Recently the results of a three-year-long study of Albert Einstein's 
brain were published. It took three years just to count the cells of his 
brain. T h e r e are millions of cells in every brain doing different kinds of 
specific work: It is a very miraculous world. 
H o w a certain cell functions in a certain way is still not k n o w n . A 
certain cell thinks, a certain cell dreams, a certain cell poetizes, a certain 
cell paints. W h a t makes the difference between these groups of cells? They 
are all alike as far as chemistry and physiology is concerned; there seems 
to be no difference at all. But there are cells w h i c h think, there are cells 
w h i c h imagine, there are cells w h i c h are mathematical, and there are 
cells w h i c h are philosophical. It is a w h o l e world. 
Three years counting the cells of Albert Einstein's brain—the result 
is very significant. A certain kind of cell has been found in his brain— 
twenty-seven percent more than in the average brain. That certain kind 
of cell has only one function: to feed, nourish, the thinking cells. It has 
no direct function, it is a nourishment to the thinking cells. A n d this 
nourishing cell has been found to be twenty-seven percent m o r e n u m e r -
ous in Einstein than in the ordinary, average man. 
N o w the difference is of quantity, it is not a qualitative difference: 
Those extra twenty-seven percent of cells can be grown in you. And why 
only twenty-seven? Two hundred and seventy percent more can be grown, 
because it is well k n o w n and an established fact h o w those cells grow. 
In white mice they have been growing all kinds of cells. If the white 
mouse is given m o r e things to play with, he starts growing those nour-
ishing cells, because he has to think. If you put h i m in a maze and he has 
to find the way through it—if you put h i m in a box where food is hidden 
somewhere and he has to find the way through all kinds of labyrinths to 
reach the food, and he has to remember the ways that he has followed—-
of course a certain kind of thinking has started. A n d the m o r e he thinks, 
the greater his need for the nourishing cell.

MIND-A PANDORA'S BOX 
Nature provides you whatever you need. Whatever you have is not 
given by any god, by fate; it has been created by your need. But one thing 
out of this whole research is very shocking and shattering: that the differ-
ence between Einstein and K h o m e i n i is only of quantity. A n d that quan-
tity also is not something special, it can be 
created: old Khomeini just has to start 
playing 
chess, 
cards . . . Of 
course 
he 
won't, but if he starts playing chess and 
cards and other things, he will have to 
think. 
Religions kill this very nourishing cell 
because they tell you to believe. Believing 
means: D o n ' t think, don't play with ideas. 
Don't try to find out on your own. Jesus 
has already found it, B u d d h a has already 
said it—why should you be unnecessarily 
concerned? T h e n naturally that part that 
makes a man an Einstein does not develop: 
You remain average. A n d average means 
the basement of humanity. 
Hence, I call man's m i n d a Pandora's 
box. 
And 
for 
another 
reason 
also— 
j 
because whatever has happened in evolu-
tion has left its traces within you. You are still afraid of darkness—that 
fear must be millions of years old; it has nothing to do with the m o d e r n 
world. In fact it is difficult in a place like N e w York to find a dark cor-
ner, everything is so lighted. People may not be enlightened, but places 
are! 
W h y this fear of darkness? Because in m o d e r n life you don't come 
across darkness in any fearful way. If you meet darkness at all it is sooth-
mg, relaxing, rejuvenating. R a t h e r than being afraid of it you should have 
a certain love for it. But the very idea of loving darkness seems absurd. 
Somewhere deep down in your heart is still the caveman w h o was afraid 
Believing means: 
D o n t think, dont 
play with ideas. D o n t 
try to find out on 
your own. Jesus has 
already found it, 
Buddha has already 
said it—why should 
you he unnecessarily 
19 
concerned! 
47

of darkness. T h e fear of darkness comes from those days w h e n ways to 
create fire had not been discovered. Those were the days of darkness, and 
darkness became almost synonymous with evil. Everywhere evil is 
painted as dark, black. Darkness became synonymous with death. Every-
where death is painted as black. 
T h e reason is very clear: Before m a n learned h o w to create fire, night 
was the most dangerous time. If you survived one night you had done 
something really great, because in the night all the wild animals were 
ready to attack you. You could not sleep, you had to remain awake—-just 
the fear of the wild animals was enough to keep you awake. A n d still they 
would attack in darkness, and m a n was helpless. 
So darkness became evil, bad, and synonymous with death. A n d the 
fear has entered so deep in the heart that it remains even today, w h e n 
darkness has gone through a complete transformation . . . Neither do 
wild animals attack you in the dark, n o r does darkness bring any evil or 
death to you. It only brings soothing sleep, takes away all the tiredness of 
the day; makes you again young, alive, full of energy, ready to meet to-
morrow's m o r n i n g sun. But our attitude remains the same. So is the case 
with everything. 
In the past, throughout the w h o l e of evolution, m a n had to become 
part of a certain group, organization, society, tribe, for the simple reason 
that alone, he was so helpless. Alone, and the w h o l e wilderness against 
you—it was difficult to face it. Together, with a crowd, you felt more 
protected, m o r e secure. 
You have to remember that m a n is the most weak and helpless ani-
mal in the world, and because of this helplessness and weakness our 
w h o l e civilization and culture has grown. So don't think of it as a curse; 
it has proved a great, the greatest, blessing. Lions cannot create a society, 
lions cannot create culture because a lion has no need of the group. He 
alone is powerful enough. Sheep move in groups; lions don't move in 
groups. Each lion has its o w n territorial imperative. They have a specific 
technique to declare their territory. All the animals have it—they piss on 
a certain area and its smell makes others aware that this is the boundary

MIND-A PANDORA'S BOX 
line the fence. Outside it, everything is okay; just a single step inside the 
territory and there is danger. 
Lions like to be alone for the simple reason that they are enough for 
any enemy N o w if you think about m a n . . . his body is not so strong as 
that of an animal. His nails are not so strong that he can kill any animal 
just with his nails. His teeth are not so strong that he can eat the raw meat 
of an animal killed with his o w n hands. Neither can he kill with his 
hands nor can he eat raw meat directly with his teeth. All his limbs are 
weaker than those of other animals. He cannot r u n with a horse or with 
a dog, or with a bull, or with a wolf, or with a deer—he is just a nobody! 
It is good that these people don't participate in your Olympic races; o t h -
erwise your great runners w o u l d just look silly. You cannot move like 
monkeys from one tree to another. T h e y go on j u m p i n g from one tree to 
another tree for miles; they need not touch the ground. You cannot fight 
even with a monkey. 
It has to be accepted that m a n is the weakest animal on the earth. 
A n d this is the foundation of his w h o l e behavior, his commitments, his 
groupings. He has to be part of something bigger than himself; only then 
does he feel safe. 
He had to invent all kinds of weapons. No animal has bothered to 
invent weapons. There is no need; their hands, their teeth, their nails, are 
enough. From the earliest days m a n had to invent weapons—first made 
of stones, rocks, then slowly with metals. T h e n he had to admit that even 
with a weapon in his hand he could n o t fight w i t h a lion or an animal 
at close quarters. He had to invent arrows—that is, shooting from a 
distance—because coming close was dangerous. You may have a w e a p o n 
but it won't be of m u c h use against an elephant. He will take you and 
your weapon both together and throw you half a mile away. Shooting 
from a distance in some way or other became necessary. 
That's h o w we have arrived at nuclear weapons. N o w we have taken 
the m a n completely out of it; you just push a button and a rocket shoots. 
You need not k n o w where the rocket is; it goes on its programmed 
course. It will reach the Kremlin or it will reach the W h i t e House; that 
49

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
program is inbuilt. W h o pushes the button does not matter; he can be 
miles away. He has to be miles away because after all the m a n is n o t a 
pope, he is fallible: Things can backfire. T h e rockets may be somewhere 
in Texas and the buttons, the switches, may be somewhere in the W h i t e 
House. 
M a n has created distance between himself and the enemy, and finally 
he had to create distance between himself and the w e a p o n too, because 
the w e a p o n became too dangerous. To keep it close is taking an unneces-
sary risk. 
But everything has grown in a very logical way. M a n has become the 
conqueror of all the animals. O n l y in this 
sense can it be said, "Blessed are the meek 
for they shall inherit the k i n g d o m of the 
earth." They have inherited it only in this 
sense, but in 
no 
other, spiritual sense. 
Man's weakness has proved his strength. 
M a n had to think, he had to work 
things out. There were so many problems 
and he had no natural way to find out 
solutions—hence, thinking. T h i n k i n g sim-
ply means you are faced with a problem 
and nature has not given you the clue to it. 
All the animals are provided with clues. 
They never face any problem. Whenever 
they have to encounter something, they 
k n o w exactly what they have to do; hence 
thinking does not grow. 
M a n was left 
without any solutions, with immense prob-
lems surrounding h i m — h e had to think. 
O v e r millions of years his thinking 
cells became more and m o r e efficient. But 
along the way he was gathering all kinds of dust, all kinds of fears. 
It was necessary, it could not be avoided; but the trouble is that time 
50

MIND-A PANDORA'S BOX 
has passed, you have passed through that way, but the dust is still clinging 
to you. 
N o w man can be alone. N o w there is no need for h i m to be fanatically 
committed to any religious group, any political ideology—Christianity, 
Hinduism, Mohammedanism, communism, fascism—there is no need. But 
the majority consists of idiots. They go on reliving their past again and 
again. It is said that history repeats itself—that is true as far as ninety-nine 
percent of humanity is concerned; it can't be otherwise. It has to repeat it-
self because these people go on chnging to their past, and they go on doing 
the same things again and again. 
They cluster in groups—and this has to be a commitment, because 
otherwise why should the group take on the burden of including you? 
You have to pay something in return. W h y should the group bother 
about your safety? You have to do something for the group—that is your 
commitment. You say, "I am ready to die for you. If you are ready to die 
for me, I am ready to die for you." It is a simple bargain. 
And why are they fanatically committed? T h e y have to be fanatically 
committed because if they start being conscious, alert, they will see what 
an idiotic thing it is. 
There is no need to belong to Adolf Hitler's Nazi party. But a c o u n -
try like G e r m a n y — o n e of the most educated, cultured, sophisticated; the 
country that has given the longest list of thinkers and philosophers to the 
world—falls victim to an utter idiot. A n d a m a n like Martin Heidegger, 
one of the most important philosophers of his age, perhaps the most i m -
portant, was a follower of Adolf Hitler. O n e cannot believe it. It is sim-
ply inconceivable that a m a n like Martin Heidegger, w h o has no 
comparison anywhere in the world . , . all of his contemporaries look 
like pygmies in comparison. Heidegger's thinking was so complex that 
he could never finish any of his books. He would start, he would write 
the first part, and then the w h o l e world would be waiting for the second 
part to appear. A n d it would never appear for the simple reason that by 
me end of the first part he had created so many problems for himself that 
now he did not k n o w where to move, where to go, w h a t to do, or h o w to 
51

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
52 
resolve it all. He simply kept silent and started another book! 
A n d that's what he did his w h o l e life. T h e first part appears, then the 
second part, the third part, is missing, no b o o k is complete. But even 
those incomplete pieces are simply miracles of the mind. T h e fineness of 
his logic and the depth of his approach. . . . But even this m a n could not 
see that Adolf Hitler was a madman. He was also fanatically committed 
to Adolf Hitler. 
From where does this urge to be fanatically committed come? 
It comes from your doubt. You cannot really convince yourself that 
w h a t you are doing is right, so you have to overdo it. You have to shout 
loudly so that you can hear; you have to convince others so that in turn 
you can be convinced. You have to convert others, so that seeing you 
have converted thousands of people you are at ease: There must be some 
truth in w h a t you are saying; otherwise, w h y are so many people con-
vinced? You can be a fool, but so many people can't be foolish. 
Just think of Adolf Hitler: He can think of himself as a fool, but 
what about Martin Heidegger? He has convinced Martin Heidegger; 
n o w no other proof is needed. This m a n is proof enough that w h a t he is 
saying is right. This is a reciprocal process, a vicious circle. You become 
m o r e convinced by having m o r e fanatically committed people around 
you, and because you become m o r e convinced you start gathering more 
people around you. 
Adolf Hitler says in his autobiography that it does not matter what 
you are saying—whether it is right or wrong, true or false—just go on 
repeating it with conviction. N o b o d y is bothered about its rationality 
and logic. H o w many people in the world understand what logic is, what 
rationality is? Just go on repeating yourself with force, with emphasis. 
Those people are in search of conviction, not in search of truth. T h e y are 
in search of somebody w h o knows it. A n d h o w can they feel that you 
k n o w it if you say if and but, perhaps . . .? 
That's w h y the Jain mystic Mahavira could not gather many follow-
ers in India—because he started every one of his statements with perhaps-
He was right, he was absolutely correct—but that is n o t the way to find

MIND-A PANDORA'S BOX 
followers. Even those w h o were following by and by disappeared: 
"Perhaps. . . this m a n is talking about 'perhaps'? Perhaps there is a G o d ? " 
Can you gather a following committed to your perhaps? They want cer-
tainty they want a guarantee. Mahavira was too wise a m a n for all those 
idiots He behaved with people as if they were capable of the same level 
of understanding he had. 
W h a t he was saying would be understood by Albert Einstein, because 
what Albert Einstein says is also with a perhaps. That's the w h o l e meaning 
of the theory of relativity: N o t h i n g can be said with certainty because 
everything is only relative, nothing is certain. C a n you say this is light? It 
is only relative. In comparison to a brighter light it may look very dim. 
In comparison to a light that is a million times brighter, it may look like 
just a black hole, just a darkness. W h a t is darkness? Less light. T h e r e are 
animals, cats, moving in the house in the night perfectly well. In your 
house, even somebody else's cat can move better than you can move in 
the darkness. You will stumble, but the cat has eyes that can catch d i m m e r 
rays of light. 
T h e owl only sees in the night; the day is too bright. T h e owl needs 
sunglasses; without sunglasses he cannot see, the day is too bright. W h e n 
it is morning to you, it is evening to the owl. N o w what is what? T h i n k 
of the owl, then you will understand the meaning of perhaps—perhaps it 
is evening; as far as the owl is concerned perhaps it is m o r n i n g . As the 
night grows darker, the owl sees better. In the middle of the night it is the 
middle of the day for the owl. 
Things are relative; hence to say anything with certainty is to show 
your stupidity. That's w h y Mahavira used a strange approach for the first 
time in the history of man, twenty-five centuries before Albert Einstein. 
His word for perhaps is syat. His philosophy became k n o w n as syatvad, 
the philosophy of perhaps." You could ask any question; he w o u l d never 
answer you with certainty. You might have come with some certainty; by 
the time you left h i m you would be m o r e uncertain. Now, w h o wants to 
follow such a man? 
Adolf Hitler is going to be followed because he takes uncertainty, 
53

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
54 
which was like a w o u n d , out of you. You are trembling inside; you don't 
k n o w w h a t this life is all about. But somebody knows, and you can follow 
that somebody. You are relieved of a great burden of uncertainty. All that 
is needed from your side is a fanatical belief. 
T h e fanatical belief serves both sides. T h e leader needs it because he 
himself is just like you, trembling deep inside; he knows nothing. All he 
knows is that he can shout better than you, that he is m o r e articulate than 
you, that he at least can pose as if he knows—that he is a good actor, a 
very refined hypocrite. But deep d o w n he knows that he is trembling. He 
needs a great following, which will help h i m to get rid of his fear, which 
will convince h i m that he knows. 
I have heard that it happened that a journalist died and reached the 
gates of paradise. Journalists are not supposed to go there; h o w it hap-
pened I don't know. T h e gatekeeper looked at h i m and said, "Are you a 
journalist?" 
He said, " O f course, and as a press reporter I am allowed every-
where. Let me in." 
T h e gatekeeper said, "There is a difficulty. In the first place, in para-
dise we don't have any newspaper because no news happens h e r e — n o 
crime, no drunkards, no rape. There are only saints, dried up, frozen from 
eternity till eternity. So what news is there? Still, we have a quota of ten 
journalists, but that has been full from the very beginning. You will have 
to go to the other gate on the other side of the road." 
T h e journalist said, " C a n y o u do a little favor for me? I will leave af-
ter twenty-four hours, but just give me a chance, at least a tour. If you 
cannot allow me a permanent, residential green card, you can let me have 
a twenty-four-hour tour. That is not too m u c h to ask. Since I come from 
so far away, have mercy on me. A n d give me one promise: If I can con-
vince one of those ten journalists to go to hell in my place, then will you 
let me stay here?" 
T h e gatekeeper said, " N o problem. If you can convince somebody 
to go to the other place, you can be in his place. It makes no difference to 
us; the quota is ten."

M i n d - A 
P a n d o r a s 
B o x 
T h e man said, " T h e n just give me twenty-four hours." 
He went in and he started talking to everybody, w h o m e v e r he met. 
"Have you heard that in hell they are going to start a n e w daily newspa-
per the biggest that has ever been tried? A n d they are in need of a chief 
editor, editorial staff, and all kinds of journalists. Weekly editors, and lit-
erary editors. . . haven't you heard?" 
T h e others said, " W e have not heard anything, but that is great. In 
this rotten place, only one issue of a newspaper was published, way back 
in the beginning of time, but since then nothing has happened. So we go 
on reading the first issue again and again, what else to do? This n e w pa-
per sounds great!" All ten journalists became agitated. T h e next day, after 
twenty-four hours, the journalist w e n t back to the gate. T h e gatekeeper 
immediately closed the door and said, " R e m a i n inside!" 
He said, " W h y ? " 
T h e gatekeeper said, "You are a tricky fellow. All those ten have es-
caped to the other place, n o w I cannot allow you to go. At least one j o u r -
nalist should be here." 
T h e journalist said, "But I cannot remain here! You have to let me 
go!" 
T h e gatekeeper said, "Are you mad? You spread that rumor, w h i c h is 
absolutely false. They got the idea that they will get great jobs in hell, and 
became excited—but w h y are you wanting to go?" 
He said, " W h o knows, there may be something in it. I cannot stay 
here and miss it. You cannot stop me anyway because I am not supposed 
to be here; I am only a tourist for twenty-four hours. R e m e m b e r , that 
was our basic decision—that for twenty-four hours I will be in, and then 
I will go out. You cannot stop m e — y o u cannot go against your word." 
But the gatekeeper tried hard: "You have spread the rumor; it is ab-
solutely false. A n d d o n 't bring trouble on me because the hierarchy, the 
bureaucracy, will ask me, W h e r e are all the ten journalists?' O n c e in a 
while they take the census and they'll say, ' N o t a single journalist? T h e 
whole quota is missing? W h e r e have they gone?' 
At least I can show the hierarchy the m a n w h o convinced them; 
55

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
56 
and they escaped. A n d because it has never happened before—anybody 
escaping from paradise into hell—we don't keep the doors closed from 
the inside. N o b o d y ever escapes; anybody can open t h e m and look out, 
there is no problem. W h o is going to w a n t to go to hell? A n d there is 
no third place. So the doors were open as always, and they escaped. They 
simply said to me, 'Good-bye, we are not c o m i n g back again.' I cannot 
let you go." 
But the journalist was stubborn. He said, " T h e n I will go immedi-
ately to the hierarchy and expose the w h o l e thing: that I am not entitled 
to be here, I don't have a green card—I am just a tourist—and the gate-
keeper is not allowing me to go out. You have committed two crimes: 
first, you allowed me in; second, you are not allowing me out." 
T h e gatekeeper understood; that was perfectly right. He said, "Okay, 
you go. T h e census, it takes eternity—everything takes eternity here. 
Meanwhile maybe some other journalist may turn up. But this is strange, 
that you are convinced by a r u m o r that you created yourself." 
He said, " W h e n ten other journalists believe it, there must be some-
thing in it. Some part of it must be true; otherwise h o w can you con-
vince ten journalists to go from paradise to hell? There is b o u n d to be 
some truth in it." 
T h e leader is continuously in need of being convinced again and 
again that what he is saying is right. For that he needs growing numbers 
of committed people. A n d the m o r e fanatically they are committed, the 
m o r e convincing they are to him. If they are ready to die or to kill, to go 
on a crusade, do jihad, holy war—that makes h i m certain. 
A n d in a circular way, his certainty convinces the followers—because 
he becomes louder, m o r e stubborn; he becomes absolutely certain. Ifs and 
buts disappear from his language—whatever he says is the truth. A n d this 
vicious circle goes on and on. It makes the leader fanatic and the follow-
ers fanatics. It is the psychological need of both; b o t h are in the same 
boat. 
People have a psychological need to feel certain. To have shifting 
sand continuously underneath their feet makes their life difficult. It is

Mind-A Pandoras Box 
difficult enough as it is—and then all around, uncertainty and insecurity, 
all around, problems and no answers. This gives an opportunity to those 
few cunning people w h o can pretend that 
they deal exactly in the commodities you 
need. T h e only quality the leader needs is 
that he should always be ahead of the 
crowd. He should be constantly watchful 
of where the crowd is going, and be ahead 
of it. That keeps the crowd feeling that the 
leader is leading. 
T h e leader only has to be this clever, 
that he goes on watching the m o o d of the 
people, where they are moving. Wherever 
the wind starts blowing the real leader 
never misses the chance: He is always ahead 
of the crowd. 
Thinkers are n o t needed because a 
thinker will start wondering whether the 
way the crowd is going is the right course, 
or whether the way he was going is the 
right course. If he starts thinking in that 
way then he will not be the leader any 
longer, he will be alone. T h e crowd will have moved with some idiot 
w h o does not bother to w o n d e r about w h e r e they are going. You may be 
going to hell, but he is the leader—he is ahead of you. T h e only quality 
in the leader that is needed is a faculty that can judge the m o o d of the 
crowd. This is not very difficult because the crowd is shouting loudly 
what it wants all the time, w h e r e it wants to go, what its needs are. You 
have just to be a little alert and put all these voices together; then there 
will be no problem, you will be ahead of the crowd. 
And go on promising whatever they are asking for—nobody will ex-
pect you to fulfill your promises, they are asking only to be promised. 
W h o has asked you to fulfill your promises? Go on giving promises and 
57

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
don't be worried that some day they will catch hold of you and ask about 
them. They never will, because whenever they catch hold of you, you can 
give t h e m bigger promises. 
And people's memories are very short. W h a t you promised five years 
ago, w h o remembers? In five years' time so m u c h water has gone down the 
Ganges, w h o bothers? In five years so much 
has changed. D o n ' t be worried, you just go 
on making bigger and bigger promises. 
A n d people believe in those promises, 
people want to believe. T h e y have nothing 
else, just hopes. So the leaders go on giving 
opium, hope, and people become addicted. 
Fanatic c o m m i t m e n t to groups and 
organizations, political, religious, or any 
other kind, is a kind of addiction—just like 
any other drug. A Christian feels at h o m e 
surrounded by Christians. That is addic-
tion, a psychological drug. Seeing a person 
outside of their crowd, something in the 
psyche of people immediately starts trem-
bling: a question mark has arisen. There is a m a n w h o does not believe in 
Christ: "It is possible not to believe in Christ? It is possible to survive 
without believing in Christ?" Suspicions, doubts . . . 
W h y do they get angry? T h e y are n o t angry, they are really afraid. 
A n d to hide the fear they have to project the anger. Anger is always to 
hide fear. 
People use all kinds of strategies. There are people w h o will laugh 
just so that they can stop their tears. In laughing you will forget, they will 
forget. . . and the tears can remain hidden. In anger, their fear remains 
hidden. 
T h e y are very fanatic, defensive . . . T h e y k n o w their belief is not 
their experience, and they are afraid some outsider may scratch, may dig 
deep, may bring the w o u n d in front of their eyes. S o m e h o w they have 
58

Mind-A Pandoras Box 
been able to cover it u p — t h e y are Christians and Christ is the savior, the 
only savior, the only real savior, and they have the H o l y B o o k and G o d is 
with them so what is there to fear? T h e y have created a cozy psycholog-
ical h o m e and suddenly, like a bull in a china shop, in comes a stranger 
who doesn't believe as they do! 
O n e of my teachers loved me very m u c h . In my high school days he 
was the one teacher with w h o m I was very intimate. So after I went to 
university, and came back to my h o m e t o w n on holidays, I would go to 
see him. 
He said one day, "I wait for you. It is very strange that I wait for you, 
knowing that n o w the holidays are here and you will be coming. A n d 
your coming is just like a fresh breeze. In my old age you remind me 
again of my youth and my youthful dreams. But w h e n you come, I b e -
come afraid and I start praying to God: 'Let h i m go as soon as possible!' 
Because you create suspicion in me; you are my greatest doubt. Just see-
ing you is enough for all my doubts to start arising. S o m e h o w I keep 
them down, but with you it is difficult." 
He said, "It is strange that just your coming into my house is enough 
and all my efforts at repression fail and all my doubts stand up. I k n o w 
that I don't k n o w God, and I k n o w that my prayers are just futile—there 
is nobody to hear them. Still I go on doing them three times a day: 
morning, afternoon, evening. But w h e n you are here then I cannot do 
my prayers as peacefully as I do every other day." 
I said, "But I never disturb your prayers!" 
He said, "It is not that you disturb them. But if you are just sitting 
here and I am doing my prayer . . . it is impossible. Suddenly I k n o w that 
what I am doing is stupid and I k n o w what you are thinking. You must 
be thinking that this old fool still goes on doing the same thing . . . I 
know that in your eyes this is not intelligent, what I am doing. A n d the 
trouble is, that deep d o w n I agree with you. But n o w I am too old and I 
cannot change. Fear arises. I cannot stop. M a n y times I have thought, 
W h y don't I stop praying? But I have been praying for seventy-five 
Years . . ." 
59

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
At that time he must have been about ninety-two. "I have been pray-
ing for so long. A n d now, at the time of death, to stop? A n d w h o 
knows? . . . If this boy is around and G o d really does exist, then I will be 
in a fix: I will not be able even to raise my eyes before G o d if at the last 
m o m e n t I dropped praying. So I think, n o w that I have done it all my 
life, let me continue, right or wrong. If it is wrong, nothing is lost. Any-
way, n o w that I am retired, the whole day I am free. A n d if G o d is there, 
then it is perfectly g o o d — m y prayers have succeeded." 
I said, "This w o n ' t help. Even if G o d is there, this kind of prayer is 
futile. Do you think you can deceive God? W o n ' t he ask you? You were 
praying w i t h this idea that if he does not exist, good, and if he exists, 
you can say that at least you prayed to him. You think you can deceive 
G o d ? " 
He said, "This is the trouble. That's w h y I say to you, please don't 
come! I cannot drop it, and I cannot do it sincerely. A n d n o w you have 
created a third problem: Even if I am doing it, it is useless! Because you 
are right: If G o d is there he will k n o w this simple thing, that this old man 
is trying to deceive him." 
I said, "This is far worse than not praying. At least be honest. A n d I 
don't think being honest is anything against religion. Just be honest; if 
you don't feel it, drop it!" 
He said, " W i t h you I again start feeling young, strong. But w h e n you 
are gone I am again old, death is close by, and this is not the time to 
change boats. O n e may fall into the water. It is better to keep on with 
what you are doing . . . whatever is going to happen, let it happen. Just 
continue. A n d I am n o t alone; two hundred million Hindus are with me. 
That's the point, two hundred million Hindus are with me." 
I said, "Yes, that's true. Two hundred million Hindus are with you 
and I am alone. But a single person can destroy your t w o hundred mil-
lion Hindus' support, if it is based on a lie. You have taken a wrong 
step—you should never have listened to me!" 
That's what fanaticism is: D o n ' t listen to anything that goes against 
you. Before anybody says something you start shouting so loudly that you 
60

M i n d A P a n d o r a 
s 
B o x 
: 
hear only your o w n voice. R e a d only your o w n book, listen only to your 
church, to your temple, to your synagogue. 
Fanaticism is simply a strategy to protect you from doubts. But al-
though doubts can be protected, they cannot be destroyed. A n d n o w 
there is no need either. M a n has passed through those stages where he 
needed crowds. N o w he can be an individual. That does not mean that 
you don't have clubs, you don't have societies, but there is no need to be 
committed fanatically. 
You can be a Rotarian; that does not mean you are committed fanat-
ically, that you will die for the R o t a r y Club. 
That will be a really great m a r t y r d o m — 
somebody dying for the R o t a r y Club! You 
don't have to die for the R o t a r y Club, 
Lions' 
Club . . . you 
need n o t die for 
Christianity, M o h a m m e d a n i s m , Hinduism, 
communism, socialism. You can have a 
rapport with people, you can have a dia-
logue with people. You can have meetings 
with people, you can c o m m u n e with p e o -
ple w h o are of the same mind, but there is 
no need to make any fuss about it. No 
crusade, no holy war . . . 
Yes, you 
can remain a nation but 
there is no need to make too m u c h of those 
boundaries that you have created on the 
map. T h e y are only on the map, don't start 
seeing t h e m on the ground. That's where 
you become blind. 
It is perfectly good there should be so 
many nations but there is no need for so 
many madnesses. It is perfectly good, people 
can worship in their o w n ways, pray in their own ways, have their o w n 
book, love their o w n messiahs, there is no problem about it. But don't

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
62 
make it a problem for other h u m a n beings. It is your personal thing. You 
like something, you prefer a certain perfume—perfectly good; if some-
body else does not like it, it does not make h i m your enemy. These are 
preferences—somebody can differ. A n d differing does not mean antago-
nism, it simply means one has a different way of looking at things, feeling 
things. 
There is no need for any fanaticism, there is no need for any c o m -
mitment. If we can have organizations in the world without c o m m i t -
ment, without fanaticism, it will be a beautiful world. Organizations 
themselves are n o t bad. Organizations without commitment, without fa-
natic attitudes, simply make an orderly world. A n d order is certainly 
needed. W h e r e there are so many millions of people you cannot live 
without order. 
I have called that order a " c o m m u n e . " I have called it " c o m m u n e " 
just to make it different from organization, political party, religious cult. I 
have called it simply " c o m m u n e , " where people of similar vision live in 
a friendliness, with all their differences. 
T h e y are not to erase their differences to be part of the c o m m u n e , 
that becomes c o m m i t m e n t . Their differences are accepted, those are the 
qualities of those individuals. 
A n d it is in fact making the c o m m u n e rich w h e n so many people 
with so many different qualities, talents, creativities, sensitivities, are 
joined without crippling each other, without destroying each other. On 
the contrary, they are helping each other to become a perfect individual, 
a unique individual . . . 
STEPPING O U T OF THE PYRAMID 
A question: I was shocked to hear you say that the pyramid of human-
ity consists of Ayatollah Khomeini and Albert Einstein, and there is no 
qualitative difference between the two. Isn't there a third alternative?

Mind A Pandora's Box 
I am shocked too, but one is helpless against the reality. T h e truth is 
that there is no qualitative difference between Ayatollah Khomeini and 
Albert Einstein; I would have loved to declare it if there was even a small 
possibility of some qualitative difference. That does not mean that b o t h 
are the same type of person. 
Ayatollah K h o m e i n i is a m a d m a n . Albert Einstein is a genius, the 
sharpest intelligence humanity has ever produced. So I am not saying that 
they are the same kind of people, but w h a t can I do? T h e y belong to 
the same range. T h e Ayatollah is the lowest in the line, Albert Einstein the 
highest, but the difference is only of degrees; it is the same pyramid. 
Ayatollah Khomeini, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, 
M a o T s e - t u n g — t h e y are as h u m a n as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, 
Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Jaspers; they belong to one humanity, to one mind. 
But Ayatollah K h o m e i n i and his company are sick. T h e m i n d is the same 
but it is a sick mind, it is upside down. Albert Einstein and Bertrand 
Russell are healthy. It is the same m i n d but in the right shape; it is as it 
should be. 
But I cannot say that they belong to two different categories; that 
would be a lie. It would be consoling—you would not be shocked, I 
would not be shocked, everybody would be happy. But to destroy truth 
for such stupid consolation is n o t going to help anybody. 
But w h y do you look only from one side? There are m a n y aspects 
which have to be considered. W h y don't you see it as a great revelation? 
You have thought only of one thing, that's w h y you got shocked. I got 
shocked too, but I also got excited, ecstatic. 
You thought only of one thing, that Albert Einstein is reduced to the 
level of Ayatollah Khomeini. But w h y can't you see the other possibility— 
that Ayatollah Khomeini can be raised to the level of Albert Einstein? 
I am opening a tremendous possibility for these mad people. A n d 
these mad people have dominated humanity; something has to be done. 
Humanity as such is n o t bad, not evil, but one Ayatollah K h o m e i n i can 
drive a w h o l e country crazy, idiotic. 
63

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
T h e names, the words, the principles these people use to hide their 
madness and stupidity are beautiful. Ayatollah K h o m e i n i recites the holy 
Koran every day. He does not need to read; he has memorized it—the 
whole holy Koran. He quotes continuously from the holy Koran, and 
those w h o are listening to h i m and following h i m believe that he is a 
prophet, a messenger of G o d sent to help Islam succeed. That's what all 
the religions believe: If they succeed, only then is there any future for h u -
manity; otherwise there is no future, m a n is finished. A n d what he is d o -
ing is so barbarous, so ugly, so i n h u m a n . . . People are being slaughtered 
continuously, beheaded continuously. People are being beaten to death 
on the crossroads before thousands of spectators—and all those spectators 
are rejoicing because this is the success of Islam. 
Ayatollah K h o m e i n i says that anything done according to the Islamic 
principles is right. There is no other way, no other criterion to decide 
right and wrong. To behead a m a n is Islamic. If the m a n is not willing to 
become a M o h a m m e d a n then it is better he should die. Living as a n o n -
M o h a m m e d a n is worse than dying, because death may change his life 
pattern. Perhaps in this body, in this mind, he is incapable of becoming a 
M o h a m m e d a n , so this body and mind have to be destroyed. These are 
hindrances to his salvation. A n d to die by the hands of Islamic soldiers is 
a glory in itself. You should be proud: You attained a great death. You 
could not attain a great life but you attained a great death. So the person 
w h o is being killed by the Islamic murderers is fortunate. A n d the people 
w h o are killing h i m are also earning great virtue, because there is no 
other motive—they are trying to help the man, to transform his being. 
T h e y are making the way to G o d clear and clean for the person. They 
are doing God's work: They will be b o r n as saints in paradise. So b o t h are 
benefited. H o w can something be w r o n g and evil w h e n both parties are 
immensely benefited, spiritually benefited? 
Do you see the cunningness of people? But this Ayatollah has the same 
mind as you have, it is just that it has gone nuts. But it can be repaired. 
This is happening all over the world . . . Just the other day in the 
Vatican one w o m a n j u m p e d from St. Peter's basilica—the highest church 
64

Mind A Pandora's Box 
in C h r i s t e n d o m — a n d killed herself. N o b o d y knows why, and perhaps 
nobody will ever k n o w why. But w h e n I heard this, the immediate re-
sponse that came to me was that this w o m a n has declared something sig-
nificant. T h e whole of humanity is going to die in the Vatican, j u m p i n g 
from St. Peter's basilica. This w o m a n is a pioneer. She has simply said 
that this is going to happen to the w h o l e of humanity. A n d they are d o -
ing everything—the pope, the cardinals, the bishops, the priests—to e n -
courage this to happen. 
A 
very 
respected 
humanitarian, a 
Catholic 
nun, Sister Judith 
Vaughan, was expelled from the Catholic church. In California she was 
running a shelter for poor w o m e n , abandoned w o m e n , rejected w o m e n . 
And she helped thousands of w o m e n . But all her life's w o r k is nothing; 
she just committed a small mistake, a mistake in the eyes of the Christian 
bureaucracy. She signed a newspaper advertisement in favor of abortion 
rights. T h e newspaper had asked those w h o were in favor to sign and 
send the advertisement back to the newspaper, so they could say that n o t 
all Christians are against the right to abortion. Sister Judith signed i t — 
and that is a great sin. 
T h e w o m a n worked her w h o l e life, served thousands of w o m e n , was 
respected all over California, and she understands the problems of 
women—abortion, children, orphans—more than those idiots w h o e x -
pelled her from the church. N o t only did they expell her from the 
church, they prevented her from entering the shelter that she created for 
poor w o m e n , for suffering w o m e n . She was not allowed to enter the 
church or the shelter, and she is no longer a nun. N o b o d y cares that what 
she was doing was humanitarian. 
M o r e population means m o r e problems—and you are n o t able to 
solve the problems that are present. Each child brings thousands of p r o b -
lems with him. Already m o r e people have arrived on the earth than the 
earth can support. Even countries like America have problems w h i c h 
should have disappeared from the world long before—what to say about 
the third world, the poor world? Africa, Latin America, Asia—what to say 
of those countries? 
65

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
66 
In America there are millions and millions of illiterate adults. In the 
richest country of the world—technologically, scientifically, culturally, in 
every way at the top—millions of adults are still uneducated, they can't 
read a newspaper. A n d you go on bringing m o r e people? You cannot 
even solve simple problems—and there are complicated problems. 
In a gas explosion in Bhopal thousands of people died. All the 
w o m e n that were pregnant and did not die then started giving birth to 
children. Thousands of children were coming out of the w o m b dead or 
crippled or blind or retarded. A few w h i c h were b o r n alive died within 
six weeks. T h e physicians and the scientists did not think that the gas was 
going to affect the fetus so severely. A n d this was only a small explosion. 
W h e n your nuclear explosions and atomic explosions start happening, 
h o w they are going to affect you is unimaginable. A n d it will not affect 
only you; it will affect all the generations that follow you. It will affect 
the w h o l e future of humanity. 
W h o is creating these problems? T h e mind. T h e same m i n d can 
solve them. 
So w h e n I say Ayatollah Khomeini and Albert Einstein belong to the 
same line . . . if you think that Albert Einstein is also like Ayatollah 
Khomeini you will get only a shock. But if you also think that Ayatollah 
Khomeini has the capacity to be an Albert Einstein then you will be ex-
cited like me. 
But I have talked only about the pyramid of the mind. I have not 
talked about people w h o have dropped out of the mind, I have not talked 
about the meditators. T h e y are qualitatively different from both. 
A m a n of meditation is as far away from Ayatollah K h o m e i n i as he is 
from Albert Einstein, because he is far away from m i n d itself. 
T h e pyramid is only of people living in the mind, so don't be d e -
pressed. You can j u m p out of the pyramid; n o b o d y is forcing you to be in 
it. It is your decision to be in it or not to be in it. You can b e c o m e a 
watcher. You stand outside the pyramid and watch the w h o l e stupid game 
that goes on. 
I am not part of the pyramid. That's w h y I can talk about the pyramid,

Mind A Pandora's Box 
describe it in total detail from all aspects, because I am just a watcher. I 
can move around the pyramid, I can see all its faces. I can see its lowest 
depth, I can see its highest peak—because I am not in it. 
If you are in it, then it is impossible for you to watch it in its totality; 
you have to be outside of it. A n d there have been such people d o w n the 
ages—very few, but that does not make 
any difference: Even if a single person can 
escape from the pyramid that is enough to 
prove the possibility. A n d many have es-
caped from it. 
Just a little effort on your side, a little 
alertness, and you can slip out of the m i n d — 
because the pyramid is not made of s o m e -
thing solid; the bricks it is m a d e out of 
are thoughts. You are surrounded by a wall 
of thoughts. It is so easy to come out of it. 
You don't even have to dig a hole in the 
wall, you don't even have to open a door. 
You have simply to stand silently and see 
whether the wall really exists or only ap-
pears to. 
In the East they call it a mirage; it only 
appears real. T h e closer you come to it, 
and the better you look at it, the m o r e it 
starts disappearing. Thoughts are the most 
insubstantial 
things 
in 
the 
world; they 
don't have anything material in them. 
Your thoughts are just like ghosts. You 
simply go on believing in them, never trying to have an encounter, never turning yourself
at them. You will be simply surprised that any thought that you stare at 
simply melts away. It cannot stand your watchfulness. 
So there is a third alternative. You need not be either Ayatollah 
67

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
Khomeiniac or Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein is a good man, but good 
and bad are two sides of the same coin. Saint and sinner are two sides of 
the same coin; heaven and hell, G o d and devil—two sides of the same 
coin. Neither can exist without the other. 
But there is a third alternative—you need not be either—and that's 
really to be yourself. 
To be out of the pyramid of the m i n d is to enter into the temple of 
your being. 
T h e pyramid is for the dead. Actually the pyramids were made as 
graves for Egyptian kings and queens. They are graveyards; and w h e n I 
used the w o r d pyramid for the m i n d I used it knowingly. M i n d is also a 
graveyard of dead things, past memories, experiences, shadows . . . all 
shadows. But by and by they become so thick that they create a dark cur-
tain around you. 
If you want to escape from your shadow, what do you think you have 
to do? R u n ? T h e shadow will follow you wherever you go, it will be 
with you; it is your shadow. A n d a shadow is nonexistential; it is a ghost. 
T h e only way to get rid of it is to turn back and look at it and try to find 
whether there is any substance in it. There is nothing! It is pure negativ-
ity. It is just because you are standing in the way of the sun rays that the 
sun rays cannot come in; and the absence of sun creates the shadow. 
Exactly this is the situation about your thoughts. Because you are not 
watchful, because you are not silent, because you can't see things clearly 
without any disturbance, thoughts are substitutes for awareness. Unless 
you become aware, thoughts will continue. 
T h e m i n d is not you; it is somebody else: You are only a watcher. 
A n d just a few glimpses of watching will prepare you to get out of the 
pyramid without any fighting, without any struggle, without any prac-
tice. You simply stand up and get out. 
People go on believing in anything that is consolatory. Their ghosts, 
their gods, their heaven and hell—these are all just consolations. Their 
saints, holy men, sages—all consolation. A true m a n needs guts to get out 
of all this rotten mess. A n d the only way to get out of it is to become

Mind A Pandora's Box 
a witness of your o w n thought processes. A n d it is easy, it is the easiest 
thing in the world. You just have to do it once; but you never try even 
once, and you go on thinking it is the most difficult thing. 
I also used to think that it was a very difficult thing, because that's 
what I had been told by everybody, read in every book—that it is such a 
great, difficult p h e n o m e n o n ; it takes lives together for a m a n to come to 
the state of no-mind. W h e n everybody is saying that, and there is not 
even a single exception, it is very natural that you may start believing it. 
But I am a little eccentric. My logic does not follow the ordinary 
course, it goes zigzag. O n c e I became aware that everybody says it is dif-
ficult, every scripture says it is difficult, the first idea that came to me was 
that it is possible that nobody has tried. Otherwise there would be differ-
ent opinions. Somebody would say it is this difficult; somebody would 
say it is m o r e difficult than that; somebody would say it is less difficult 
than that. It is impossible to have unanimous support for its difficulty 
from all over the world. T h e only possibility was that n o b o d y had tried— 
but n o b o d y wants to confess one's ignorance. T h e n the best course is to 
agree with the collective consensus that it is difficult, very difficult; it 
takes lives. 
I dropped that idea. I said, "It has to happen in this life; otherwise I 
will not let it happen in any life, I will struggle against it. Either this life 
or never." " N o w or never" became my fixed approach, and the day I d e -
cided " N o w or never," it happened. Since then I have been simply 
amazed h o w people have been fooled. 
T h e simplest thing has been made the most impossible—and the 
simplest thing opens the door for the third alternative. 
It takes you out of the pyramid: You are no longer a mind. And then 
only do you k n o w w h o you are. And to k n o w it is to have achieved 
everything worth achieving.

W
hen somebody becomes identified with the intellect, intellec-
tuality is born; w h e n somebody remains the master, unidenti-
fied with the intellect, intelligence is b o r n . Intellect is the 
same. T h e whole thing depends on whether you get identified with it or 
you remain transcendental to it. If you b e c o m e identified, it is intellectu-
ality; if you remain unidentified, it is intelligence. 
Intelligence is of tremendous importance; intellectuality is a barrier. 
Intellectuality is a barrier even in the world of science. Intellectuality 
can, at the most, give you scholars, wordy people w h o go on and on, 
spinning and weaving systems of thought with no substance at all. 
In the scientific endeavor, intelligence has to be focused on the o b -
jective world; in the spiritual exploration, intelligence has to move in-
ward. It is the same intelligence, only the direction changes. In science, 
the object, the outer object, is the goal of inquiry; in the spiritual realm 
your subjectivity, your interiority is your adventure. T h e intelligence is 
the same. 
If you b e c o m e an intellectual then you will not be a scientist. You 
will write histories of science or philosophies of science, but you will not 
be a scientist, an explorer, an inventor, a discoverer on your own. You will 
be simply accumulating information. Yes, that too has a certain use; as far 
as the outside world is concerned, even information has a certain limited 
utility. But in the inner world it has no utility at all. It is a barrier; it has 
a negative effect on the inner experience. 
70

FROM MIND TO NO MIND 
T h e intellect is neither a barrier n o r a bridge—intellect is neutral. 
Get identified with it, it becomes a barrier; 
remain unidentified with it, it is a bridge. 
And without meditation you cannot k n o w 
your transcendental nature. 
In science, concentration is enough; at 
the most, contemplation is needed. In the 
inner world, meditation is the only way. 
Concentration is not needed—it is not a 
help, it is a positive hindrance. C o n t e m p l a -
tion also is not a help; it is a compensation 
for not being meditative, it is a poor substi-
tute for it. Meditation—only meditation— 
can bring the inner revolution. 
Meditation means getting out of the 
mind, looking at the m i n d from the out-
side. That's exactly the meaning of the 
word ecstasy: to stand outside. To stand out-
side of the m i n d makes you ecstatic, brings 
bliss to you. A n d great intelligence is re-
leased. W h e n you are identified with the 
mind you cannot be very intelligent b e -
cause you become identified with an instrument, you become confined 
by the instrument and its limitations. A n d you are unlimited—you are 
consciousness. 
Use the mind, but don't become it. Use it as you use other machines. 
Mind is a beautiful machine. If you can use it, it will serve you; if you 
cannot use it and it starts using you, it is destructive, it is dangerous. It is 
bound to take you into some trouble, into some calamity, into some suf-
fering and misery, because a machine is a blind thing. It has no eyes, it has 
no insight. 
M i n d cannot see; it can only go on repeating that w h i c h has been fed 
into it. It is like a computer; first you have to feed it. That's w h a t your 
71

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
so-called education is, you go on feeding it. T h e n it becomes a great 
storehouse of m e m o r y in you, so whenever you need to remember any-
thing it can supply it. But you should re-
main the master so that you can use it; 
otherwise it starts directing you. 
D o n ' t be guided by your car; remain a 
driver. You have to decide the direction, 
you have to decide the goal. You have to 
decide about the speed, w h e n to start and 
w h e n to stop. W h e n you lose control and 
w h e n the car takes over and it starts going 
on its o w n you are doomed. 
I am not absolutely against informa-
tion. Information is good if it is stored in 
the m e m o r y and whenever you need it 
you can find it easily. It is dangerous only 
w h e n you don't need it and it goes on 
throwing itself at you. W h e n it forces you 
to do something, w h e n you are just a vic-
tim, then it is dangerous. Otherwise it is 
beautiful. It is a beautiful means, but it is not the end. 
At Bible school the teacher was asking his class questions. He 
turned to Jenkins: " W h o knocked d o w n the walls of Jericho?" 
"Please, sir," replied Jenkins. "It was not me." 
T h e teacher was very annoyed. He went to the headmaster 
and said, "I have just asked Jenkins w h o knocked d o w n the walls 
of Jericho and he said it was not him. W h a t do you think about 
that?" 
T h e headmaster said, "I have k n o w n the Jenkins family for 
years, and if he said it wasn't him, it wasn't." 
N o w the teacher was even m o r e annoyed. He p h o n e d the 
Minister of Education and said, "I asked a boy in class, W h o 
72

FROM MIND TO NO MIND 
knocked d o w n the walls of Jericho,' and he said it wasn't him. I 
then w e n t to the headmaster to complain about the boy. He said 
he had k n o w n the family for years and if the boy said it wasn't 
him, it wasn't him. W h a t do you think about that?" 
T h e minister was silent for a second, then said, "Listen, I am 
fed up with complaints from your school. Get the walls repaired, 
and if there are m o r e complaints I am going to shut that school 
down!" 
Information is not bad in itself—you have to k n o w w h o knocked 
down the walls of Jericho! But if information becomes so powerful in 
your m i n d that it goes on and on and you cannot switch it off, you can-
not put the m i n d in a state of relaxation, then the m i n d becomes weary, 
tired, bored, exhausted. In that state, h o w can you be intelligent? Your 
energies are dissipated. Intelligence needs overflowing energies. Intelli-
gence needs health, wholeness. 
A meditator will be m o r e intelligent than anybody else. A n d a m e d -
itator will be able to use his m i n d objectively and subjectively both. He 
will be able to move inside as easily as he is able to move outside. He will 
be m o r e flexible. He is the master. He can take the car forward, he can 
take the car backward. 
W h e n Ford made his first car there was no reverse gear in it. It was a 
difficult problem to come back h o m e . You had to go round, you had to 
take the long route, just to come back h o m e . Even if you had gone a few 
yards past your garage, you could not back up to the garage—there was 
no reverse gear. Later on it was added. 
Meditation gives you a reverse gear. Ordinarily you don't have it, and 
you have to go round the world again and again and still you cannot find 
where your h o m e is. You cannot come back, you cannot go in; you k n o w 
only h o w to go out. A meditator becomes m o r e fluid, m o r e flexible. His 
life becomes richer. 
I am n o t in favor of those people w h o in the past, in the name of 
religion, became fixated in their introversion; that is another extreme. A 
73

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
few people are fixated as extroverts—as a reaction, a few other people 
become fixated as introverts. Both become dead. Life belongs to the flex-
ible, to one w h o can move from extrover-
sion to introversion and from introversion 
to extroversion as easily as you move out-
side and inside your house. W h e n it is too 
cold inside you come out in the sun; w h e n 
it becomes too hot you come inside under 
the shelter, into the coolness of the house, 
and there is no problem. It is as simple as 
that. 
Meditation 
does 
not 
mean 
going 
against the outside world. It has been so in 
the past. That's w h y religion has failed, it 
could not succeed; it could not have suc-
ceeded in any way. Life belongs to the 
fluid, to the flowing. W h e n e v e r you be-
come fixated you b e c o m e a thing. 
Your 
m o n k s 
were 
introverts; 
they 
closed their eyes to the outside world. 
That's w h y in the East we could not develop science, although the first 
steps of science were taken in the East. Mathematics was developed in 
India. T h e first steps toward technology were taken in China. But there 
it stopped for the simple reason that the greatest people in the East be-
came fixed as introverts; they lost interest in the objective world, they 
closed themselves totally to the objective. This is being only half of your 
total potential. 
T h e West has done just the opposite: It has b e c o m e utterly extro-
verted, it does not k n o w h o w to go in. It does not believe that there is 
any "in," it does not believe in any soul. It believes in man's behavior, not 
in man's inner existence. It studies the behavior of m a n and it says it is all 
mechanical, there is n o b o d y inside it. M a n has b e c o m e a robot. If you 
don't k n o w the soul, m a n becomes a robot. He is understood to be just

a beautiful mechanism developed over millions of years—the long, long 
journey of evolution—but he is only a sophisticated machine. 
It was not difficult for Adolf Hitler to kill so many people so easily 
for the simple reason that if m a n is a machine, what is the h a r m in killing 
people? If you destroy your wristwatch you don't feel guilty; however so-
phisticated it was, it was only a wristwatch. If you decided to destroy it, it 
is for you to decide; n o b o d y can object. You cannot be dragged into 
court as a murderer. 
Stalin could kill millions of people easily without any prick in his 
conscience for the simple reason that Marxism believes that there is no 
soul. M a n is nothing but matter; consciousness is only a by-product of 
matter. This is one extreme. 
Science developed in the West, but spirituality disappeared. In the 
East, spirituality developed but science disappeared. In both ways m a n 
remains poor, and living only half his potential. My effort is to create the 
whole h u m a n being, w h o will be able to be scientific and spiritual 
together. 
A big, mangy dog was threatening a m o t h e r cat and her kittens. He had 
backed them into the corner of a barn, w h e n suddenly the cat reared back 
on her hind legs and started barking and growling loudly. Startled and 
confused, the dog turned and ran from the barn, its tail tucked between 
its legs. 
Turning to her kittens, the m o t h e r cat lifted a paw and told them, 
N o w do you see the advantage of being bilingual?" 
I Want h u m a n beings to be bilingual. T h e y should k n o w science as m u c h , 
as deeply, as they should k n o w meditation. T h e y should k n o w m i n d as 
much as they should k n o w meditation. They should k n o w the language 
of the objective world—that is science—and they should k n o w also the 
language of the subjective world—that is spirituality. 
75

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
FROM T H I N K I N G T O U N D E R S T A N D I N G 
T h i n k i n g is the absence of understanding. You think because you don't 
understand. W h e n understanding arises, thinking disappears. It is like a 
blind m a n groping his way; w h e n you have eyes, you don't grope for the 
way, you see it. Understanding is like having eyes; you see, you don't 
grope. T h i n k i n g is g r o p i n g — n o t know-
ing what is what, you go on thinking, 
guessing. 
T h i n k i n g cannot give you the right 
answer because thinking can only repeat 
that which is known. Thinking has no vi-
sion for the u n k n o w n . Have you ever tried 
thinking about the u n k n o w n ? H o w will 
you think about it? You can think only 
about that w h i c h you already know; it is 
repetitive. You can go on thinking it again 
and again, you can make n e w combina-
tions of old thoughts, but nothing really is new. 
76 
O n l y a person w h o is able to bridge the objective and the subjec-
tive, a person w h o is able to bridge the East and the West, a person w h o 
is able to bridge the materialist and the spiritualist, can be a w h o l e per-
son. T h e world is waiting for the w h o l e h u m a n being. If the w h o l e h u -
m a n being does n o t arrive soon, then there is no future for humanity. 
A n d the w h o l e h u m a n being can c o m e only through deep, profound 
intelligence. 
I am not against intellect, I am not against intelligence; I am against 
intellectuality. D o n ' t get identified with your mind. Always remain a 
watcher on the hills—a witness to the body, to the mind, a witness to the 
outer and to the inner, so that you can transcend b o t h the outer and the 
inner and you can k n o w that you are neither—you are beyond both.

Understanding is fresh, new. It has nothing to do with the past. U n -
derstanding is here, now. It is an insight into reality. 
W i t h thinking there are questions and questions and no answers. 
Even sometimes w h e n you feel that you 
have found an answer, it is just because one 
has to decide in some way or other. It is 
not really the answer, but you have to d e -
cide in order to act, so some answer has to 
be clung to. A n d if you look deeply into 
your answer, you will see a thousand and 
one questions arising out of it. 
Understanding has no questions but 
only answers, because it has eyes. 
T h i n k i n g 
is 
borrowed. 
All 
your 
thoughts 
are 
given 
by 
others 
to 
you. 
Watch—can you find a single thought that 
is yours, authentically yours, that you have 
given birth to? They are all borrowed. T h e 
sources may be k n o w n or u n k n o w n , but 
they are all borrowed. T h e m i n d functions 
like a computer, but before the computer 
can give you any answer you have to feed it. You have to supply all the 
information; then it will give you the answer. That's what the m i n d has 
been doing. 
M i n d is a biocomputer. You go on collecting data, knowledge, infor-
mation, and then w h e n a certain question arises your m i n d supplies the 
answer out of that collection. It is not a real response; it is just out of the 
dead past. 
W h a t is understanding? Understanding is pure intelligence. That 
pure intelligence is originally yours; you are b o r n with it. N o b o d y can 
give you intelligence. Knowledge can be given to you, not intelligence. 
Intelligence is your o w n sharpened being. T h r o u g h deep meditation one 
sharpens one's being; through meditation one drops borrowed thoughts,

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
78 
reclaims one's o w n being, reclaims one's originality—reclaims one's 
childhood, innocence, freshness. O u t of that freshness, w h e n you act, you 
act out of understanding. A n d then the re-
sponse is total, here-now; and the response 
is because of the challenge, not because of 
the past. 
For example, somebody asks you a 
question—what do you do? You i m m e d i -
ately go inside the m i n d and find the 
answer. You immediately go into the base-
m e n t of the m i n d where you have col-
lected all your knowledge, and find the 
answer there. T h e n it is thinking. 
S o m e b o d y asks a question and you 
b e c o m e silent; you look into the question with penetrating eyes; not 
into the m e m o r y , but into the question. You face the question, you e n -
counter the question. If you don't know, you say you don't know. For 
example, somebody asks w h e t h e r G o d exists or not. You immediately 
say, 'Yes, G o d exists." F r o m where is this answer coming? F r o m your 
m e m o r y ? Your Christian memory, H i n d u m e m o r y , M u s l i m m e m o r y ? 
T h e n it is almost useless, futile. If you have a c o m m u n i s t m e m o r y you 
will say, " N o , there is no God." If you have a Catholic m e m o r y you will 
say, "Yes, there is a God." If you have a Buddhist m e m o r y you will say, 
" T h e r e is no God." But these answers are c o m i n g from the m e m o r y . If 
you are a person of understanding you will simply listen to the ques-
tion, you will go deep into the question. You will simply watch. If you 
don't know, you will say, "I don't know." If you know, only then will 
you say you know. A n d w h e n I say "if you know," I mean, if you have 
realized. 
A m a n of understanding is true. Even if he says, "I don't know," his 
ignorance is m o r e valuable than the knowledge of the mind, because at 
least his ignorance, his acceptance of the ignorance, is closer to truth. At 
least he is not trying to pretend, he is not a hypocrite.

From Mind To No Mind 
Watch, and you will see that all your answers come from your 
memory. T h e n try to find the place where m e m o r y does not function 
and pure consciousness functions. That is what understanding is. 
I have heard . . . 
T h e doctor stepped into the patient's room. Five minutes 
later he came out and asked for a corkscrew, then he w e n t back 
to his patient. In another five minutes he was out again and d e -
m a n d e d a chisel and hammer. 
T h e distraught husband couldn't stand it any longer. He 
pleaded, "For heaven's sake, Doctor, what is w r o n g with my 
wife?" 
"I don't k n o w yet," the doctor replied. "I can't get my bag 
opened." 
Sometimes even w h e n you say, "I don't know," it is not necessarily 
coming out of understanding. It may be simply that you can't open your 
bag. It may be that you cannot open your memories, or you are not able 
to find something in the m e m o r y ; you need time. You say, "I don't know. 
Give me time, let me think about it." W h a t will you do by thinking? If 
you know, you know; if you don't know, you don't know. W h a t are you 
going to think about? But you say, "Give me time, I will think about it." 
What are you saying? You are saying, "I will have to go into the basement 
of my m i n d and search. A n d there is such rubbish accumulated through 
the years that it is difficult to find, but I will do my best." 
Meditate, and become free from this basement. It is not that the 
basement is not useful; it can be used. But it should not become a substi-
tute for your understanding. 
A m a n of understanding looks into things directly. His insight is di-
rect. But he can use all his accumulation of knowledge to help the in 
sight to reach you. He can use all that he has accumulated to make 
everything that he is trying to convey to you clear. But that w h i c h he is 
trying to convey is his own. T h e words may be borrowed, language may

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
80 
be borrowed—has to be borrowed—concepts may be borrowed, but not 
what he is trying to convey to you. T h e container will come from the 
memory, but the contents will be his insight. 
A n d of course, one w h o has no understanding is continuously a vic-
tim of so many thoughts, because he has no one insight to give h i m a 
center. He has a crowd of thoughts, unrelated to each other, even dia-
metrically opposite to each other—contradicting each other, with deep 
antagonism toward each other. He has a c r o w d — n o t even a group, not 
even a society, but a m o b — o f thoughts buzzing inside the mind. So if 
you go on with your thinking too far, one day you will become mad. Too 
m u c h thought can create insanity. 
In primitive societies, madness is rare. T h e more civilized a society is, 
the m o r e people go insane. Even in civilized societies, m o r e people go 
insane w h o w o r k with their intellects. This is unfortunate but this is a 
fact: M o r e psychoanalysts go mad than in any other profession. W h y ? 
Too m u c h thinking. It is very difficult to manage so many contradictory 
thoughts together. In trying to manage them, your w h o l e being becomes 
a chaos. 
Understanding is single, understanding is central. It is simple; 
thoughts are very complex. 
A henpecked husband visited a psychiatrist and said he had 
a recurring nightmare. 
"Every night," he said, "I dream I am shipwrecked with 
twelve beautiful w o m e n . " 
"What's so terrible about that?" asked the psychiatrist. 
"Have you ever tried cooing for twelve w o m e n ? " 
That was his problem: h o w to coo for twelve w o m e n . Even to coo 
for one w o m a n is difficult. 
T h i n k i n g is like cooing for thousands and thousands of w o m e n 
around you. O n e naturally goes mad. Understanding is very simple: You

From Mind To No Mind 
are married to one insight, but that insight works like a light, a torch. 
Wherever you focus your torch, mysteries are revealed. Wherever you fo-
cus your torch, darkness disappears. 
Try to find your hidden understanding. A n d the way is to drop 
thinking. And to drop thinking there are two possibilities: either medita-
tion or love. 
FROM R E A C T I O N TO RESPONSE 
Reaction is from the thoughts and response is understanding. R e a c t i o n 
comes from the past; response is always in the present. But ordinarily we 
react—we have everything already ready inside. Somebody is doing 
something and we react as if a button has been pushed. Somebody insults 
you and you become angry—that has happened before, and it has been 
happening the same way all the while. It has b e c o m e almost like a but-
ton: Somebody pushes it, you become angry. There is not a single m o -
m e n t of waiting, not a single m o m e n t where you look at the situation to 
see if it may be different. T h e person w h o is insulting you may be right. 
He may have simply revealed a truth to you and that's w h y you feel in-
sulted. Or he may be absolutely wrong, or he may be just a nasty person. 
But you have to look into the person—if he is right, you have to thank 
h i m because he has shown something to you. He has shown compassion 
toward you, he has been friendly by bringing a truth to your heart. 
Maybe it hurts, but that is not his fault. 
Or maybe he is simply stupid, ignorant. N o t knowing anything 
about you, he has blurted out something. T h e n there is no need to be an-
gry; he is simply wrong. N o b o d y is worried about something that is ab-
solutely wrong. Unless it has some truth in it, you are never irritated by 
it. You can laugh at it, at the w h o l e absurdity of it. It is ridiculous. 
Or the person is just nasty and that is his way. He is insulting to 
everybody. So he is n o t doing anything to you in particular; he is simply 
81

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
82 
being himself—that's all. So in fact, nothing needs to be done. He is just 
that type of person. 
Somebody insulted Buddha. His disciple Ananda said, "I was getting 
very angry and you kept quiet. You should have at least allowed me to say 
something; I would have put h i m right." 
Buddha said, "You surprise me. First he surprised me, and n o w you 
surprise me. Whatever he was saying is simply irrelevant. It is u n c o n -
nected with us, so w h y get into it? But you surprise me even more: You 
have b e c o m e very annoyed, you look angry. This is foolish. To punish 
oneself for somebody else's error is foolish. You are punishing yourself. 
Cool down. There is no need to be angry—because anger is fire. W h y 
are you burning your o w n soul? If he has committed some mistake, w h y 
do you punish yourself? It is stupid." But we react. 
I have heard . . . 
O n e m a n was saying to one of his friends, "To please my 
wife, I have given up smoking, drinking, and playing cards." 
"That must make her very happy," said his friend. 
" N o , it has not. Now, every time she begins to talk to me, 
she can't think of anything to say." 
People live mechanical, robotlike lives. If your wife has been contin-
uously nagging you to stop smoking, and you think she will be happy if 
you stop, you are wrong. If you smoke she is unhappy, and if you stop 
smoking she will be unhappy because then she will not find any excuse 
to nag you. 
O n e w o m a n said to me that she didn't want her husband to be per-
fect. I asked, " W h y ? " She said, "Because I love nagging." If the husband 
is perfect what are you going to do? You will be simply at a loss. 
Watch yourself, watch others, and see h o w they are behaving in a 
mechanical way—unconscious, like somnambulists, sleepwalkers. 
Reaction is of the mind; response is of the n o - m i n d .

From Mind To No Mind 
FROM BELIEF TO FAITH 
Belief is of the mind, of the thinking; faith is of no-mind, of awareness, 
understanding. 
It happened in a hillside village: the hunter said to his guide, 
"This seems to be a very dangerous cliff. It's a w o n d e r they 
don't put up a warning sign." 
" T h e y had one up for two years," the native guide admit-
ted, "but no one fell off the cliff so they took it down." 
Belief is blind—you believe because you have been taught to believe, 
but it never goes very deep because it has no understanding of the situa-
tion. It is just a superfluous tag, just something added to you. It has n o t 
grown from you, it has not been a growth of your understanding. It is 
just borrowed, so it never penetrates your being. For a few days you carry 
it, and then seeing that it is useless and nothing is happening, you put it 
aside. There are Christians w h o are n o t Christians; there are Hindus w h o 
are not Hindus. T h e y are Hindus only because of those beliefs that they 
have never used, those beliefs that they have never respected. T h e y think 
they are Christians, Hindus, M o h a m m e d a n s , but h o w can you be a M o -
hammedan if you have not lived your belief? 
But the truth is that belief cannot be lived. If one starts b e c o m i n g 
more alert, watching life, responding, then by and by a faith arises. Faith 
is yours; belief is somebody else's. D r o p beliefs so that faith can arise. A n d 
don't be satisfied with beliefs, otherwise faith will never arise. 
FROM SYMPATHY TO C O M P A S S I O N 
Sympathy is of the mind: You feel somebody is in trouble, somebody is in 
misery; you think somebody is in misery and you have to help. You have

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
84 
been taught to help, to be of service, to be dutiful, to be a good h u m a n 
being, to be a good citizen, to be this and that. You have been taught, so 
you feel sympathy. 
Compassion has nothing to do with your teachings. Compassion 
arises as an empathy, not as a sympathy. Compassion arises w h e n you can 
see the other person as he is, and w h e n you can see h i m so totally that 
you start feeling him. You start feeling in the same situation. 
It happened: Ramakrishna was moving from one bank to another of 
the Ganges, near Dakshineshwar. On the other shore, a few people had 
surrounded a fisherman and they were beating him. Ramakrishna was in 
the middle of the river. He started crying and weeping, and he started 
shouting, "Stop, don't beat me!" T h e people w h o were sitting around 
him, in the boat, his disciples, could not believe what was happening: 
" W h o is beating you?" they said. " W h a t are you saying, have you gone 
mad?" He said, "Look! They are beating me there on the other side." 
T h e n they looked; they saw that the people were beating the man. 
A n d Ramakrishna said, "Look at my back." He uncovered his back— 
there were marks on his back, he was bleeding. It was impossible to b e -
lieve. T h e disciples rushed to the other shore, caught hold of the man 
w h o was beaten and uncovered his back: He had exactly the same marks. 
This is empathy—putting oneself into somebody else's place so to-
tally that what is happening to h i m starts happening to you. T h e n c o m -
passion arises. But these states are all of n o - m i n d . 
FROM C O M M U N I C A T I O N T O C O M M U N I O N 
C o m m u n i c a t i o n is of the mind—verbal, intellectual, conceptual. C o m -
m u n i o n is of n o - m i n d , of deep silence; a transfer of energy, nonverbal; a 
j u m p from one heart to another—immediate, without any medium. 
T h e basic, most essential thing to remember—because it divides your 
life, it divides the w h o l e world into two worlds—is that if you are look-
ing through a screen of thoughts, then you live in one world. T h e world

From Mind To No Mind 
of thoughts is the world of belief, thinking, sympathy. If you are looking 
with clean eyes, unclouded eyes, your perception has a clarity. It is pure, 
just seeing into things as they are, not projecting anything u p o n them. 
T h e n you have understanding, then you have meditation. T h e n the 
whole world changes. A n d the problem is that m i n d can deceive you. It 
creates sympathy. It creates false coins: In place of compassion it creates 
sympathy. Sympathy is a false coin. In place of c o m m u n i o n it has only 
communication, which is a false coin. Instead of faith it has belief, w h i c h 
is a false coin. 
R e m e m b e r it—the m i n d tries to substitute. Are you lacking some-
thing? T h e m i n d tries to substitute for it. Be very alert, because whatever 
the m i n d can do is going to be false. M i n d is the great falsifier, the great-
est deceiver there is. It helps, it tries to console you, it gives you some-
thing false so that you no longer hanker for the real. 
For example, if during the day you have fasted, in the night you will 
dream of food, dining in great restaurants, or being invited to the palaces 
of the kings and eating beautiful food. W h y ? T h e w h o l e day you have 
been hungry, n o w it is difficult to sleep b e -
cause of the hunger; the m i n d creates a 
substitute, a dream. Have you not watched 
it? In the night your bladder is full and you 
would like to go to the bathroom, but if 
you do your sleep will be disturbed—the 
mind immediately creates a dream that you 
are in the bathroom. T h e n you can go on 
sleeping. It gives you a substitute. T h e sub-
stitute is a consolation. It is not real, but for 
the time being it helps. 
So 
beware 
of mind's 
consolations. 
Seek reality, because only reality can fulfill 
you. Consolations can never be fulfilling. 
You can eat as m u c h food as you like in your dreams, you can enjoy the 
fragrance of it, the taste of it, the color of it, everything—but it is not 
85

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
86 
going to be nourishing. Belief can give you the whole fragrance of faith, 
the taste, the color. You can enjoy it but it will not nourish you. O n l y 
faith can nourish. 
Always remember: That which nourishes you is real, and that which 
simply gives you a consolation is very dangerous. Because of this conso-
lation you will not seek the real food. If you start living in dreams and 
you don't eat real food, then by and by you will dissipate, disappear, be-
come dry, and you will be dead. 
So take immediate action: Whenever the m i n d is trying to give you 
a substitute, don't listen to it. It is a great salesman, a great seducer. It 
convinces you, it says, "These things are cheap. Faith is very difficult to 
find because you will have to risk your life; belief is easy, very cheap. You 
can get it for nothing." In fact, so many people are ready—if you accept 
their belief they are ready to give you something m o r e with it: Become a 
Christian, b e c o m e a H i n d u , become a M o h a m m e d a n . People are ready 
to give you a great welcome and respect, respectability. Everything is 
available; just accept their belief. Belief is n o t only cheap, it can even 
bring many m o r e things with it. 
Faith is dangerous, never cheap. Understanding is dangerous, never 
cheap. T h e real is dangerous. You will have to put your whole life at 
stake. It needs courage. 
THE MASTER A N D THE SERVANT 
I have heard an ancient story: 
A king was very happy with one of his servants. He was so devoted, 
so totally devoted to the king; he was always ready to sacrifice his life for 
the king. T h e king was immensely happy, and m a n y times he had saved 
the king, risking his o w n life. He was the king's bodyguard. 
O n e day the king was feeling so happy with the man, he said, "If you 
desire anything, if you have any desire, just tell me and I will fulfill it. You 
have done so m u c h for me that I can never show my gratitude, I can

From Mind To No Mind 
never repay you, but today I would like to fulfill any of your wishes, 
whatsoever it is." 
T h e servant said, "You have already given me too m u c h . I am so 
blessed just by being always with y o u — I don't need anything." 
But the king insisted. T h e m o r e the servant said, " T h e r e is no 
need," the m o r e the king insisted. Finally the servant said, " T h e n it's 
okay. You make me the king for twenty-four hours and you be the guard." 
T h e king was a little apprehensive, afraid, but he was a m a n of his 
word and he had to fulfill the desire. So for twenty-four hours he became 
the guard and the guard became the king. A n d do you k n o w what the 
guard did? T h e first thing that he did, he ordered the king to be killed, 
sentenced to death! 
T h e king said, " W h a t are you doing?" 
He said, "You keep quiet! You are simply the guard and nothing 
more. It is my wish and n o w I am the king!" 
T h e king was killed, and the servant became the king forever. 
Servants have their o w n devious ways to become masters. 
T h e m i n d is one of the most beautiful, the most complex, the most 
evolved mechanisms. It has served you well, it continues to serve you 
well. Because of its services you have repeated the same story in your 
life—everybody has repeated the same story. You have made the m i n d 
the master, and n o w the master treats you just like a servant. 
This is the p r o b l e m — n o t that the m i n d has to be thrown out. If you 
throw the m i n d out you will go insane. W i t h o u t the m i n d there is only 
one profession you can be in, and that is politics! 
I have heard that a m a n — i t must be some story from the future—a 
man went to the hospital because his brain was damaged in a car accident 
and he wanted a n e w one. So he asked the surgeon to show h i m all the 
kinds of brains available. T h e surgeon took h i m around; there were m a n y 
brains. T h e first brain belonged to a professor, a mathematician. He asked 
the price—fifty dollars. He was surprised: a famous mathematician,

Intelligence is the clear insight into things about w h i c h you don't have 
any information. M e m o r y can function only with those things w h i c h are 
k n o w n to y o u — b u t life consists of the known, of the u n k n o w n , and of 
the unknowable. As far as the k n o w n is concerned, m e m o r y is enough. 
That's what all your universities and all your educational systems are 
doing: They are simply feeding your m e m o r y with m o r e and m o r e in-
formation, and whatever is k n o w n to your m e m o r y system, you will be 
88 
a N o b e l laureate, just fifty dollars! T h e n there was a musician, and his was 
only thirty dollars. T h e n there was a busi-
nessman's brain and it was only twenty 
dollars. A n d so on, so forth. Finally they 
came to the brain of a politician—it was 
five thousand dollars! T h e m a n was puz-
zled. He said, " W h y does it cost so m u c h ? " 
T h e surgeon said, "Because it has never 
been used." 
You will need all the m i n d you h a v e — 
just be the master of it. Use it, and don't be 
used by it. 
A n d 
that's 
what 
meditation 
is 
all 
about: the art of moving away from the 
mind, being above the mind, becoming 
transcendental to the mind, knowing that 
"I am not the mind." That does not mean 
that you have to throw out the mind. 
K n o w i n g that you are not the m i n d makes 
you again the master. T h e n you can use 
the mind. R i g h t now, the m i n d is not 
within your hands.

able to answer immediately. That answer does not prove that you are in-
telligent. 
Intelligence is k n o w n only w h e n you 
encounter the u n k n o w n , about w h i c h you 
don't have any memory, any knowledge, 
any information beforehand. W h e n you 
encounter the u n k n o w n , that is the point 
which is decisive. H o w do you respond? 
Intelligence means the capability to 
respond to n e w situations. It comes from 
your being—the m i n d is only a vehicle—a 
kind of awareness of what the m i n d is, 
without belonging to it. Intelligence is the 
quality of the witness; it watches the m i n d 
and it gives direction to the mind. 
A story: 
The student Doko came to the master 
and asked, 
"In what state of mind should 
I seek the truth?" 
The 
master replied, 
"There 
is 
no 
mind, so you cannot put it in any state, and there is no truth, so you 
cannot seek it." 
Doko said, "If there is no mind and no truth, why do all these stu-
dents gather before you every day to study?" 
The master looked around and said, 
"I don't see anyone." 
The inquirer asked, "Then who are you teaching?" 
"I have no tongue, so how can I teach?" replied the master. 
Then Doko said sadly, "I cannot follow you; I cannot understand." 
The master said, 
"I don't understand myself." 
Life is such a mystery, no one can understand it, and one w h o claims 
that he understands it is simply ignorant. He is not aware of what he is 
89

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
90 
saying, of what nonsense he is talking. If you are wise, this will be the 
first realization: Life cannot be understood. Understanding is impossible. 
O n l y this m u c h can be understood—that understanding is impossible. 
That is what this beautiful Z e n anecdote says. 
T h e master says, "I don't understand it myself." If you go and ask the 
enlightened ones this will be their answer. But if you go and ask the u n -
enlightened ones they will give you many answers, they will propose 
many doctrines; they will try to solve the mystery which cannot be solved. 
It is not a riddle. A riddle can be solved, a mystery is unsolvable by its 
very nature—there is no way to solve it. Socrates said, " W h e n I was 
young, I thought I k n e w m u c h . W h e n I became old, ripe in wisdom, I 
came to understand that I k n e w nothing." 
It is reported of one of the Sufi masters, Junnaid, that he was work-
ing with a n e w young man. T h e young man was not aware of Junnaid's 
inner wisdom, and Junnaid lived such an ordinary life that it needed very 
penetrating eyes to realize that you were near a buddha. He worked like 
an ordinary laborer, and only those w h o had eyes would recognize him. 
To recognize Buddha was very easy—he was sitting under a Bodhi tree; 
to recognize Junnaid was very difficult—he was working like a laborer, 
not sitting under a Bodhi tree. He was in every way absolutely ordinary. 
O n e young m a n was working with him, and that young m a n was 
continually showing his knowledge, so whatsoever Junnaid would do, he 
would say, "This is wrong. This can be done in this way, it will be better." 
He k n e w about everything. Finally Junnaid laughed and said, "Young 
man, I am not y o u n g enough to k n o w so much." 
This is really something. He said, "I am not y o u n g enough to know 
so much." O n l y a y o u n g man can be so foolish, so inexperienced. 
Socrates was right w h e n he said, " W h e n I was young, I k n e w too much. 
W h e n I became ripened, experienced, I came to realize only one thing— 
that I was absolutely ignorant." 
Life is a mystery; that means it cannot be solved. A n d w h e n all efforts 
to solve it prove futile, the mystery dawns u p o n you. T h e n the doors are 
open; then you are invited. As a knower, n o b o d y enters the divine; as

From Mind To No Mind 
a child, ignorant, not knowing at all, the mystery embraces you. W i t h a 
knowing m i n d you are clever, not innocent. Innocence is the door. 
This Z e n master was right w h e n he said, "I don't understand it m y -
self." It was very deep, really deep, the deepest answer possible. But this is 
the last part of the anecdote. Start from the very beginning . . . 
T h e disciple came to the Z e n master and said, "In what state of 
mind should I seek the truth?" T h e master said, " T h e r e is no m i n d so 
there cannot be any state of mind." 
M i n d is the illusion, that w h i c h is not but appears to be, and appears 
to be so m u c h that you think that you are the mind. M i n d is maya, m i n d 
is just a dream, m i n d is just a projection . . . a soap bubble floating on a 
river. T h e sun is just rising, the rays penetrate the bubble; a rainbow is 
created and nothing is there in it. W h e n you touch the bubble it is b r o -
ken and everything disappears—the rain-
bow, the beauty—nothing is left. 
O n l y 
emptiness becomes one with the infinite 
emptiness. Just a wall was there, a bubble 
wall. Your m i n d is just a bubble wall— 
inside, your emptiness; outside, my empti-
ness. It is just a bubble, prick it, and the 
mind disappears. 
T h e master said, " T h e r e is no mind, so 
what type of state are you asking about?" 
It is difficult to understand. People come 
to me and they say, " W e would like to 
attain a silent state of mind." T h e y think 
that the m i n d can be silent; m i n d can never 
be silent. M i n d means the turmoil, the ill-
ness, the disease; m i n d means the tense, 
the anguished state. T h e m i n d cannot be 
silent. W h e n there is silence there is no mind. W h e n silence comes, m i n d 
disappears; w h e n m i n d is there, silence is no more. So there cannot be 
any silent mind, just as there cannot be any healthy disease. Is it possible 
91

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
92 
to have a healthy disease? W h e n health is there, disease disappears. Silence 
is the inner health; m i n d is the inner disease, inner disturbance. 
So there cannot be any silent mind, and this disciple is asking, " W h a t 
type, what sort, w h a t state of m i n d should I achieve?" Point-blank, the 
master said, "There is no mind, so you cannot achieve any state." So 
please drop this illusion; don't try to achieve any state in the illusion. It's 
as if you are thinking to travel on the rainbow and you ask me, " W h a t 
steps should we take to travel on the rainbow?" I say, "There is no rainbow. 
T h e rainbow is just an appearance, so no steps can be taken." A rainbow 
simply appears; it is n o t there. It is n o t a reality, it is a false interpretation 
of the reality. 
T h e m i n d is not your reality; it is a false interpretation. You are not 
the mind, you have never been a mind, you can never be the mind. That 
is your problem—you have become identified with something w h i c h is 
not. You are like a beggar w h o believes that he has a kingdom. He is so 
worried about the k i n g d o m — h o w to manage it, h o w to govern it, how 
to prevent anarchy. T h e r e is no kingdom, but he is worried. 
C h u a n g T z u once dreamt that he had b e c o m e a butterfly. In the 
m o r n i n g he was very m u c h depressed. His friends asked, " W h a t has hap-
pened? We have never seen you so depressed." C h u a n g T z u said, "I am in 
a puzzle, I am at a loss, I cannot understand. In the night, while asleep, I 
dreamt that I had b e c o m e a butterfly." 
So the friends laughed. " N o b o d y is ever disturbed by dreams. W h e n 
you awake, the dream has disappeared, so w h y are you disturbed?" 
C h u a n g T z u said, " T h a t is not the point. N o w I am puzzled: If 
C h u a n g T z u can b e c o m e a butterfly in the dream, it is possible that now 
the butterfly has gone to sleep and is dreaming that she is C h u a n g Tzu." 
If C h u a n g T z u can b e c o m e a butterfly in the dream, w h y not the other? 
T h e butterfly can dream and become C h u a n g Tzu. So what is real— 
whether C h u a n g T z u dreamt that he has b e c o m e a butterfly, or the but-
terfly is dreaming that she has b e c o m e C h u a n g Tzu? W h a t is real? 
R a i n b o w s are there. You can become a butterfly in the dream. A n d you 
have become a m i n d in this bigger dream you call life. W h e n you awaken

you don't achieve an awakened state of mind, you achieve a no-state of 
mind, you achieve n o - m i n d . 
W h a t does n o - m i n d mean? It is difficult to follow. But sometimes, 
unknowingly, you have achieved it. You may n o t have recognized it. 
Some times, just sitting ordinarily, not doing anything, there is no thought 
in the mind—because m i n d is just the process of thinking. It is not a sub-
stance, it is just a procession. You are here in this auditorium where I am 
speaking. I can say a crowd is here, but is there really something like a 
crowd? Is a crowd substantial, or are only individuals here? By and by in-
dividuals will go away, then will there be any crowd left behind? W h e n 
individuals have gone, there is no crowd. 
T h e mind is just like a crowd; thoughts are the individuals. A n d b e -
cause thoughts are there continuously, you 
think the process is substantial. D r o p each 
individual 
thought 
and 
finally 
nothing 
is left. 
There 
is 
no 
m i n d 
as 
such, 
only 
thinking. 
T h e thoughts are m o v i n g so fast that 
between two thoughts you cannot see the 
interval. But the interval is always there. 
That interval is you. In that interval there 
is neither C h u a n g T z u n o r the butterfly— 
because the butterfly is a sort of m i n d and 
Chuang T z u is also a sort of mind. A 
butterfly is 
a 
different 
combination 
of 
thoughts, C h u a n g T z u again a different 
combination, but both are minds. W h e n 
the m i n d is n o t there, w h o are y o u — 
Chuang T z u or a butterfly? Neither. A n d 
what is the state? Are you in an enlight-
ened state of mind? If you think you are in an enlightened state of m i n d 
this is again a thought, and w h e n thought is there you are not. If you feel 
93

that you are a buddha, this is a thought. T h e m i n d has entered; n o w the 
process of thinking is there, again the sky is clouded, the blueness lost. 
You can no longer see the infinite blueness. 
Between two thoughts, try to be alert—look into the interval, the 
space in between. You will see no mind; that is your nature. Because 
thoughts come and go—they are accidental—but that inner space always 
remains. Clouds gather and go, disappear—they are accidental—but the 
sky remains. You are the sky. 
O n c e it happened that a seeker came to Bayazid, a Sufi mystic, and 
asked, "Master, I am a very angry person. Anger happens to me very eas-
ily; I become really mad and I do things. I cannot even believe later on 
that I can do such things; I am not in my senses. So, h o w to drop this 
anger, h o w to overcome it, h o w to control it?" 
Bayazid took the head of the disciple in his hands and looked into his 
eyes. T h e disciple became a little uneasy, and Bayazid said, " W h e r e is that 
anger? I would like to see into it." 
T h e disciple laughed uneasily and said, " R i g h t now, I am not angry. 
Sometimes it happens." So Bayazid said, " T h a t w h i c h happens sometimes 
cannot be your nature. It is an accident. It comes and goes. It is like 
clouds—so w h y be worried about the clouds? T h i n k of the sky which is 
always there." 
This is the definition of consciousness, atma, 
the Self—the sky 
w h i c h is always there. All that comes and goes is irrelevant; don't be 
bothered by it, it is just smoke. T h e sky that remains eternally there never 
changes, never becomes different. Between two thoughts, drop into it; 
between two thoughts it is always there. Look into it and suddenly you 
will realize that you are in no-mind. 
T h e master was right w h e n he said, " T h e r e is no mind, so there can-
not be any state of mind. W h a t nonsense are you talking?" 
But the nonsense has its o w n logic. If you think that you have a 
mind, you will start thinking in terms of "states"—an ignorant state of 
mind, an enlightened state of mind. O n c e you accept mind, once you 
accept the illusory, you are b o u n d to go on dividing it. A n d once you 
I N T E L L I G E N C E

From Mind To No Mind 
accept that the m i n d exists, you will start seeking something or other. 
T h e m i n d can exist only if you keep seeking something. W h y ? Seek-
ing is desire, seeking is moving into the future, seeking creates dreams. So 
somebody is seeking power, politics, somebody is seeking riches, king-
doms, and then somebody is seeking the truth. But seeking is there, and 
seeking is the problem, not what you are seeking. T h e object is never the 
problem, any object will do. T h e m i n d can hang on to any object. Any 
excuse is enough for it to exist. 
T h e master said, " T h e r e is no state of m i n d because there is no 
mind. And there is no truth, so what are you talking about? There can be 
no seeking." 
This is one of the greatest messages ever delivered. It is very difficult; 
the disciple cannot conceive that there is no truth. W h a t does this master 
mean w h e n he says that there is no truth? Does he mean that there is no 
truth? 
N o , he is saying that for you, w h o are a seeker, there can be no truth. 
Seeking always leads into the untrue. O n l y a nonseeking m i n d realizes 
that w h i c h is. W h e n e v e r you seek, you have missed that w h i c h is. Seek-
ing always moves into the future, seeking cannot be here and now. H o w 
can you seek here and now? Here and now, you can only be. Seeking is 
desire—future enters, time comes i n — a n d this m o m e n t , this here and 
now is missed. Truth is here, now. 
If you go to a buddha and ask, "Is there G o d ? " he will deny it i m -
mediately: "There is no God." If he says there is, he creates a seeker; if he 
says there is God, you will start seeking. H o w can you remain quiet w h e n 
there is G o d to be sought? W h e r e should you r u n to find him? You have 
created another illusion. 
For millions of lives you have been a seeker, after this or after that, 
this object, that object, this world or that world, but a seeker. N o w you 
are a seeker after truth but the master says there is no truth. He cuts away 
the very ground of seeking, he pulls away the very ground where you are 
standing, where your m i n d is standing. He simply pushes you into the 
abyss.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
T h e inquirer said, " T h e n w h y are these many seekers all around you? 
If there is nothing to seek and no truth, then w h y this crowd?" T h e in-
quirer w e n t on missing the point. T h e master looked around and said, "I 
don't see anyone, there is no one here." T h e inquirer w e n t on missing the 
point because the intellect always goes on missing. He could have looked. 
This was the fact: There was no one. 
If you are n o t seeking you are not, because it is seeking that gives you 
the ego. R i g h t this m o m e n t , if you are not seeking anyone, anything, 
then you are not here—there is no crowd. If I am not teaching anything— 
because there is nothing to be taught, no truth to be taught—if I am not 
teaching anything and if you are not learning anything, w h o is here? 
Emptiness exists, and the bliss of pure emptiness. Individuals disappear 
and it becomes an oceanic consciousness. 
Individuals are there because of individual minds. You have a differ-
ent desire, that's w h y you differ from your neighbor. Desires create dis-
tinctions. I am seeking something, you are seeking something else; my 
path differs from yours, my goal differs from yours. That's w h y I differ 
from you. If I am not seeking and you are not seeking, goals disappear, 
paths are no longer there. How, then, can the minds exist? T h e cup is 
broken. My tea flows into you and your tea flows into me. It becomes an 
oceanic existence. 
T h e master looked around and said, "I don't see anyone—there is no 
one." 
But the intellect goes on missing. T h e inquirer said, " T h e n w h o m 
are you teaching? If there is no one, then w h o m are you teaching?" And 
the master said, "I have got no tongue, so h o w can I teach?" He goes on 
giving hints to become alert, to look, but the inquirer is engulfed in his 
o w n mind. T h e master goes on hitting, h a m m e r i n g on his head; he is 
talking nonsense just to bring h i m out of his mind. 
If you had been there you would have been convinced by the in-
quirer, not by the master. T h e inquirer would have appeared to be exactly 
right. This master seemed to be mad, absurd. He was talking! A n d he 
said, " T h e r e is no tongue, so h o w can I talk?" 
96

From Mind To No Mind 
He was saying, "Look at me, I am without form. Look at me, I am 
not embodied. T h e body appears to you but I am not that, so h o w can I 
talk?" 
T h e m i n d goes on missing. This is the misery of the mind. You push 
it, it again gathers itself; you hit it, and for a m o m e n t there is a sinking and 
a trembling, and again it is established. 
Have you seen the Japanese doll? They call it a daruma doll. You throw 
it whatever way—topsy-turvy, upside d o w n — b u t whatever you do, the 
doll sits in a buddha posture. T h e b o t t o m part is so heavy you cannot do 
anything. T h r o w it in any way and the doll again sits in a buddha posture. 
T h e name daruma comes from Bodhidharma; in Japan, Bodhidharma's 
name is Daruma. Bodhidharma used to say that your m i n d is just like this 
doll. He would throw it, kick it, but whatsoever he did he could not dis-
turb the doll; the b o t t o m part was so heavy. You throw it upside down, it 
will come right side up. 
So this master w e n t on pushing. A little shaking, and the doll sat up 
straight again, missed the point. Finally, desperate, the inquirer said, "I 
don't follow, I don't understand." A n d with the ultimate hit, the master 
said, "I don't understand myself." 
I go on teaching, k n o w i n g well there is nothing to be taught. That's 
why I can go on infinitely. If there were something to be taught I would 
have finished already. Buddhas can go on and on because there is nothing 
to be taught. It is an endless story, it never concludes, so I can go on and 
on. I will never be finished; you may be finished before my story ends, 
because there is no end to it. 
Somebody was asking me, " H o w do you manage to go on talking 
every day?" I said, "Because there is nothing to be taught." Someday you 
will suddenly feel it—that I am not talking, that I am n o t teaching. You 
have realized there is nothing to be taught because there is no truth. 
W h a t discipline am I giving to you? N o n e . A disciplined mind is again 
a mind, even more stubborn, m o r e adamant; a disciplined mind is m o r e 
stupid. Go and see the disciplined monks all over the world—Christian, 
Hindu, Jain. Whenever you see a m a n w h o is absolutely disciplined you

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
will find a stupid mind behind it. T h e flowing has stopped. He is so con-
cerned with finding something that he is ready to do whatever you say. If 
you say, "Stand on your head for an hour," he is ready to stand on his head. 
It is because of desire. If God can be achieved only through standing on his 
head for hours, he is ready, but he must achieve. 
I am not giving you any achieving, any desiring; there is nowhere to 
reach and nothing to achieve. If you realize this, you have achieved this 
very m o m e n t . This very m o m e n t you are perfect; nothing is to be done, 
nothing is to be changed. 
That's w h y the master said, "I don't understand it myself." It is diffi-
cult to find a master w h o says, "I don't understand it myself." A master 
has to claim that he knows, only then will you follow him. A master must 
not only claim that he knows, he must claim that only he knows, nobody 
else: "All other masters are wrong, I alone know." T h e n you will follow. 
You must be absolutely certain, then you b e c o m e a follower. T h e cer-
tainty gives you the feeling that here is the man, and if you follow you 
will reach. 
I will tell you one story. It happened once, a so-called mas-
ter was traveling. In every village he would go, he would d e -
clare, "I have achieved, I have k n o w n the divine. If you want, 
come and follow me." 
People would say, "There are many responsibilities. S o m e -
day, we hope we will be able to follow you." T h e y would touch 
his feet, give h i m respect, serve him, but n o b o d y w o u l d follow 
because there were m a n y other things to be done first before 
one w e n t to seek the divine. First things first. T h e divine is al-
ways the last, and the last thing never comes because the first are 
infinite; they are never finished. But in one village, a m a d m a n — 
he was mad, otherwise w h o would follow this master—said, 
" R i g h t . Have you have found G o d ? " 
T h e master hesitated a little, looking at the m a d m a n — 
because this m a n seemed dangerous, he might follow and create 
98

F r o m

N o - M i n d 
trouble—but in front of the w h o l e village he couldn't deny it, 
so he said, "Yes." 
T h e m a d m a n said, " N o w , initiate me. I will follow you to 
the very end. I want to realize G o d myself." T h e so-called mas-
ter became perturbed, but what to do? T h e m a d m a n started fol-
lowing him, he became just like his shadow. O n e year passed. 
T h e m a d m a n said, " H o w far, h o w far is the temple?" He said, "I 
am not in a h u r r y but h o w m u c h time will be needed?" By this 
time the master had b e c o m e very uncomfortable and uneasy 
with this man. This m a d m a n would sleep next to him, he would 
move with him; he had b e c o m e his shadow. And because of 
him, his certainty was dissolving. Whenever he would say, in a 
village, "Follow me," he would become afraid, because this m a n 
would look at h i m and say, "I am following you, master, and still 
I have not reached." 
T h e second year passed, the third year passed—the sixth 
year passed, and the m a d m a n said, " W e have not reached any-
where. We are simply traveling to different villages and you go 
on telling people, 'Follow me.' I am following—whatsoever you 
say, I do it, so you cannot say I am not following the discipline." 
T h e m a d m a n was really mad—whatever was told to h i m he 
would do. So the master couldn't deceive h i m by saying that he 
was not trying hard enough. Finally, one night, the master said 
to him, "Because of you I have lost my o w n path. Before I met 
you I was certain; n o w I am no more. N o w you please leave 
Whenever there is someone certain and you are mad enough, you 
start following. C a n you follow this type of man w h o says, "I myself 
don't know. I myself don't understand?" If you can follow this man, you 
will reach. You have already reached if you decide to follow this man, b e -
cause it is the m i n d that asks for certainty, the mind that asks for k n o w l -
edge. T h e m i n d also asks for dogmatic assertions, so if you can be ready 
99

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
to follow a m a n w h o says, "I don't k n o w myself," seeking has stopped. 
N o w you are not asking for knowledge. 
O n e w h o is asking for knowledge cannot ask for being. Knowledge 
is rubbish; being is life. W h e n you stop asking for knowledge you have 
stopped asking about the truth, because truth is the goal of knowledge. If 
you don't inquire w h a t is, but you become silent, mindless—that which 
is, is revealed. 
Everything is available, has been available always; you have never 
missed it. But just because of your seeking—because of the future, the 
goal—you cannot look. T h e truth surrounds you, you exist in it. Just like 
the fish exist in the ocean, you exist in the truth. Godliness is not a goal, 
godliness is what is here and now. These trees, these winds blowing, these 
clouds moving, the sky, you, I—this is what godliness is. It is not a goal. 
D r o p the m i n d and the god. G o d is not an object, it is a merger. T h e 
mind resists a merger, the mind is against surrender; the m i n d is very cun-
ning and calculating. 
This story is beautiful. You are the inquirer. You have come to ac-
quire knowledge, to solve the mystery, and I repeat to you: There is no 
state of mind, because there is no mind. T h e r e is no truth, so no seeking 
makes any sense. All seeking is futile; search as such is foolish. Seek and 
you will lose. D o n ' t seek and it is there. R u n and you will miss. Stop—it 
has always been there. 
A n d don't try to understand—be. 
Become ignorant, become like a child. O n l y the heart of a child can 
knock at the doors of the beyond, and only the heart of a child is heard.

A
ll kinds of conditionings are poisons. To think of oneself as a 
H i n d u is to think of oneself as opposed to humanity. To think 
of oneself as German, as Chinese, is to think of oneself as o p -
posed to humanity, is to think in terms of enmity, not friendship. 
T h i n k of yourself only as a h u m a n being. If you have any intelligence, 
think of yourself only as a simple h u m a n being. And w h e n your intelli-
gence grows a little more you will drop even the adjective human; you will 
think of yourself only as a being. A n d the being includes all—the trees and 
the mountains and the rivers and the stars and the birds and the animals. 
B e c o m e bigger, become huge. W h y are you living in tunnels? W h y 
are you creeping into small dark black holes? But you think you are liv-
ing in great ideological systems. You are not living in great ideological 
systems, because there are no great ideological systems. No idea is great 
enough to contain a h u m a n being; being-hood cannot be contained by 
any concept. All concepts cripple and paralyze. 
D o n ' t be a Catholic and don't be a communist, just be a h u m a n b e -
ing. These are all poisons, these are all prejudices. A n d down the ages you 
We been hypnotized into these prejudices. They have b e c o m e part of 
your blood, your bones, your very marrow. You will have to be very alert to get rid of all this poi

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
Your body is not poisoned as m u c h as your m i n d is. T h e body is a 
simple p h e n o m e n o n , it can be easily cleaned. If you have been eating 
nonvegetarian foods it can be stopped, it is 
not such a big deal. A n d if you stop eating 
meat, within three months your body will 
be completely free of all the poisons cre-
ated by nonvegetarian foods. It is simple. 
Physiology is not very complicated. 
But the problem arises with psychol-
ogy. A Jaina m o n k never eats any poisoned 
food, never eats anything nonvegetarian. 
But his m i n d is polluted and poisoned by 
Jainism as n o b o d y else's is. 
T h e real freedom is freedom from any 
ideology. Can't you simply live without 
any ideology? Is an ideology needed? W h y 
is an ideology needed so much? It is needed 
because it helps you to remain stupid, it is 
needed because it helps you to remain un-
intelligent. It is needed because it supplies 
you ready-made answers and you need not 
find t h e m on your own. 
T h e real m a n of intelligence will not cling to any ideology—for 
what? He will n o t carry a load of ready-made answers. He knows that he 
has enough intelligence so that whatever situation arises, he will be able 
to respond to it. W h y carry an unnecessary load from the past? W h a t is 
the point of carrying it? 
A n d in fact the m o r e you carry from the past, the less you will be 
able to respond to the present, because the present is not a repetition of 
the past, it is always new—always, always new. It is never the old; it may 
sometimes appear like the old, but it is not old, there are basic differences. 
Life never repeats itself. It is always fresh, always new, always grow-
ing, always exploring, always moving into n e w adventures. Your 
old 
102

103 
ready-made answers are not going to help you. In fact they will hinder 
you; they will not allow you to see the n e w situation. T h e situation will 
be new, and the answer will be old. 
That's w h y you look so stupid in life. 
But to remain stupid seems cheaper. To be 
intelligent needs effort, to be intelligent 
means you have to grow. A n d growth is 
painful. To be intelligent means you have 
to be continuously alert and aware; you 
cannot fall asleep, you cannot live like a 
somnambulist. 
A n d to be intelligent has a few m o r e 
dangers, too. To be intelligent is very diffi-
cult because you have to live with the stu-
pid crowds. To live with blind people and 
have eyes is a dangerous situation; they are 
bound to destroy your eyes. T h e y cannot 
tolerate you, you are an offense. 
Hence Jesus is crucified, Socrates is 
poisoned, Al-Hillaj is killed, Sarmad is b e -
headed. These were the most intelligent 
people that have ever walked on the earth, 
and h o w have we behaved with them? 
W h y did a m a n of the intelligence of 
Socrates have to be killed? He became intolerable. His presence became 
such an offense. To look into his eyes meant to look in the mirror. A n d 
we are so ugly that rather than accepting the fact that we are ugly, the eas-
ier course is to destroy the mirror and forget all about your ugliness, and 
start living again in the old dream that you are the most beautiful person 
in the world. 
We destroyed Socrates because he was a mirror. Hence people have 
decided it is better to remain mediocre, it is better to remain unintel-
ligent.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
Just the other day, I was reading a report. A few psychologists in E n -
gland have discovered that by the time great politicians reach the highest 
posts, their intelligence is already withering away. Just think of a m a n 
of eighty-four becoming a prime minister! Those psychologists have 
warned the w h o l e world that this is dangerous. People w h o have gone 
beyond the age of sixty, seventy, eighty, they b e c o m e prime ministers and 
presidents. This is dangerous for the world because they have so m u c h 
power and so little intelligence left. 
But those psychologists are not aware of another thing that I would 
like to tell you. In fact those people are chosen to be p r i m e ministers and 
presidents because they are no longer in-
telligent. People don't like intelligent per-
sons. People like people w h o look like 
them, w h o are like t h e m ; they feel they 
are not strangers. Intelligent people will be 
strangers. 
I 
can't 
think 
of any country that 
could choose Socrates to be the prime 
minister—impossible. He is so different, 
his approach to life is so different, his in-
sight into things is so deep. No country 
could afford it, or no country could be so 
courageous as to make h i m the prime min-
ister because he would bring chaos. He 
would start changing each and every thing, 
because each and every thing needs to be 
changed. 
This rotten society has to be destroyed 
completely; only then can a n e w society be 
created. Renovation is not going to help-
We have been renovating the same old ru-
ins for centuries. No m o r e props, no m o r e renovations, no m o r e white-
wash! All that is needed is to demolish it, and let us create a n e w society-
104

A DIFFERENT KIND OF DISOBEDIENCE 
It is important to understand what I mean by disobedience. It is n o t the 
disobedience you will find in the dictionaries. My idea of disobedience is 
not to hate being told what to do or to do just the opposite of w h a t you 
are told, in reaction. 
Obedience needs no intelligence. All machines are obedient; n o b o d y 
has ever heard of a disobedient machine. Obedience is simple, too. It 
takes from you the burden of any responsibility. There is no need to re-
act, you have simply to do what is being said. T h e responsibility rests 
with the source from where the order comes. In a certain way you are 
very free: You cannot be c o n d e m n e d for your act. 
After the Second World War, in the N u r e m b e r g trials, so m a n y of 
Adolf Hitler's top m e n simply said that they were n o t responsible, and 
they didn't feel guilty. T h e y were simply being obedient—whatever they 
were told to do, they did it, and they did it with as m u c h efficiency as 
they were capable of. In fact to make t h e m responsible and c o n d e m n 
them, punish them, to send t h e m to the gallows, according to me, was n o t 
fair. It was not justice, it was revenge. If Adolf Hitler had w o n the war, 
105 
Let us bring a n e w h u m a n being, Homo Novus. Let us give birth to some-
thing new, a n e w mind, a n e w consciousness. 
People choose dull, dead persons to be in power because you can be 
safe with them. Countries choose mediocre people to be in power b e -
cause they will save their tradition, their conventions, their prejudices. 
They will protect their poisons. Instead of destroying them, they will en-
hance them and strengthen them. 
It is certainly dangerous to have unintelligent people in powerful 
posts. A n d it is becoming m o r e and m o r e dangerous, because they have 
more and m o r e power and less and less intelligence. But w h y does it h a p -
pen? T h e r e is a subtle logic in it. People don't want to change. Change is 
arduous, change is difficult.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
then Churchill's people, Roosevelt's people, Stalin's people, or they them-
selves would have been in the same situation and they would have said 
exactly the same—that they were not responsible. 
If Stalin had been on the stand in court, he w o u l d have said that it 
was the order of the high c o m m a n d of the c o m m u n i s t party. It was not 
his responsibility because it was n o t his decision; he had n o t d o n e any-
thing on his own. So if you w a n t to punish somebody, punish the 
source of the order. But you are punishing a person w h o simply ful-
filled w h a t all the religions teach, and all the leaders of the world 
teach—obedience. 
Obedience has a simplicity; disobedience needs a little higher order 
of intelligence. Any idiot can be obedient—in fact, only idiots can be 
obedient. T h e person of intelligence is b o u n d to ask why: " W h y am I 
supposed to do it? Unless I k n o w the reasons and the consequences of it, 
I am not going to be involved in it." T h e n he is being responsible. 
Responsibility is not a game. It is one of the most authentic ways of 
living—dangerous, t o o — b u t it does not mean disobedience for disobedi-
ence's sake. That will be again idiotic. 
There is a story about a Sufi mystic, Mulla Nasruddin. From the 
very beginning it was thought that he was upside down. His 
parents were in trouble. If they would say, " G o to the right," he 
would go to the left. Finally his old father thought that rather 
than bothering with him, it w o u l d be better, if they wanted 
h i m to go to the left, to order h i m to go to the right—-he was 
b o u n d to go to the left. 
O n e day they were crossing the river. T h e y were carrying a 
big bag of sugar strapped to the donkey and the bag was leaning 
to the right, so there was a danger that it might slip into the 
river. It had to remain balanced on the donkey. But to tell N a s -
ruddin to move the bag toward the left would mean losing the 
sugar—he would move it toward the right. 
106

So the father said to Nasruddin, " M y son, your bag is slip-
ping; move it toward the right." A n d Nasruddin moved it t o -
ward the right. 
T h e father said, "This is strange, for the first time you have 
been obedient!" 
Nasruddin said, "For the first time you have been cunning. 
I k n e w you wanted this to be moved to the left; I could see with 
my eyes where it needed to be moved. Even in such a subtle way 
you cannot make me obedient." 
But just to go against obedience is not moving your intelligence 
higher. You remain on the same plane. Obedient or disobedient, but 
there is no change of intelligence. 
To me, disobedience is a great revolution. It does not mean saying an 
absolute no in every situation. It simply means deciding whether to do it 
or not, whether it is beneficial to do it or not. It is taking the responsibil-
ity on yourself. It is not a question of hating the person or hating to be 
told, because in that hating you cannot act obediently or disobediently; 
you act very unconsciously. You cannot act intelligently. 
W h e n you are told to do something, you are given an opportunity to 
respond. Perhaps what is being asked of you is right—then do it, and be 
grateful to the person w h o told you at the right m o m e n t to do it. Per-
haps it is not right—then make it clear. Bring up your reasons, w h y it is 
not right. T h e n help the person to see that what he is asking is going in 
a wrong direction. But hate has no place. If it is right, do it lovingly If it 
is not right, then even m o r e love is needed, because you will have to tell 
the person, explain to the person, that it is not right. 
T h e way of disobedience is not stagnant, just going against every or-
der and feeling anger and hate and revenge toward the person. T h e way 
of disobedience is a way of great intelligence. 
So it is not ultimately about obedience or disobedience. R e d u c e d to 
the basic fact, it is simply a question of intelligence—behave intelligently. 
107

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
108 
Sometimes you will have to obey and sometimes you will have to say, "I 
am sorry, I cannot do it." But there is no question of hate, there is no 
question of revenge, anger. If hate, anger, or revenge arises, that simply 
means you k n o w that what is being told to you is right, but it goes against 
your ego to obey it; it hurts your ego. That hurt feeling comes up as hate, 
as anger. 
But the issue is not your ego; the issue is the action that you have to 
take—and you have to bring forth your total intelligence to figure it out. 
If it is right, then be obedient; if it is wrong, be disobedient. But there is 
no conflict, there are no hurt feelings. 
If you are obeying, it is easier; you need not explain to anybody. But 
if you are not obeying, then you owe an explanation. And perhaps your 
explanation is not right. T h e n you have to move back, you have to do it. 
A person should live intelligently—that's all. T h e n whatever he does 
is his responsibility. 
It happens that even great intellectuals are not living intelligently. Mar-
tin Heidegger, one of the greatest intellectuals of this age, was a follower of 
Adolf Hitler. And after Adolf Hider's defeat and the exposure of his basic 
animality brutality, murderousness, violence, even Martin Heidegger shrank 
back and said, "I was simply following the leader of the nation." 
But a philosopher has no business following the leader of the nation. 
In fact, a philosopher's basic duty is to guide the leaders of the nation, not 
to be guided by them. Because he is outside of active politics, his vision 
should be clearer than theirs. He is standing aloof, he can see things that 
people w h o are involved in the action cannot see. 
But it is easy to throw responsibility on somebody else . . . 
If Adolf Hitler had been victorious, I am certain Martin Heidegger 
would have said, " H e is victorious because he followed my philosophy 
A n d certainly Heidegger was a great intellectual compared to Adolf 
Hitler. Adolf Hitler was just a retarded person. But power . . . 
We have been brought up to follow the powerful—the father, the 
mother, the teacher, the priest, the God. Essentially we have been told that 
whoever has the power is right: " M i g h t is right, and you have to foliow

109 
it." It is simple because it needs no intelligence. It is simple because you 
can never be held responsible, you can never be told that whatever hap-
pened was your responsibility. 
In all the armies around the world only one thing is taught through 
years of training, and that is obedience. In Germany, in the Second World 
War, there were good people—but they were heads of concentration 
camps! They were good fathers, good hus-
bands, good friends. N o b o d y could have 
conceived of it, watching t h e m with their 
families, with their friends, in the club, that 
these people were murdering thousands of 
Jews every day. A n d they were not feeling 
guilty at all, because it was only an order 
from above. That was their whole training, 
that you have to follow the order. It had 
become part of their blood and their bones 
and their marrow: W h e n the order comes, 
obedience is the only way. 
This is h o w mankind has lived up to 
now, and that's w h y I say obedience is one 
of the greatest crimes, because all other 
crimes are b o r n out of it. It deprives you 
of intelligence, it deprives you of decisive-
ness, it deprives you of responsibility. It d e -
stroys you as an individual. It converts you 
into a robot. 
Hence I am all for disobedience. But 
disobedience is not just against obedience. 
Disobedience is above obedience and the so-called disobedience described 
in the dictionaries. Disobedience is simply the assertion of your intelli-
gence: "I take the responsibility, and I will do everything that feels right 
to my heart, to my being. I will not do anything that goes against my in-
telligence."

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
My w h o l e life, from my childhood to the university, I was c o n -
d e m n e d for being disobedient. A n d I insisted, "I am not disobedient. I 
am simply trying to figure out, with my o w n intelligence, what is right, 
what should be done. A n d I take the whole responsibility for it. If some-
thing goes wrong, it was my fault. I don't want to c o n d e m n somebody 
else because he has told me to do it." But it was difficult for my parents, 
for my teachers, professors. 
In my school it was compulsory to wear caps, and I entered the high 
school without a cap. Immediately the teacher said, "Are you aware or 
not that the cap is compulsory?" 
I said, "A thing like a cap cannot be compulsory. H o w can it be 
compulsory to put something on your head? T h e head is compulsory, but 
not the cap. A n d I have come with the head; perhaps you have come only 
with the cap." 
He said, "You look a strange type. It is just written in the school code 
that without a cap, no student can enter the school." 
I said, " T h e n that code has to be changed. It is written by h u m a n be-
ings, not by God; and h u m a n beings commit mistakes." 
T h e teacher could not believe it. He said, " W h a t is the matter with 
you? W h y can't you just wear a cap?" 
I said, " T h e trouble is not with the cap; I want to find out w h y it is 
compulsory, its reason, its results. If you are unable to explain it, you can 
take me to the principal and we can discuss it." He had to take me to the 
principal. 
In India, Bengalis are the most intelligent people; they don't wear 
caps. And Punjabis are the most unintelligent, simple people, and they wear 
turbans. So I said to the principal, "Looking at the situation—Bengalis 
don't wear any caps and they are the most intelligent people in the coun-
try, and Punjabis wear not only a cap but a very tight turban, and they are 
the most unintelligent people. If it really has something to do with your 
intelligence, I would rather not take the risk." 
T h e principal listened to me and he said, " T h e boy is stubborn, but 
what he is saying makes sense. I had never thought about it—this is true. 
no

And we can make this code noncompulsory. Anybody w h o wants to 
wear a cap can wear one; anybody w h o does not want to, there is no 
need—because it has nothing to do with learning." 
T h e teacher could not believe it. On the way back he asked me, 
" W h a t did you do?" 
I said, "I have done nothing, I simply explained the situation. I am 
not angry, I am perfectly willing to wear a cap. If you feel it helps intelli-
gence, w h y only one? I can wear t w o caps, three caps, caps u p o n caps, if 
it helps my intelligence . . . I am not angry. But you have to prove the 
value of it." 
T h e teacher said to me, I still remember his words, "You will be in 
trouble your whole life. You will not fit in anywhere." 
I said, "That's perfectly okay, but I don't want to be an idiot and fit in 
everywhere. It is good to be 'unfit' but intelligent. A n d I have come to the 
school to learn intelligence, so I can be a misfit intelligently! Please never 
try again to change me from an individual into a cog in the machine." 
A n d from the next day the caps disappeared; only the teacher had • 
come with a cap. A n d looking at the class and around the school. . . 
because the new rule had come into force that caps were not compulsory, 
and all the other teachers, even the principal, had come without caps. He 
looked so silly. I said to him, " T h e r e is still time. You can take it off and 
put it in your pocket." A n d he did! 
He said, "That's right. If everybody is against the cap . . . I was sim-
ply being obedient to the law." 
So remember, w h e n I talk about disobedience I don't mean replacing 
obedience with disobedience. That will not make you better. I use the 
word disobedience only to make it clear to you that it is up to you, that you 
have to be the decisive factor in all your actions in hfe. A n d that gives 
tremendous strength, because whatever you do, you do with a certain ra-
tional support to it. 
Just live intelligently. 
If something is told to you, decide whether it is right or wrong. T h e n 
you can avoid all guilt Feelings. Otherwise, if you don't do it, you feel 
111

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
112 
guilty; if you do it, again you fee) guilty. If you do it you feel that you are 
being subservient, that you are not being assertive, that you are not being 
yourself. A n d if you don't do it, then you start feeling guilty again— 
because perhaps it was the right thing to do, and you are not doing it. 
T h e r e is no need for all this clumsiness. Just be simple. If something 
is asked of you, respond intelligently. A n d whatever your intelligence de-
cides, do it this way or that—but you are responsible. T h e n there is no 
question of guilt. 
If you are not going to do it, explain to the person w h y you are not 
going to do it. A n d explain without any anger, because anger simply 
shows that you are weak, that you don't really have an intelligent answer. 
Anger is always a sign of weakness. Just plainly and simply explain the 
whole thing; perhaps the other person may find that you are right and 
may be grateful to you. Or perhaps the other person may have better rea-
sons than you; then you will be thankful to the other person because he 
has raised your consciousness. 
Use every opportunity in life for raising your intelligence, your con-
sciousness. 
Ordinarily what we are doing is using every opportunity to create a 
hell for ourselves. O n l y you suffer, and because of your suffering, you 
make others suffer. A n d w h e n so many people are living together, if they 
all create suffering for each other, it goes on multiplying. That's h o w the 
whole world has b e c o m e a hell. 
It can be instantly changed. 
Just the basic thing has to be understood, that without intelligence 
there is no heaven. 
THE I N T E L L I G E N C E O F I N N O C E N C E 
A child is pure intelligence because a child is yet uncontaminated. A child 
is a clean slate, nothing is written on him. A child is absolute emptiness, 
tabula rasa.

113 
T h e society will start writing immediately that you are a Christian, 
Catholic, Hindu, M o h a m m e d a n , C o m m u n i s t . T h e society will i m m e d i -
ately start writing the Bhagavadgita, the Koran, the Bible on you. T h e so-
ciety cannot wait. T h e society is very m u c h afraid that if the child's 
intelligence is left intact, then he will never be a part of any slavery, of 
any structure of domination. He will neither dominate nor be d o m i -
nated. He will neither possess n o r be possessed. He will be a pure rebel-
lion. His innocence has to be corrupted immediately. His wings have to 
be cut, he has to be given crutches to lean u p o n so he never learns h o w 
to walk on his o w n feet, so he remains always in a kind of dependence. 
First the children are dependent on the parents, and the parents enjoy 
it very m u c h . Whenever children are dependent, parents feel very good. 
Their life starts having some meaning: They k n o w that they are helping 
some n e w people to grow up, some beautiful people to grow up. T h e y 
are not meaningless. T h e y have a vicarious enjoyment of being creative. 
It is not true creativity, but at least they can say that they are doing some-
thing, they are occupied. T h e y can forget their o w n problems in the anx-
iety of bringing up 
the children. A n d the m o r e the children are 
dependent on them, the m o r e happy they feel. Although on the surface 
they go on saying they would like their children to be independent, that 
is only on the surface. A really independent child hurts the parents. T h e y 
don't like the independent child because the independent child has no 
need of them. 
That is one of the big problems the older generation is facing today: 
Children in the m o d e r n age are not dependent on them, and because 
they are not dependent you cannot force things u p o n them. You cannot 
tell them what to do and what not to do, you cannot be their masters. 
The old generation is suffering very much. For the first time in h u m a n 
history the old generation is feeling utterly empty, meaningless, because 
their whole occupation is gone, and their joy in bringing up children is 
shattered. In fact they are feeling guilty, afraid that they may be destroy-
ing the children. W h o knows? W h a t they are doing may n o t be the right 
thing.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
Parents destroy the intelligence of the children because that is the 
only way to enslave them; then the teachers, school, college, university do 
the same. N o b o d y wants a rebel, and intelligence is rebellion. N o b o d y 
wants to be questioned, nobody wants his authority to be questioned, and 
intelligence is questioning. Intelligence is pure doubt. Yes, one day out of 
this pure doubt arises trust, but not against doubt; it arises only through 
doubt. 
Trust comes out of doubt as a child comes out of the mother's 
w o m b . D o u b t is the m o t h e r of trust. T h e real trust comes only through 
doubt, questioning, inquiring. And the 
false 
trust, w h i c h 
we 
k n o w 
as 
belief, 
comes by killing the doubt, by destroying 
questioning, by destroying all quest, in-
quiry, search, by 
giving people 
ready-
m a d e truths. 
T h e 
politician is not interested in 
children's intelligence, because leaders are 
leaders only because people are stupid. 
A n d w h e n people are so stupid, they will 
find stupid leaders. People are so unintelli-
gent that they will be ready to fall into the 
trap of anybody w h o can pretend to lead 
them. 
Children are b o r n with pure intelli-
gence, and we have n o t yet been able to re-
spect it. Children are the most exploited 
class in the world, even more than women. 
After women's liberation sooner or later 
there is going to be children's liberation; it is far m o r e necessary. Men 
have enslaved w o m e n , and m e n and w o m e n both have enslaved the chil-
dren. A n d because the child is very helpless, naturally he has to depend 
on you. It is very mean of you to exploit the child's helplessness. But 
hitherto parents have been mean. A n d I am not saying that deliberately or 
114

115 
consciously they have been so, but almost unconsciously, not k n o w i n g 
what they are doing. That's w h y the world is in such a misery, the world 
is in such a mess. Unconsciously, unknowingly, every generation goes on 
destroying the next generation. 
This is the first generation w h i c h is trying to escape out of the trap 
and this is the beginning of a totally new history. But children certainly are 
utterly intelligent. You just watch children, look into their eyes, look at 
the way they respond. 
Little Papo seemed to be enjoying himself thoroughly at the 
zoo with his father. As they were looking at the lions, however, a 
troubled look came over the boy's face and his father asked h i m 
what the matter was. "I was just wondering, daddy . . . In case a 
lion breaks loose and eats you, what n u m b e r bus do I take home? 
Just watch children, be m o r e observant. 
A teacher asked her class of small children to make a draw-
ing of the O l d Testament story they liked best. O n e small boy 
depicted a m a n driving an old car. In the back seat were two 
passengers, both scantily dressed. "It is a nice picture," said the 
teacher. "But what story does it tell?" 
T h e y o u n g artist seemed surprised at the question. "Well," 
he exclaimed. "Doesn't it say in the Bible that G o d drove A d a m 
and Eve out of the Garden of E d e n ? " 
No proof of their intelligence is needed! Just look around—children 
are everywhere, just watch. 
Another story I have heard . . . 
In another school the teacher had asked the children the 
same question: to make some pictures of any story that they 
liked. This child made an airplane instead of a car. T h e airplane

had four windows. From one w i n d o w G o d the Father was look-
ing out, from the other, the H o l y Ghost, from the third, Jesus 
Christ. But the teacher was puzzled, and asked, "These three I 
can understand, but w h o is this fourth?" 
T h e child said, "That is Pontius the Pilot!" 
But nobody watches children. In fact, everybody thinks they are just 
a nuisance. T h e y should not be heard, they should only be seen; that has 
been the dictum d o w n the ages. W h o cares what they ask? W h o cares 
what they say? W h o listens? 
A child came running h o m e panting and breathing hard, 
and told his mother, "Listen to what happened! A tiger chased 
me from the school up to the house! S o m e h o w I managed; I had 
to run so hard!" 
T h e mother said, "Listen, I have told you millions of times 
not to exaggerate—millions of times not to exaggerate! A n d here 
you go again! You found a tiger in the street? W h e r e is the tiger?" 
He said, "You can look out of the window, he is standing 
there." 
A small dog! 
T h e m o t h e r looked and said, "This is a tiger? You k n o w 
perfectly well that this is a dog! You go up and pray to God, and 
ask for forgiveness!" 
So the child left. After a few minutes he came back. A n d the 
m o t h e r said, "You prayed? You asked G o d ? " 
He said, "Yes! I said, ' G o d forgive me! It was totally w r o n g 
of me to think of that little dog as a tiger.' A n d G o d said, 'Don't 
be worried! W h e n I first saw him, I also thought that he was a 
tiger!'" 
Children have immense intelligence but d o w n the ages they have not 
been allowed to develop it.

We have to create a n e w kind of education in which nothing is i m -
posed on the children, but where they are helped to strengthen their nat-
ural, God-given intelligence. They are not to be stuffed with information 
which is in fact almost useless. N i n e t y -
eight percent of the information that we 
go on throwing into children's minds is 
just stupid, foolish. But because of that 
load, that baggage, the child will never be 
free of the burden. 
I have been a professor in the u n i -
versity, and I have been a student from 
primary school to university. My o w n o b -
servation is that ninety-eight percent of 
the information that we go on throwing 
on children is utterly futile; it is not needed 
at all. And not only is it futile, it is harmful, 
positively harmful. 
Children should be helped to be m o r e 
inventive, not repetitive, w h i c h is what our 
education is based on right now. 
O u r 
whole educational system is geared to rep-
etition. If a child can repeat better than others, then he is thought to be 
more intelligent. In fact he only has a better memory, not better intelli-
gence. It almost always happens that the m a n with a very good m e m o r y 
may not have very good intelligence, and vice versa. 
Albert Einstein didn't have a very good memory. N e w t o n , Edison, 
and so many m o r e great inventors were really very forgetful of things. 
But our whole educational system is centered on memory, n o t intel-
ligence. Stuff m o r e and m o r e information in the memory, make the m a n 
a machine! O u r universities are factories where m e n are reduced to m a -
chines. Twenty-five years are wasted—one-third of your life—in making 
You a machine! A n d then it becomes really difficult to u n w i n d you again, 
to make you a human being again. 
117

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
That is my work. You come as machines, very uptight, full of m e m -
ories, information, knowledgeability absolutely in the head, h u n g up 
there. You have lost all contact with your heart and your being. To pull 
you d o w n toward the heart and then toward the being is really a difficult 
task. But in a better world this will n o t be needed. Education should 
help people to b e c o m e m o r e and m o r e intelligent, not m o r e and more 
repetitive. R i g h t n o w it is repetition: You cram into your head whatso-
ever nonsense is told to you, and then you regurgitate it in the examina-
tion papers—and the better you vomit the better marks you get. There 
is only one thing that you have to remember: to be exactly repetitive. 
D o n ' t add anything, don't delete anything, don't be inventive, don't be 
original. 
Originality is killed, repetitiveness praised. A n d intelligence can grow 
only in the atmosphere where originality is praised. 
Innocence is your very nature. You do not have to become it, you are al-
ready it. You are b o r n innocent. T h e n layers and layers of conditioning 
are imposed u p o n your innocence. Your innocence is like a mirror and 
conditioning is like layers of dust. T h e mirror has not to be achieved, the 
mirror is already there—or rather, here. T h e mirror is not lost, it is only 
hidden behind the layers of dust. 
You don't have to follow a way to reach your nature because you 
cannot leave your nature, you cannot go anywhere else. Even if you 
wanted to, it is impossible. That's exactly the definition of nature: Nature 
means that w h i c h cannot be left behind, that w h i c h cannot be re-
nounced. But you can forget about it. You cannot lose it but it can be 
forgotten. 
A n d that's exactly what has happened. T h e mirror is not lost but 
forgotten—forgotten because it is not functioning anymore as a mirror-
N o t that any defect has arisen in it, just layers of dust are covering it- All 
that is needed is to clean it, to remove those layers of dust. 
T h e process of becoming innocent is not really a process of becoming,

Madame Curie was working on a certain mathematical problem for three 
years continuously and the m o r e she tried, the farther and farther away 
he solution seemed. She tried every possible way, but nothing was w o r k -
nothing was happening. A n d there was somewhere a deep, tacit feei-
ng that "the solution exists. I am not struggling with something absurd." 
"his tacit feeling continued all the time as an undercurrent; hence she 
could not drop the effort, either. She was getting tired—three years 
119 
it is a process of discovering your being. It is a discovery, not an achieve-
ment. You don't attain to something new, you simply attain to that which 
you have always been. It is a forgotten language. 
It happens m a n y times: You see a person on the road, you recognize 
him, his face seems familiar. Suddenly you r e m e m b e r also that you 
k n o w his name. You say, "It is just on the tip of my tongue," but still it 
is not c o m i n g to you. W h a t is happening? If it is just on the tip of your 
tongue, then w h y can't you say it? You k n o w that you k n o w it, but still 
you are not able to r e m e m b e r it. A n d the m o r e you try, the m o r e diffi-
:ult it becomes, because m a k i n g an effort makes you m o r e tense, and 
when you are tense you are farther away from your nature, you are 
farther away from that w h i c h is already there. W h e n you are relaxed 
you are closer; w h e n you are utterly relaxed, it will surface of its o w n 
accord. 
So you try hard, but it doesn't come, so you forget all about it. T h e n 
lying d o w n in your bath, or just swimming in the pool, you are not even 
trying to remember that man's name w h e n suddenly it bubbles up. W h a t 
has happened? You were not trying to remember, and you were relaxed, 
When you are relaxed you are wide, w h e n you are tense you become 
narrow—the m o r e tense, the more narrow. T h e passage between you and 
that w h i c h is inside you becomes so narrow that nothing can pass 
through it, not even a single name. 
All the great scientific discoveries have been made in this very mys-
terious w a y — i n this very unscientific way, so to speak.

wasted for a single problem. But deep down within herself somebody 
was saying, " T h e solution IS possible. This exercise is not futile. Go on." 
A n d she w e n t on stubbornly, she persisted. She dropped all other proj-
ects, she forced herself totally into the one problem. But the m o r e she 
tried, the more impossible it became. 
O n e night it happened, almost as it happened to Gautama the Bud-
dha; of course, the problems were different, but the process was the same. 
Buddha had struggled for six years to attain enlightenment and he had at-
tained nothing. T h e n one night he dropped the w h o l e effort, w e n t to 
sleep, and, by the m o r n i n g w h e n the last star was setting, he became en-
lightened. 
That night M a d a m e Curie dropped the idea, the w h o l e project—she 
closed the chapter. " E n o u g h is enough! Three years wasted is too much 
for one problem." T h e r e were other problems w h i c h were waiting to be 
solved. It was finished in her mind, although the tacit understanding was 
still there just like a constant murmur. But she had followed it long 
enough, it was time. O n e has only a limited time; three years is too much 
for one problem. Deliberately she dropped the idea. As far as she was 
concerned she closed the whole project. She w e n t to sleep never to be 
bothered by that problem again. 
A n d in the m o r n i n g w h e n she got up she was surprised. On a piece 
of paper on her table, the solution was there, written in her own hand-
writing. She could not believe her eyes. W h o had done it? T h e servant 
could n o t have done it—he k n e w nothing of mathematics, and if 
M a d a m e Curie had not been able to do it in three years, h o w could the 
servant have done it? A n d there was nobody else in the house. And the 
servant had not entered in the night—the doors were locked from inside. 
She looked closely and the handwriting resembled hers. 
T h e n suddenly she remembered a dream. In the dream she had seen 
that she had got up, gone to the table, written something . . . Slowly, 
slowly, the dream became clear. Slowly, slowly, she remembered that she 
had done it in the night. It was not a dream, she had actually done it. And 
this was the solution! For three years she had been struggling hard and

nothing was happening—and the night she dropped the project, it hap-
pened. W h a t happened? She became relaxed. 
121 
I 
O n c e you have dropped the effort you become relaxed, you b e c o m e rest-
ful, you become soft, you b e c o m e wide, you become open. It was there 
inside her, it surfaced. Finding the m i n d no longer tense, it surfaced. 
Innocence is there, you have simply forgotten it—you have been 
made to forget it. Society is cunning. For centuries m a n has learned that 
you can survive in this society only if you are cunning; the m o r e cunning 
you are, the m o r e successful you will be. That's the w h o l e game of poli-
tics: Be cunning, be m o r e cunning than others. It is a constant struggle 
and competition as to w h o can be m o r e cunning. Whosoever is m o r e 
cunning is going to succeed, is going to be 
powerful. 
After centuries of cunningness m a n 
has learned one thing: that to remain i n n o -
cent is dangerous, you will not be able to 
survive. Hence parents try to drive their 
children out of their innocence. Teachers, 
schools, colleges, universities exist for the 
simple w o r k of making you m o r e c u n -
ning, more clever. Although they call it 
intelligence it is not intelligence. 
Intelligence is not against innocence, 
member. Intelligence is the flavor of 
innocence, intelligence is the fragrance of 
'innocence. Cunningness is against i n n o -
cence; and cunningness, cleverness, are not 
synonymous with intelligence. But to be 
intelligent needs a tremendous j o u r n e y in-
ward. No schools can help, no colleges, no universities can help. Parents, 
Priests, the society, they are all extroverted; they cannot help you to go 
tellij

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
inward. A n d buddhas are very rare, few and far between. N o t everybody 
is fortunate enough to find a buddha. O n l y a buddha can help you to be 
an intelligent person, but you cannot find so many buddhas w h o want to 
become primary school teachers and high school teachers and university 
professors; it is impossible. 
So there is a substitute for intelligence. Cunningness is a substitute 
for intelligence—a very poor substitute, remember. A n d not only is it a 
poor substitute, it is just the opposite of it, 
too. T h e intelligent person is not cunning; 
certainly intelligent, but his intelligence 
keeps his innocence intact. He does not 
sell it for m u n d a n e things. T h e cunning 
person is ready to sell his soul for small 
things. 
Judas sold Jesus for only thirty silver 
coins—just thirty silver coins. A n d a Jesus 
can be sold. Judas must have thought that 
he was being very intelligent, but he was 
simply cunning. 
If you don't like the 
w o r d cunning you can call h i m clever; that 
is just a good name for the same thing, for 
the same ugly thing. 
T h e society prepares you to be cun-
ning so that you are capable of competing 
in this struggle for existence, the struggle to survive. It is a cutthroat com-
petition, everybody is after everybody else's throat. People are ready to 
do anything to succeed, to be famous, to climb the ladder of success, 
name and fame. T h e y are ready to use you as stepping-stones. Unless you 
are also cunning you will be simply used, manipulated. Hence the society 
trains every child to be cunning, and these layers of cunningness are hid-
ing your innocence. 
Innocence has not to be achieved, it is already there. Hence it is not 
a question of becoming, it is your being. It has only to be discovered—or 
122

THE GIFT OF BEING ALIVE 
you have never been accepted by your parents, teachers, neighbors, soci-
ety, as you are. Everybody was trying to improve u p o n you, to make you 
better. Everybody was pointing at the flaws, at the mistakes, at the errors, 
at the weaknesses, at the frailties that every h u m a n being is prone to. 
rediscovered. You have to drop all that you have learned from others, and 
you will immediately be innocent. 
Hence my antagonism toward all knowledge that is borrowed. D o n ' t 
quote the Bible, don't quote the Gita. D o n ' t behave like parrots. D o n ' t 
just go on living on borrowed information. Start seeking and searching 
for your o w n intelligence. 
A negative process is needed; it is to be achieved through via negativa. 
That is the Buddha's way. You have to negate all that has been given to 
you. You have to say, "This is not mine; hence I have no claim over it. It 
may be true, it may not be true. W h o knows? Others say it is so; unless it 
becomes my experience I cannot agree or disagree. I will not believe or 
disbelieve. I will not be a Catholic or a communist, I will not be a H i n d u 
or a M o h a m m e d a n . I will simply not follow any ideology." Because, 
whoever you follow, you will be gathering dust around yourself. Stop fol-
lowing. 
[. . .]My w o r k is not to teach you something, but to help you to dis-
cover yourself. Just drop all knowledge. It hurts because you have carried 
that knowledge for so long and you have been bragging so m u c h about 
that knowledge—your degrees, M.A.s and Ph.D.s and D.Litt.s, and you 
have been bragging about, all those degrees. A n d suddenly I am saying to 
you: D r o p all that nonsense. 
Just be as simple as a child. Just be again a child as you were born, as 
God sent you into this world. In that mirrorlike state you will be able to 
reflect that w h i c h is. Innocence is the door to knowing. Knowledge is 
the barrier and innocence is the bridge.

N o b o d y emphasized your beauty, n o b o d y emphasized your intelligence, 
nobody emphasized your grandeur. 
Just being alive is such a gift, but n o b o d y ever told you to be thank-
ful to existence. On the contrary, everyone was grumpy, complaining. 
Naturally, if everything surrounding your life from the very beginning 
goes on pointing out to you that you are n o t w h a t you should be, goes 
on giving you great ideals that you have to follow and you have to 
become . . . Your isness is never praised. W h a t is praised is your future— 
if you can b e c o m e someone respectable, powerful, rich, intellectual, in 
some way famous, n o t just a nobody. 
Constant conditioning against you has created in you the idea, "I am 
n o t enough as I am, something is missing. A n d I have to be somewhere 
else—not here. This is not the place I am supposed to be, but somewhere 
higher, m o r e powerful, more dominant, m o r e respected, m o r e well 
known." 
Your head, your mind, has been turned in m a n y ways by m a n y peo-
ple according to their ideas of h o w you should be. There was not any bad 
intention. Your parents loved you, your teachers loved you, your society 
wants you to be somebody. Their intentions were good, but their under-
standing was very limited. T h e y forgot that you cannot manage to make 
a marigold into a rose flower, or vice versa. 
All that you can do is help the roses to grow bigger, m o r e colorful, 
m o r e fragrant. You can give all the elements that are needed to transform 
the color and the fragrance—the manure that is needed, the right soil, the 
right watering at the right times—but you cannot make the rosebush 
produce lotuses. A n d if you start giving the idea to the rosebush, "You 
have to produce lotus flowers"—and of course the lotus flowers are beau-
tiful and big—you are giving a w r o n g conditioning. N o t only will this 
bush never be able to produce lotuses; its w h o l e energy will be directed 
on a w r o n g path so it will not produce even roses, because from where 
will it get the energy to produce roses? A n d w h e n it turns out that there 
are no lotuses, no roses, of course this poor bush will feel continuously 
empty, frustrated, barren, unworthy.

D I S C O V E R I N G THE "OFF" SWITCH 
Create a little distance. Watch the mind, h o w it functions, and create the 
distance. Watching automatically creates distance. Hence again and again 
the buddhas insist—watch. Watch day and night. Slowly, you will begin 
to see that you are consciousness and the m i n d is just an instrument avail-
able to you. T h e n you can use it w h e n needed and w h e n it is not needed 
you can switch it off. R i g h t now, you don't k n o w h o w to switch it off; it 
is always on. It is like a radio in your r o o m that is always on and you don't 
snow h o w to t u r n it off—so you have to sleep with the radio on, and 
goes on shouting all kinds of advertisements and playing all kinds of 
songs that you have heard a thousand times. But you don't k n o w h o w to 
turn it off. T h e whole day you are tired, many times you want to get rid 
125 
This is what is happening to h u m a n beings. W i t h all good inten-
tions, people are turning your mind. In a 
better society, with m o r e understanding 
people, n o b o d y will try to change you. 
Everybody will help you to be yourself— 
and to be oneself is the richest thing in the 
world. To be oneself gives you all that you 
need to feel fulfilled, all that can make 
your life meaningful, significant. Just being 
yourself and growing according to your 
nature will bring the fulfillment of your 
destiny. 
This is real richness. This is real power. 
If everybody grows to be himself, you 
will find the w h o l e earth full of powerful 
people, of tremendous 
strength, intelli-
gence, understanding, and a fulfillment, a 
joy that they have come h o m e .

of the noise of the radio, but you cannot because you don't k n o w h o w to 
turn it off. It is like sleeping with the lights on because you don't k n o w 
h o w to turn t h e m off. 
Freud remembers that w h e n electricity came to Vienna for the first 
time, a friend, a villager, came to visit him. Freud took every care of the 
visitor, took h i m to the room where he was going to sleep, left h i m there, 
and said good night. 
T h e villager was very puzzled by just one thing—the electricity, the 
electric bulb. He k n e w h o w to put out a lamp, h o w to blow a candle out, 
but what to do with this electric bulb? He tried all that he knew: standing 
on a chair, he blew on it many times but nothing would happen to it. He 
examined it from every angle; there was no hole in it, there was nothing. 
H o w could he imagine that just on the wall there was a switch? That 
was impossible for h i m to imagine, he had never seen electricity. But he 
was also afraid to go and ask Freud or somebody else, because they would 
think he was a fool. . . "You can't even put the light o u t — w h a t kind of 
m a n are you?" So, feeling embarrassed, he tried to sleep with the light on. 
He could not sleep. M a n y times he stood up again on the chair, tried 
again. T h e w h o l e night it continued; sleep wouldn't come because of the 
light—too m u c h light, such a bright light, he had never seen such a 
bright light. He had k n o w n candles, but the bulb must have sent the light 
of a hundred candles or more into the room. In the m o r n i n g he was dead 
tired. 
Freud asked him, "You look very tired. Couldn't you sleep?" 
He said, " N o w there is no point in hiding it, because I am going to 
stay three days—this bulb is going to kill me! Even to look at it makes a 
shiver go up my spine. H o w to turn it off?" 
Freud said, "You fool! W h y didn't you ask m e ? " 
He said, "I was just feeling embarrassed—so foolish to ask such a 
simple thing!" 
Freud took h i m to the wall, showed h i m the switch. He tried it, 
turned it on and off, and laughed. A n d he said, "Such a simple thing, and 
the w h o l e night I tried and could not find it!"

He could have tried his w h o l e life and might have never connected 
the switch with the light. 
This is h o w it is happening to you; your m i n d is continuously on. T h e y 
say that the m i n d is such a magnificent mechanism that it starts working 
the m o m e n t you are b o r n and it goes on working till you stand before an 
audience—then suddenly it stops, then something happens to it. O t h e r -
wise it continues till you die. And very few 
people need to stand before an audience, 
so the m i n d continues unhindered and it 
keeps you utterly tired, exhausted, weary, 
bored. A n d it goes on saying the same 
things again and again. 
W h y are people so bored? Life is not 
boring, remember. Life is always a tremen-
dous mystery, it is always a surprise, it is al-
ways new, it is constantly renewing itself. 
N e w leaves are coming, old leaves are 
falling; n e w flowers are 
appearing, old 
flowers disappearing. But you cannot see 
life because you are constantly bored by 
your o w n mind. It goes on saying things it 
has said thousands of times. You look so 
tired, for the simple reason that you don't 
know h o w to switch it off. 
T h e m i n d has not to be thrown out, 
the m i n d has to be put in its place. It is a 
beautiful servant but a very ugly master. 
Take 
the 
reins 
in your hands, be 
the 
master—and the first act, the first step, is to 
become detached from the mind. See that it is not you, create the dis-
tance; the greater the distance the greater is the ability to turn it off.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
A n d one m o r e miracle you will be corning across is that w h e n you 
turn the m i n d off, the m i n d becomes fresher and m o r e intelligent. Just 
think: F r o m the day you are b o r n the m i n d starts and it goes on w o r k -
ing till you d i e — a n d one never knows, it may even be working w h e n 
you are in the grave, because a few things continue to happen then. Nails 
go on growing even w h e n you are in the grave, hair goes on growing, so 
some kind of mechanism still continues. Even in a dead body the nails 
and hair go on growing, so something is still working. Maybe there is 
some local mechanism, not the m i n d itself, but maybe the body has small, 
local minds to support the big mind—like agents of the big mind. Maybe 
these small agents have not yet come to k n o w that the big guy is dead and 
they go on doing the old thing! T h e y k n o w nothing else so they continue 
to repeat their old job. Hairs go on growing, nails go on growing—and 
just small, local minds, miniminds! 
T h e mind has to be put in its right place, and be used only w h e n you 
need it. Just as you use your legs w h e n you need t h e m — w h e n you don't 
need to, you don't use your legs. If you are sitting in a chair and you go on 
moving your legs up and down, then people will think you are mad. That's 
exactly what is happening in the mind, and still you think you are not mad? 
A meditative awareness comes to k n o w the key. W h e n e v e r it wants 
to turn the m i n d off it simply says, " N o w shut up," and that's it. The 
m i n d simply keeps quiet and great silence prevails inside. A n d the mind 
can also rest in those moments; otherwise everything becomes tired. 
Everything tires, everything gets tired—even metals get tired. And 
your m i n d is made of very delicate tissues, so delicate that there is noth-
ing m o r e delicate in the w h o l e of existence. In your small skull, millions 
of small fibers are functioning. They are so thin that your hairs, when 
compared with the nerves that function in your brain, are very thick, 
hundreds of thousands of times thicker. Such a delicate phenomenon, 
but we don't k n o w h o w to use it. It needs rest. 
H e n c e a meditative person becomes m o r e intelligent, he becomes 
saner. Whatever he does there is an art in it. Whatever he touches,is 
transformed into gold.

Simplicity is to live without ideals. Ideals create complexity; ideals create 
division in you and hence complexity. T h e m o m e n t you are interested in 
becoming somebody else you b e c o m e complex. To be contented with 
yourself as you are is simplicity. T h e future brings complexity; w h e n you 
are utterly in the present you are simple. 
Simplicity does not mean to live a life of poverty. That is utterly stu-
jid because the person w h o imposes a life of poverty on himself is n o t 
simple at all. He is a hypocrite. T h e need to impose poverty means, deep 
down, he hankers for the diametrically opposite; otherwise w h y should 
there be any need to impose it? You impose a certain character u p o n 
yourself because you are just the opposite of it. 
T h e angry person wants to b e c o m e compassionate; the violent per-
on wants to become nonviolent. If you are nonviolent you will not try 
to become nonviolent. For what? T h e person w h o imposes poverty u p o n 
himself is simply trying to live out a life according to others, n o t accord-
ng to his o w n innermost core, not according to his o w n spontaneity. 
And to live according to others is never to be simple. 
To live according to others means to live a life of imitation. It will be 
a plastic life: You will be one thing on the surface and just the opposite of 
it in your depths. A n d only the depths matter, the surface never matters. 
You will be a saint on the surface and a sinner deep down. A n d that's 
what is going to be decisive about you because G o d is only in contact 
With your depth, not with your surface. 
T h e surface is in contact with the society, the existence is in contact 
With the depth. T h e existence only knows what you are, it never knows 
What you are pretending. T h e existence never knows about your acts. 
M i n d is a blessing with meditation, otherwise it is a curse. A d d m e d -
itation to your being and the curse disappears, and the curse itself be-
comes the blessing; it is a blessing in disguise.

N T E L L I G E N C E 
130 
You may be pretending to be a great saint, a mahatma, but existence will 
never k n o w about it, because it never knows about anything false. Any-
thing false happens out of existence. It knows only the real, the real you. 
Simplicity means to be just yourself, whosoever you are, in tremen-
dous acceptance, with no goal, with no ideal. All ideals are crap—scrap all 
of them. 
It needs guts to be simple. It needs guts because you will be in con-
stant rebellion. It needs guts because you will never be adjusted to the 
so-called rotten society that exists around 
you. You will constantly be an outsider. 
But you will be simple, and simplicity has 
beauty. You will be utterly in harmony 
with yourself. T h e r e will be no conflict 
within you, there will be no split within 
you. 
T h e ideal brings the split. T h e bigger 
the ideal, the bigger is going to be the split. 
T h e ideal means somewhere in the future 
one day, maybe in this life or another life, 
you will be a great saint. Meanwhile you 
are a sinner. It helps you to go on hoping; 
it helps you to go on believing in the sur-
face, that t o m o r r o w everything will be 
okay, that t o m o r r o w you will be as you 
should be. T h e today can be tolerated. You 
can ignore it, you need not note it, you 
need n o t take any notice of it. T h e real thing is going to be tomorrow. 
But the t o m o r r o w never comes. It is always today . . . it is always to-
day. 
A n d the person w h o lives in ideals goes on missing reality because 
reality is now, here. To be n o w and to be here is to be simple: to be like 
trees, herenow, to be like clouds, herenow, to be like birds, herenow 
"to 
be like buddhas, herenow. T h e ideal needs the future. Simplicity is not an

131 
ideal. People have made an ideal out of simplicity, too; such is h u m a n 
stupidity. 
Simplicity can never be an ideal, because no ideal can create simplic-
ity. It is the ideal w h i c h poisons you and makes you complex, divides 
you, makes two persons in y o u — t h e one that you are and the one that 
you would like to be. N o w there is going to be a constant war, a civil war. 
A n d w h e n you are fighting with yourself—the violent person trying 
to be nonviolent, the ugly person trying to be beautiful, and so on, so 
f o r t h — w h e n you are constantly trying, endeavoring to be something 
that you are not, your energy is dissipated in that conflict, your energy 
goes on leaking. A n d energy is delight. A n d to have energy is to be alive, 
to be fresh, to be young. 
Look at people's faces, h o w dull they appear. Look into their eyes, their 
eyes have lost all luster and all depth. Feel their presence and you will not 
feel any radiance, you will not feel any energy streaming from them. On 
the contrary you will feel as if they are sucking you. Rather then over-
flowing with energy, they have become black holes: They suck you, they 
exploit your energy. Being with them you will become poorer. That's w h y 
when you go into a crowd and come back you feel tired, weary, you feel 
exhausted, you need rest. Why? W h y after being in a crowd do you feel as 
if you have lost something? You certainly lose something, because the 
crowd consists of black holes. A n d the more unintelligent the crowd is, the 
more of a m o b it is, the more you will feel exhausted. 
That's w h y w h e n you are alone, sitting silently, not with anybody— 
in a tremendous celibate state, just a l o n e — o n e becomes replenished, reju-
venated. That's w h y meditation makes you younger, makes you livelier. 
You start sharing something with existence. Your energy is frozen no 
more; it starts flowing. You are in a kind of dance, as stars are. A song 
arises in you. 
But in the crowd you always lose. In meditation you always gain, 
why? W h a t happens in meditation? In meditation you become simple: 
The future is your concern no more. That's what meditation is all about: 
dropping the concern with past and future, being herenow. O n l y this

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
m o m e n t exists. A n d whenever it happens, whenever only this m o m e n t 
exists—watching a sunrise, or looking at a white cloud floating in the 
sky, or just being with a tree, silently 
c o m m u n i n g , or observing a bird on the 
w i n g — w h e n e v e r you forget all about past 
and future and the present m o m e n t takes 
possession of you, w h e n you are utterly 
possessed by this m o m e n t , you will feel re-
juvenated. W h y ? T h e split disappears, the 
split created by the ideals. You are one in 
that m o m e n t , integrated; you are all to-
gether. 
Simplicity is not an ideal; you cannot 
impose simplicity on yourself. That's why 
I 
never say 
that people like Mahatma 
Gandhi are simple. T h e y are not, they can-
n o t be. Simplicity is their ideal, they are 
trying to attain it. Simplicity is a goal far 
away in the future, distant, and they are 
striving, they are straining, they are in great 
effort. H o w can you create simplicity out 
of effort? Simplicity simply means that 
w h i c h is. O u t of effort you are trying to 
improve u p o n existence. 
Existence is perfect as it is, it needs no 
improvement. T h e so-called saints go on 
constantly improving upon themselves— 
drop this, drop that, repress this, impose that, this is not good, that is 
good . . . Continuous effort, and in this very effort they are lost. 
Simplicity is a state of effortlessness; it is humbleness—not the hum-
bleness created against arrogance, not humbleness created against the 
ego, not humbleness opposite to the proud mind. N o , humbleness is not 
opposite to pride. Humbleness is simply absence of pride. Try to see the 
132

point. If your humbleness is against your pride, if you have strived to 
drop your pride, your ego, your arrogance, then what you have done is 
only repression. N o w you will b e c o m e proud about your humbleness; 
n o w you will start bragging, h o w humble you are. This is what happens. 
Just see the so-called humble people—they are constantly broadcasting 
that they are humble. 
T h e really humble people will not k n o w that they are humble; h o w 
can they then brag about it? H o w can the humble person k n o w that he is 
-humble? T h e humble person is a person no more. T h e humble person is 
in a state of fana: T h e humble person has dissolved. N o w he is only a 
presence. Humbleness is a presence, not a characteristic of personality, not 
a trait, but just a presence. Others will feel it, but you will not be able to 
feel it yourself. So is the case with simplicity. 
Simplicity simply means living m o m e n t to m o m e n t spontaneously, 
not according to some philosophy, not according to Jainism, Buddhism, 
Hinduism, not according to any philosophy. W h e n e v e r you live accord-
ing to a philosophy you have betrayed yourself, you are an enemy to 
yourself. Simplicity means to be in a deep friendship with oneself, to live 
your life with no idea interfering. 
It needs guts, certainly, because you will be living constantly in inse-
curity. T h e m a n w h o lives with ideals is secure. He is predictable; that is 
his security. He knows what he is going to do tomorrow. He knows, if a 
certain situation arises, this is the way he will react to it. He is always cer-
tain. T h e m a n w h o is simple knows nothing about tomorrow, knows 
nothing about the next m o m e n t , because he is not going to act out of his 
past. He will respond out of his present awareness. 
T h e simple person has no "character," only the complex person has 
character. Good or bad, that is not the point. There are good characters 
and bad characters, but b o t h are complex. T h e simple person is charac-
terless, he is neither good nor bad, but he has a beauty w h i c h no good 
people, no bad people can ever have. A n d the good and the bad are not 
very different; they are aspects of the same coin. T h e good person is bad 
behind it and the bad person is good behind it. 
133

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
134 
You will be surprised to k n o w that saints always dream that they are 
committing sins. If you look into the dreams of your so-called saints you 
will be very m u c h surprised. W h a t kinds of dreams do they go on see-
ing? That is their suppressed m i n d that bubbles up, surfaces into their 
dreams. Sinners always dream that they have b e c o m e saints. Sinners have 
the most beautiful dreams, because they have been committing sins their 
whole life. T h e y are tired of all those things. N o w the denied part starts 
speaking to t h e m in their dreams. 
In dreams the denied part speaks to you, your unconscious speaks to 
you: T h e unconscious is the denied part. R e m e m b e r , if you are good in 
your conscious, if you have cultivated good characteristics in your con-
scious, you will be bad: All that you have denied will become your un-
conscious, and vice versa. 
T h e simple person has no conscious, no unconscious; he has no divi-
sion. He is simply aware. His w h o l e house is full of light. His whole be-
ing knows only one thing: awareness. He has not denied anything, hence 
he has not created the unconscious. This is something to be understood. 
Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav J u n g and Alfred Adler and others 
think that the conscious and unconscious are something natural. They are 
not. T h e unconscious is a by-product of civilization. T h e more a person 
is civilized, the bigger an unconscious he has, because civilization means 
repression. Repression means you are denying a few parts of your being 
from coming into light, you are pushing t h e m into darkness, you are 
throwing them into your basement so that you never come across them. 
People have thrown their sex, their anger, their violence, into the 
basement and they have locked the doors. But violence, sex, and anger 
and things like that cannot be locked up. T h e y are like ghosts. They can 
pass through the walls, there is no way to prevent them. If you succeed in 
preventing them in your daytime, they will come in the night—they will 
haunt you in your dreams. 
It is because of the unconscious that people dream. T h e m o r e civi-
lized a person, the more he dreams. Go to the aboriginals, the natural 
people—a few are still in existence—and you will be again surprised to

135 
k n o w that they don't dream m u c h , very rarely, once in a while. Years pass 
and they never report any dreaming. They simply sleep, without dreams, 
because they have not repressed anything. T h e y have been living natu-
rally. 
T h e simple person will not have the unconscious, the simple person 
will not have dreams, but the complex person will have dreams. 
That's what happens to you. If you have a fast one day, in the night 
you will have a feast in your dreams. T h e fast creates the feast in the 
dream. A n d the people w h o are feasting in the day may start thinking of 
fasting; they always think about it. It is only rich countries w h i c h become 
interested in fasting. America is interested in fasting, dieting, and all 
things like that. A poor country cannot think of fasting. A poor country 
is always fasting, always dieting, always undernourished. O n l y rich people 
think of fasting. In India, Jainas are the 
richest community; their religion consists 
of fasting. M o h a m m e d a n s are the poorest, 
their religion consists of feasting. W h e n 
a poor m a n celebrates a religious day he 
gives a feast. W h e n a rich m a n celebrates 
his religious day he fasts. 
You can see the logic in it. We go on 
compensating. T h e dream is compensa-
tory, it compensates your waking life. T h e 
simple m a n will not dream, the simple 
man will not have any unconscious. 
T h e simple m a n will be simple. He 
will live m o m e n t to m o m e n t with no idea 
how to live; he will not have any philoso-
phy of life. He will trust in his intelligence. 
What is the need of having a philosophy? 
Why should one have a philosophy? So 
that it can guide you. It means if you are stupid you need a philosophy of 
life so that it can guide you. If you are intelligent you don't need any

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
136 
philosophy of life. Intelligence is enough unto itself, a light unto itself. 
A blind m a n asks for guidance: " W h e r e is the door? In what direc-
tion should I move? W h e r e is the turn?" Only the blind m a n prepares 
himself before he takes any move. T h e m a n w h o has eyes simply moves 
because he can see. W h e n the door comes he will k n o w and w h e n the 
turn comes he will know. He can trust in his eyes. 
And that is the case with the inner world, too. Trust in your intelli-
gence, don't trust in philosophies of life; otherwise you will remain stu-
pid. T h e major part of humanity has remained unintelligent because it 
has trusted in philosophies of life—Christian, H i n d u , M o h a m m e d a n . 
Again, something of very great importance to be remembered: Each 
child is b o r n intelligent. Intelligence is not something that a few have 
and a few don't have. Intelligence is the fragrance of life itself. Life has 
it—if you are alive you are intelligent. But then if you never trust in it, it 
starts slowly, slowly disappearing from your life. If you don't use your legs 
you will lose the capacity to run. If you don't use your eyes for three 
years and you remain with a blindfold you will b e c o m e blind. You can 
keep your senses alive only if you go on continuously using them. 
Intelligence is a natural p h e n o m e n o n ; every child is b o r n intelligent. 
Very few people live intelligently, and very few people die intelligently. 
Ninety-nine point nine percent of people remain stupid their whole 
life—and they were not unintelligent in the beginning. So what hap-
pens? They never use their intelligence. W h e n they are small children 
they trust their parents and their guidance. 
In a better world the parents, if they really love their children, will 
teach t h e m to trust their o w n intelligence. In a better world the parents 
will help the children to be independent as soon as possible, to be on their 
own. 
Then, they have to trust the teachers in the school; then the profes-
sors in the college and in the university. By the time one-third of their 
hfe is gone, they c o m e out of the university utterly stupid. One-third of 
their life they have been taught to trust somebody else: that's h o w their 
intelligence has been prevented from functioning.

Look at small children, h o w intelligent they are, h o w alive, h o w 
fresh, h o w tremendously ready to learn. A n d look at older people, dull, 
insipid, not ready to learn a thing, clinging to all that they know, clinging 
to the known, never ready to go on any adventure. 
In a better world children will be thrown u p o n themselves as soon as 
possible; the whole effort of the parents should be to make the child use 
his intelligence. A n d the w h o l e effort, if education is right—if it is educa-
tion and not miseducation—will be to throw the child again and again 
back to his own intelligence so that he can function, so that he can use it. 
He may not be so efficient in the beginning, that is true—the teacher may 
have the right answer, and if the student has to w o r k out his o w n answer 
the answer may not be so right—but that is not the point at all. T h e an-
swer may not be so right, it may not correspond to the answers given in 
the books, but it will be intelligent. A n d that is the real crux of the matter. 
Watch children and you will be constantly surprised. But we start 
destroying their intelligence because we are too concerned about the 
right answer—not the intelligent answer, but the right answer. That is a 
wrong concern. Let the answer be intelligent, let the answer be a little bit 
original, let the answer be the child's own. D o n ' t be bothered about the 
. right, don't be in such a hurry; the right will come on its own. Let the 
child search for it, let h i m stumble u p o n it on his own. W h y are we in 
such a hurry? 
We simply drop the child's growth of intelligence; we supply the 
right answer. Just think: T h e w h o l e process is that the child is never al-
lowed to find the answer himself. We give h i m the answer. W h e n the 
answer is given from the outside, intelligence need not grow, because in-
telligence only grows w h e n it has to find the answer itself. 
But we are so obsessed with the idea of the right. No w r o n g should 
ever be committed. W h y not? A n d the person w h o never commits any 
Wrong never grows. Growth needs that you should go astray sometimes, 
that you should start playing around, fooling around, that you should find 
original things, even though they may be wrong. You should come to the 
right by your own efforts, by your o w n growth; then there is intelligence.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
To be simple means to be intelligent. Simplicity is intelligence, living 
without ideals, without guides, without maps, just living m o m e n t to m o -
ment without any security. 
O u r concern with the right and our 
fear of the w r o n g is nothing but our fear 
of the insecure. T h e right makes us secure, 
the w r o n g makes us insecure, but life is in-
security. There is no security anywhere. 
You may have a bank balance, but the bank 
can go bankrupt any day. You may have 
the security of having a husband or a wife, 
but the wife can leave you any moment, 
she can fall in love; or the husband may 
die. 
Life is insecure. Security is only an il-
lusion that we create around ourselves, a 
cozy illusion. A n d because of this cozy il-
lusion we kill our intelligence. T h e man 
w h o wants to live simply will have to live 
in insecurity, will have to accept the fact 
that nothing is secure and certain, that we 
are on an u n k n o w n journey, that nobody 
can be certain where we are going and no-
body can be certain from where we are 
coming. 
In fact, except for the stupid people 
nobody 
has 
illusions 
of 
certainty. the 
m o r e intelligent you are, the m o r e uncertain you are. T h e m o r e intelli-
gent you are, the m o r e hesitant—because life is vast. Life is immense, 
immeasurable, mysterious. H o w can you be certain? 
Living in uncertainty, living in insecurity, is simplicity. Living a life 
without ideals, without character, a life not rooted in the past, not moti 
vated by the future; a life utterly here and now.

A L I G H T U N T O YOURSELF 
139 
T h e last words of Gautama the Buddha on the earth were: Be a light unto 
yourself. Do not follow others, do not imitate, because imitation, follow-
ing, creates stupidity. You are b o r n with a tremendous possibility of intel-
ligence. You are b o r n with a light within you. Listen to the still, small 
voice within, and that will guide you. N o b o d y else can guide you, n o -
body else can become a model for your life, because you are unique. 
There has never been anyone w h o was exactly like you, and n o b o d y is 
ever again going to be exactly like you. This is your glory, your 
grandeur—that you are utterly irreplaceable, that you are just yourself 
and n o b o d y else. 
T h e person w h o follows others becomes false, he becomes pseudo, 
he becomes mechanical. He can be a great 
saint in the eyes of others, but deep down, 
he is simply unintelligent and nothing else. 
He may have a very respectable character 
but that is only on the surface, it is not 
even skin-deep. Scratch h i m a little and 
you will be surprised that inside he is a t o -
tally different person, just the opposite of 
his outside. 
By following others you can cultivate 
a beautiful character, but you cannot have 
a beautiful consciousness, and unless you 
have a beautiful consciousness you can 
never be free. You can go on changing 
your prisons, you can go on changing your 
bondages, your slaveries. You can be a 
Hindu or a M o h a m m e d a n or a Christian 
or a Jaina—that is not going to help you. 
To be a Jaina means to follow Mahavira as the model. Now, there is n o -
Body w h o is like Mahavira or ever can be. Following Mahavira, you will

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
140 
b e c o m e a false entity. You will lose all reality, you will lose all sincerity, 
you will be untrue to yourself. You will become artificial, unnatural, and 
to be artificial, to be unnatural, is the way of the mediocre, the stupid, the 
fool. 
Buddha defines wisdom as living in the light of your o w n conscious-
ness, and he defines foolishness as following others, imitating others, be-
coming a shadow to somebody else. 
T h e real master creates masters, not followers. T h e real master 
throws you back to yourself. His whole effort is to make you indepen-
dent of him, because you have been dependent for centuries, and it has 
not led you anywhere. You still continue to stumble in the dark night of 
the soul. 
O n l y your inner light can b e c o m e the sunrise. T h e false master per-
suades you to follow him, to imitate him, 
to be just a carbon copy of him. T h e real 
master will not allow you to be a carbon 
copy, he wants you to be the original. He 
loves you! H o w can he make you imita-
tive? He has compassion for you, he would 
like you to be utterly free—free from all 
outer dependencies. 
But the ordinary h u m a n being does 
not want to be free. He wants to be de-
pendent. He wants somebody else to guide 
him. W h y ? Because then he can throw the 
whole responsibility on the shoulders of 
somebody else. A n d the m o r e responsibil-
ity you throw away onto somebody else's 
shoulders, the smaller the possibility of 
your ever b e c o m i n g intelligent. It is re-
sponsibility, the challenge of responsibility, that creates wisdom. 
O n e has to accept life with all its problems. O n e has to go through life 
unprotected; one has to seek and search one's way. Life is an opportunity'

a challenge, to find yourself. But the fool does not want to go the hard 
, way, the fool chooses the shortcut. He says to himself, "Buddha has 
attained—why should I bother? I will just watch his behavior and imitate 
it. Jesus has attained, so w h y should I search and seek? I can simply b e -
come a shadow to Jesus. I can simply go on following h i m wherever he 
goes." 
But by following somebody else, h o w are you going to b e c o m e in-
telligent? You will not provide any chance for your intelligence to ex-
plode. It needs a challenging life, an adventurous life, a life that knows 
h o w to risk and h o w to go into the u n k n o w n , for intelligence to arise. 
And only intelligence can save y o u — n o b o d y else. Your o w n intelligence, 
mind you, your o w n awareness, can become your nirvana. 
Be a light unto yourself and you will be wise; let others become your 
leaders, your guides, and you will remain stupid, and you will go on miss-
ing all the treasures of life—which were yours.

RESPONSES TO Q U E S T I O N S 
Can 
computers 
take 
over the work 
of human 
intelligence? 
T h e question may not appear very serious, but it is one of the most seri-
ous questions possible. T h e first thing to remember is that it is going to 
happen. There is no possibility to avoid it; neither is there any need to 
avoid it. Perhaps I am the only one in the world w h o is in absolute sup-
port of mechanical brains taking over the w o r k of h u m a n intelligence. 
T h e reasons are very clear, w h y I am in support of such a strange thing. 
First, what we call the h u m a n m i n d is itself a biocomputer. Just be-
cause you are b o r n with it does not make m u c h difference. A better com-
puter can be implanted in your mind—far m o r e efficient, far more 
intelligent, far m o r e comprehensive. 
There are always people w h o are afraid of every new thing. Every 
n e w thing has been opposed by religions, by churches vehemently, be-
cause every n e w thing changes the w h o l e structure of h u m a n life. for 
example, the computer can change all the stupidity that m a n has shown 
through the w h o l e of history. I don't think that computers will like to 
142

143 
create war, or computers will exploit people, or computers will discrimi-
nate between black and white, between m a n and w o m a n . 
Moreover, you are always the master, not the computer. You can al-
ways change the program of the computer. T h e computer is simply a 
tremendous instrument, which gives you immense possibilities that are 
not available to you biologically. You can do things w h i c h m a n has never 
dreamt of. T h e computer can be a thousand times more superior than Al-
bert Einstein. Naturally the computer can produce a science far m o r e 
fundamental, far m o r e real, not changing every day because n e w discov-
eries go on happening and the old discovery becomes out of date. T h e 
computer can reach the very center of reality. 
It can reveal to you whatever you want. It is an instrument in your 
hands. It is not a danger. 
A n d because it will be doing all the intellectual, mental work, n o -
body has seen the possibility that I am telling you, that you will be left 
very simply to relax into meditation. T h e computer can be put to the 
side. T h e computer can do all the thinking; you need not go on contin-
uously chattering unnecessarily. A n d the computer is not Christian, is not 
Hindu, is not M o h a m m e d a n . It is simply a mechanical device created by 
h u m a n consciousness. A n d in return it can help h u m a n consciousness to 
reach its highest potential. 
But every n e w thing will be opposed, because every n e w thing will 
make old things out of date. O l d factories will close, old industries will 
close. There are many inventions that are never marketed in the world 
because the people whose business will be affected by t h e m purchase 
their patents. A n d the scientist has not the m o n e y to make his o w n c o n -
ception into a reality. 
There are hundreds of inventions that can help humanity to be more 
comfortable, to be m o r e joyous, to have better clothes, better food. But 
they will not ever come to light because there are people w h o are going 
to be ruined if those n e w things come onto the market. A n d n e w things 
naturally create fear. 
But today, many factories are r u n by robots. T h e y never tire, they

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
never retire; they don't ask for a salary or for a raise; they don't form 
unions, they don't go on strike. They are the nicest people you can find. 
A n d they w o r k twenty-four hours, day in, 
day out. Their efficiency is perfect, a h u n -
dred percent. But it is a danger because 
people are becoming unemployed. N o w 
these unemployed people are going to cre-
ate trouble; they don't want robots. But I 
am 
all 
in 
favor 
of robots. 
Everybody 
should be unemployed and paid—paid for 
being unemployed. R o b o t s are doing the 
work, you get the pay. A n d life becomes 
sheer joy. 
T h e n you can meditate, you can dance, 
you can sing, you can go for world trips. 
T h e 
problem 
arises because 
we 
cannot 
think of the solution. T h e solution is sim-
ple. You were paid because you were pro-
ducing. N o w the robot is producing more, 
m u c h more efficiently, and he is not being 
paid. There is no need for you to remain 
unemployed, hungry, poor. It is such simple 
arithmetic: You should be paid—paid more 
because n o w you have vacated the place for a robot that produces a hun-
dred times more. So if your salary is doubled there is no loss. 
A n d if the whole world is unemployed and has enough m o n e y to en-
joy, do you think anybody is going to join the army? People will join car-
nivals, circuses. . . All kinds of celebrations will happen, but there is no 
need for war. A n d even if war is an absolute necessity, robots are there, just 
let t h e m fight. N o b o d y is going to win. B o t h sides are robots; nobody is 
going to be killed. Every day they come back with a few parts missing; repair them an
will be no question of defeat or victory. 
144

145 
But people are afraid because they cannot conceive of a world in 
which people don't suffer. Your concern is that these computers are going 
to take the place of intelligence. They will be far superior in intelligence, 
but remember one thing: Those computers are in your hands. You are not 
in their hands, so there is no problem. 
Up to n o w you have lived according to memory, which is an u n n e c -
essary burden, carrying it in your head. Twenty-five years of teaching in 
the schools, colleges, universities; Ph.D.s, D.Litt.s. . . W h a t are you d o -
ing? You are creating a computer, but with an old, out-of-date m e t h o d — 
forcing small children to memorize. There is no need. T h e computer can 
do everything, it just has to be given information. 
You can buy a computer that knows everything about medical sci-
ence. You need not go to a medical college; you simply ask the computer 
and immediately the answer is there. Your m e m o r y is not so reliable. A n d 
the computer can always be fed with n e w memory, because n e w discover-
ies are being made every day. T h e computer can be plugged into the main 
computer of the university, so without your even bothering, every n e w 
discovery concerning your subject is immediately fed into your computer. 
It waits there, you make an inquiry, and the computer tells you. 
You can have a multidimensional computer which has all kinds of 
memory, or a one-dimensional computer which has only history, the 
whole history of mankind. Now, you cannot have the whole history of 
mankind. Do you k n o w on what date Socrates was married to Xanthippe? 
The computer can tell you immediately. That unfortunate date . . . I have 
always suspected that Socrates accepted the poison so easily because of his 
wife, because life was so torturous—death cannot be worse than that. 
H o w m u c h can you memorize? Your m e m o r y has a limitation. But 
the computer can m e m o r i z e almost unlimited amounts of things. A n d 
there are many m o r e possibilities: O n e computer can j o i n together with 
another computer and manage to figure out n e w inventions, n e w m e d i -
cines, n e w ways of health, n e w ways of living. 
Computers should not be taken as monsters. T h e y are a great bless-
ing. And what man's intellect has done is very small. O n c e the computer

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
146 
takes over, so m u c h can be done that there will be no need for anybody 
to be hungry, no need for anybody to be poor, no need for anybody to be 
a thief, no need for anybody to be a judge, because these all belong to the 
same profession—judges and thieves, criminals and lawmakers. There is 
no need for anybody to be poor and no need for anybody to be rich. 
Everybody can be affluent. 
But perhaps no government will allow this to happen. No rehgion 
will allow this to happen, because it will go against their scriptures, it will 
go against their doctrines. Hindus believe that you have to suffer because 
in your past life you committed evil acts. N o b o d y knows about past lives. 
T h e y cannot accept an invention w h i c h can remove misery, poverty, sick-
ness, because then what will happen to the theory of reincarnation, and 
rewards and punishments of good and bad deeds? T h e w h o l e doctrine of 
H i n d u i s m will be simply meaningless. 
A y o u n g m a n came from the university with the degree of M . D . 
His old father was waiting for him, because he was tired, w o r k -
ing his w h o l e life. Three of his sons were studying at medical 
college—if at least one comes back, he can take his place and 
support the other two. A n d the y o u n g m a n immediately said, 
"You need n o t be worried. You rest and relax, I will take care." 
A n d the third day he approached his father and said, "Dad, 
the w o m a n you have been treating for thirty years I have cured." 
T h e father said, "You idiot! That is the w o m a n w h o has 
paid for your education and was paying for your two other 
brothers. I was keeping her in this condition. She was so rich she 
could afford to be sick. She was not poor." 
To be rich and to be sick is very dangerous. To be poor and to be 
sick is not very dangerous. You will be cured very soon, because you can-
not pay m u c h . On the contrary, you may ask the doctor, " W h a t about the 
medicine, what about the food you have prescribed? I don't have any 
money." T h e doctor will think, "It is better to cure h i m and get rid of

147 
him." But w h e n a rich m a n is sick, then it becomes professionally a very 
strange dilemma in the m i n d of the physician: to cure h i m or to have h i m 
linger on—because the more he lingers 
on, the more money you get. If you cure 
him, you don't get that money. 
But if computers can manage, then 
many professions will 
be 
affected. And 
these will be the professions that will pre-
vent it; they will make a thousand and one 
excuses: G o d never created a computer, 
computers are dangerous because they will 
take all intelligence away from you. 
What are you doing with your intelli-
gence? Being miserable, being jealous? At 
least computers will not be jealous and will 
not be miserable. W h a t are you doing with 
your intelligence? Destructiveness, all kinds 
of wars, all kinds of violence. 
Computers can give you a complete holiday for your w h o l e life. You 
can relax. You will have to learn h o w to relax, because you have all b e -
come workaholics. For thousands of years, work, work, w o r k hard! C o m -
puters will go against your w h o l e conditioning about work. Laziness will 
become for the first time a spiritual quality: Blessed are the laziest, for 
theirs is the k i n g d o m of this planet. A n d in their laziness, if they want, 
they can make beautiful gardens. It is just out of joy, for no purpose. 
They can paint—not to sell, but just to rejoice in the colors, the mixing 
of colors, the dance of colors. T h e y can play m u s i c — n o t for any m o n e -
tary reason, n o t as a business, but simply as a playful joy. 
W h a t m a n has dreamt of finding in paradise, life can really b e c o m e 
here on this planet. T h e r e is no need to go that far. A n d n o b o d y knows 
the way and n o b o d y has ever g o n e there. A n d those w h o have g o n e 
have not even dropped a card: " W e have arrived!" Such miserly p e o -
ple—just a Christmas card . . . But paradise has to be created; there is

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
148 
no paradise in existence. It has to c o m e out of man's awareness, c o n -
sciousness. 
T h e computer is also part of man's creativity. T h e r e is no need to b e -
come a competitor; you are the master. A n d for the first time the c o m -
puter and you are separate. That's what all the teachings of the mystics 
have been telling you, that your m i n d and you are separate. But it is diffi-
cult because the m i n d is inside your head and your consciousness is so 
close to it, so thousands of mystics have been teaching this but nobody 
listens. T h e distance is not very great. But with computers, the distance 
will be very clear; there will be no need for any mystic to tell you. 
Everybody has his o w n computer in his pocket and knows that it is 
separate. A n d one is free from thinking—the computer is doing it. You 
want to think something, tell the computer to think it. If your old habit 
of chattering arises, tell the computer, "Chatter," and it will chatter. But 
you can be for the first time what the buddhas have been talking about— 
just aware, silent, peaceful, a pool of consciousness. 
A computer cannot be aware. A computer can be intellectual, a com-
puter can be knowledgeable; a computer can be so knowledgeable that it 
can contain all the information of all the libraries in the w h o l e world— 
a single computer that you can keep in your pocket. It will relieve mil-
lions of people from memorizing unnecessary things. 
It will keep 
millions of people from teaching and torturing students. Examinations 
and all kinds of stupid things will disappear. 
T h e computer can be one of the greatest p h e n o m e n a that has ever 
happened. It can become the q u a n t u m leap. It can break away from the 
past and all conditionings of the past. 
H y m i e Goldberg answers a classified advertisement in a 
newspaper which says, "Opportunity of a lifetime!" He is given 
an address and finds himself face to face with old man Finkelstein. 
" W h a t I am looking for," explains old m a n Fink, "is some-
body to do all my w o r r y i n g for me. Your j o b will be to shoulder 
all my cares."

"That's quite a job," says H y m i e . " H o w m u c h do I get 
paid?" 
"You will get twenty thousand dollars a year," says old m a n 
Fink, "to make every w o r r y of m i n e your own." 
"Okay," says Hymie, " w h e n do I get paid?" 
"Aha!" says Fink. "That's your first worry." 
Why 
does 
humanity 
seem 
so 
willing 
to 
walk 
the path 
toward global 
suicide? 
T h e reason is clear. People have realized that their life has no meaning, 
that except for misery, nothing happens; except for anxiety, anguish, life 
has nothing to offer. 
Individuals have always committed suicide. A n d you will be sur-
prised: T h e people w h o have committed suicide have always been a litde 
more intelligent than the normal people. Psychologists c o m m i t suicide 
twice as m u c h as any other profession. Painters, poets, philosophers either 
go mad or commit suicide. Idiots have never been k n o w n to c o m m i t sui-
ileide, nor do they go mad. 
T h e idiots have never committed suicide because they cannot even 
think about meaning, significance, purpose. T h e y don't think at all; they 
simply live, they vegetate. T h e higher the intelligence, the m o r e danger-
ous, because it makes you aware that the life that you are living is just hol-
low, utterly empty. T h e r e is nothing to hold on to. You k n o w t o m o r r o w 
will be a repetition of today, so what is the point of continuing? 
Individuals have committed suicide because only individuals have 
come to a certain stage of intelligence, of understanding whether life has 
any meaning or not. Now, for the first time, millions of people around 
the earth have reached that maturity where they feel life is meaningless. 
That's w h y humanity is moving toward a global suicide. T h e r e seems to 
he no reason to continue—for what? You have lived your life, and you 
have found nothing. N o w your children will live and they will find 
149

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
150 
nothing: generation after generation, only emptiness in your hands—no 
fulfillment, no contentment. 
But to me, this gives man a tremen-
dous opportunity. O n l y very highly intel-
ligent people have committed suicide or 
have b e c o m e mad, because they could not 
live with this insane world. They could not 
adapt themselves to all kinds of insanities 
that are going around. T h e y felt themselves 
fallen apart—that was their madness. But 
only the same kind of people have also be-
come enlightened. 
So these are the three possibilities for 
intelligence. Either the intelligent person 
goes mad because he cannot figure out 
what is happening, w h y it is happening, 
w h y he is supposed to do this or that. Or, 
seeing the situation, that it is driving him 
mad, he commits suicide, he puts an end to 
life. This has been mostly the case in the 
West. 
In the East the same kind of people 
have tried something else—not madness, but meditation. T h e West is poor 
in that way. It does not k n o w the richness of meditation. It does not know 
that meditation can transform your whole vision of life; it can give you 
tremendous meaningfulness, beauty, benediction. T h e n life is something sa-
cred, you cannot destroy it. 
You must look at it, that in the East the rate of suicide is very low 
compared to the West, the rate of people going m a d is very low com-
pared to the West. A n d one thing more: In the East, the people who go 
mad are really not very intelligent people. T h e y are psychologically sick' 
It is n o t their intelligence that has led t h e m to madness, it is something 
missing in their minds. Perhaps their food is not right, it is not enough to

help their m i n d become mature. Their vegetarianism is lacking certain 
proteins which are absolutely needed for intelligence to grow. 
So the madness in the West and in the East is totally different. T h e 
madness in the East is something psychological: They are missing certain 
things, their growth is retarded, their minds cannot grow the way they 
would have grown. 
T h e people w h o c o m m i t suicide in the East are also different from 
the people w h o commit suicide in the West. In the East people c o m m i t 
suicide because of hunger, because of starvation, because they cannot 
manage to live—and life becomes such a 
torture. So there is a qualitative difference. 
But the intelligent people in the East 
have 
always 
turned 
toward 
meditation. 
Whenever they have felt that life has no 
meaning, they have tried to find the m e a n -
ing within themselves; that's the way of 
meditation. They have tried to find out the 
very source of life, love, and they have 
found it. Anybody w h o looks inward is 
bound to find it. It is not far away, it is just 
within you. You are carrying it all the time! 
T h e Western intelligentsia is looking 
for meaning outside, and there is no m e a n -
ing outside. They are looking for blissful-
ness outside. R e m e m b e r , the beauty is in 
the eyes of the onlooker; it is not there 
outside. A n d the same is true about mean 
ingfulness, blissfulness, benediction. It is 
Within your vision, it is within you. W h e n 
you have it, you can project it over the 
hole of existence. But first you have to find it within yourself. 
If Jean-Paul 
Sartre, Marcel 
Proust, Martin 
Heidegger, Ludwig 
Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, people like these, had been b o r n in the 
151

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
152 
East, they would all have become enlightened beings. But in the West, 
they all became tremendously burdened with anguish, anxiety. They 
found that it is all accidental and meaningless, that there is no purpose in 
life, and joy is just a dream, just a hope; it does not exist in reality. 
T h e West needs meditation. T h e East needs medicine; it is sick in the 
body. T h e West is sick in the soul. O n c e we understand the problem 
clearly . . . N o w it is not the East w h i c h is a danger to the world; at the 
most they can starve and die as they are dying in Ethiopia. But it is not a 
danger to the world. In fact, in a way the starving East is helping the 
world by dying. It is reducing the population of the world. It is making 
everybody richer, without your k n o w i n g it. O n e thousand Ethiopians 
dying every day—you may not see that s o m e h o w they are helping your 
comfort, but they are, because if the population of the world is reduced, 
people can live m o r e comfortably, m o r e easily, m o r e joyously. 
T h e problem is not coming from the East; the problem is coming 
from the West. T h e problem is that the Western intelligentsia is fed up 
with life, so there is no real resistance from the intelligentsia against nu-
clear weapons, against a third world war. In fact, it seems deep down the 
Western m i n d is somehow hoping that it happens soon, because life is 
meaningless. 
R a t h e r than taking the risk of committing suicide yourself, if politi-
cians can manage to destroy the w h o l e world, that will be far easier. You 
will not be in the dilemma of to be or not to be. You will not have to 
think whether to destroy yourself or not, to w o n d e r if perhaps tomorrow 
things may be different. 
It is an individual responsibility to commit suicide, but a global war, 
a nuclear war—all your personal responsibility disappears. It is not your 
doing, it is just happening. 
W h y is the Western intelligentsia not really fighting against nuclear 
weapons? W h y are the scientists—who are part of the intelligentsia still 
serving governments? T h e simplest way would be for all the scientists 
w h o are creating nuclear weapons to resign. T h e y should say, "Enough is 
enough. We cannot create these weapons w h i c h are going to destroy life

on the earth." A n d the poets, the philosophers, the painters—they don't 
seem to protest. They have just b e c o m e spectators. There is a reason b e -
hind it. Western humanity has been turned by and by into spectators— 
about everything. 
You don't play football, but twenty-two persons w h o are profession-
als, this is their business, to play football. A n d millions of people are just 
spectators, and they are so excited . . . j u m p i n g in their seats, screaming, 
shouting. If they are not in the stadium, then they are sitting in their 
homes before the television screen and they are doing the same gestures 
there. Somebody else is playing; you are just a spectator. 
T h e average American is looking at the television five to six hours a 
day: six hours of just being a spectator, not a participant. T h e n there are 
movies where you are spectators, and there are boxing matches where 
you are spectators. It seems you have lost contact with life. You simply 
see others living; your life is just to watch. Somebody is in a competition 
for a world championship in chess, and you are watching. Can't you play 
chess yourself? Can't you play football yourself? 
It is not far away, it is already happening . . . you will n o t be making 
love to your wife, to your girlfriend—somebody else will be doing it and 
you will be watching, j u m p i n g : "Aha! Great! Go on!" 
You have left the w h o l e of life for others to live on your behalf, and 
then you ask where the m e a n i n g has gone, w h y you don't feel alive, 
why there is n o t some significance in your life. Spectators cannot have 
significance—only participants, totally involved, intensely involved in 
every action. 
So perhaps the Western intelligentsia is just in the situation of spec-
tators, watching w h e n it is announced on the television that the third 
World war has begun. Listening to the radio, reading the newspaper . . . 
But are you going to do something or not? 
It is doing that keeps your juices running. If you are simply watching, 
your own juices dry up. You b e c o m e just a skeleton. 
I am surprised that the West has a great, educated, intelligent majority in the world, but th
153

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
spreading—you are simply watching. Your governments are piling up 
nuclear weapons, preparing your funeral pyre—and you are just watching. 
You have to be taken out of this hypnotic state of being a mere spec-
tator. There are not many people w h o are making nuclear weapons. 
There are only a few scientists w h o k n o w how. Can't they simply say, 
" N o , we are not going to be servants of death"? 
And all the poets and all the painters 
and 
all 
the 
great 
N o b e l 
prizewinners, 
novelists, actors, musicians, dancers—what 
are they doing? There should be a great 
protest—all the nuclear weapons should be 
drowned in the Pacific. W h o e v e r named it 
the "Pacific" must have had a great insight 
into the future. N o w let that name be-
come a reality. 
But the trouble is, unless you start feel-
ing some meaning in life, some joy arising 
in you, some fragrance surrounding you, 
you cannot fight for life. A n d life needs, for 
the first time in the history of man, to be 
fought for. 
Meditation will create the necessary 
atmosphere. It will bring you back to ac-
tion, back to love, back to meaning. And 
then, naturally, you will see that it is time 
for something to be done. This beautiful earth should not die. 
This is a unique planet, very small. In this immense universe, which 
knows no limits, this small earth is u n i q u e — u n i q u e because birds sing 
here, flowers blossom here, life has reached a n e w level: consciousness. 
A n d in a few people consciousness has touched its omega point: enlight-
enment. 
C o m p a r e d to this earth, the w h o l e universe is dead. It is big, vast, 
but even a single rose flower is far m o r e valuable than the biggest stars-
154

Anybody w h o wants to destroy this earth wants to destroy something 
unique that is evolving. A n d it has taken millennia to come to this state 
of consciousness. Even if only a few people have attained to ultimate 
bliss and ecstasy, that is enough to make this earth the greatest treasure. 
There are millions of solar systems, but no solar system can claim a 
Gautam Buddha, a Lao Tzu, a Bodhidharma, a Kabir. This earth has done 
something immensely great, it has made the w h o l e universe rich. It can-
not be destroyed. 
War should be stopped—and it is within our hands to do so. D o n ' t 
be only a spectator. R a t h e r than just remaining in your misery, start find-
ing sources of life and mystery within yourself. That is the only possibil-
ity for saving the whole world. 
I cannot cope with many social situations I 
find 
myself in. Do I need the 
help 
of 
a psychiatrist? 
Your m i n d is perfectly okay. In fact, this situation happens to everybody 
w h o has a certain intelligence. It is not that you are lacking something, it 
is that you have m o r e than average intelligence. This problem is not b e -
cause of lack, this problem is because of something plus: You have m o r e 
intelligence than average. 
W h e n the m i n d is a little m o r e intelligent it is never satisfied because 
it can always imagine better situations; that is the problem. If you have 
one thousand rupees and you are stupid you can he satisfied! But h o w can 
an intelligent m a n be satisfied? He thinks of two thousand, three t h o u -
sand, five thousand; whatsoever he has he can always imagine more. 
You have a beautiful w o m a n ; a intelligent person starts thinking of 
more beautiful w o m e n , he goes on fantasizing. An idiot is satisfied b e -
cause he cannot imagine . . . he cannot even imagine a better situation, 
so w h y be unsatisfied, h o w to be unsatisfied? 
So psychiatrists cannot help because you don't have anything wrong! 
They cannot put anything right because there is nothing wrong. You 
155

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
156 
have m o r e than average intelligence. Now, you will have to apply this in-
telligence to your problems more deeply. R a t h e r than asking somebody 
else's help, you will have to apply your o w n intelligence to your prob-
lems. 
For example, w h e n you are unsatisfied with a certain thing, become 
very aware of w h y you are unsatisfied—see the whole dissatisfaction, go 
into it deeply. Layer by layer, open all the doors, examine every situation, 
every mood. Awareness is going to help you because you have intelli-
gence and intelligence can be converted into awareness. 
Sermons w o n ' t help—somebody saying, "Just be satisfied," is not go-
ing to help you; that you cannot do. You will have to go into deep analy-
sis of your o w n moods. So whenever you are feeling unsatisfied, nothing 
is w r o n g — t h e first thing to be understood is that nothing is wrong! You 
should feel fortunate because you could have been stupid—stupid people 
never have this problem, idiots don't have any problems. A problem is a 
good indication. 
A n d w h e n you think about life, w h e n you become aware of life . . . 
life is meaningless, so h o w to be satisfied with it? If you go deeply into 
this, by and by you will start feehng that in life there is no possibility of 
any satisfaction. T h e n you have stumbled u p o n the first basic truth—that 
life is meaningless. T h e n one can turn within; then there is no need to go 
outside, because outside there is no meaning possible. There is only anx-
iety and anguish. 
A n d people like you commit suicide. W h e n life becomes too heavy 
and everything is unsatisfactory and nothing brings happiness, one starts 
feeling, " W h a t is the point of going on living? T h e n destroy yourself!" 
People of your type either commit suicide or they become great seekers; 
both are possibilities. If they don't destroy themselves they start turning 
inward and they create a n e w life. T h e life that is available through the 
senses is meaningless, but that is not the only life. There is one more life, 
far greater, far m o r e glorious, and that is the life of an inward conscious-
ness. 
So n o w you are becoming a seeker, you are at the door of it, so please

don't think that you are ill. If you think in those terms you will start feel-
ing ill, you will hypnotize yourself into believing that you are ill. You are 
not ill at all. Completely drop that idea! Never go to a psychiatrist, b e -
cause if you go they will find something w r o n g with you even if it is not 
there. T h e y have to find it—they also have to live, so w h e n somebody 
comes they have to find something w r o n g and treat him. 
I can see deeply into you that there is nothing wrong. It is just that 
you are unfortunate in one way that you have more than average intelli-
gence. So you can make a misery out of it or you can make a blessing out 
of it—it depends on you. 
I feel fed up with myself, feel no connection between my inner world and 
the outer one. I used to have many interests 
but no longer feel in touch 
with 
them. 
This is how any intelligent person will feel. Boredom is the price one 
pays for intelligence. It should not be taken negatively. This is good, b e -
cause in understanding this there is a possibility to transcend. If you are 
not fed up, you can never transcend yourself. Blessed are those w h o are 
really fed up because they can transcend. Of course, to transcend is a dif-
ficult and arduous j o b ; it is n o t easy. It is like climbing Everest—it is a 
difficult thing—but once you are really fed up, then even in the difficulty 
there is a challenge. 
So the first thing is, don't be worried about it—it is good that it is so. 
And don't take it negatively—it is part of intelligence, and you are an in-
telligent person, so naturally you are b o u n d to come to this state of b o r e -
dom. 
T h e second thing . . . 
W h e n you start being fed up, naturally you will start w o n d e r i n g h o w 
to go inward because you are fed up with the outside, you k n o w all that 
is outside. I was just reading today a very ancient story of a king—his 
name was Bhartirhari. 
157

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
158 
W h e n he became the king, he called all his ministers and told them, 
"This will be my rule and this is my order to you: I want to experience 
everything once but never twice. So the same food has not to be served 
to me again, the same w o m a n has not to be brought to me again—• 
everything just once!" 
By the end of the year they came and said, " N o more is possible. All 
that we could do, we have done. N o w we are driving ourselves crazy— 
we cannot find n e w things!" 
T h e king said, "It is okay—I will renounce it all!" A n d he became a 
sannyasin. He said, " N o w finished! I have tasted everything once, what is 
the point of tasting it twice? I am not so stupid! O n c e is o k a y — n o w I 
k n o w the taste of it—but what is the point of repeating the taste of it?" 
I loved the story . . . it is tremendously beautiful. 
This is h o w any intelligent person will be! So there is nothing to be wor-
ried a b o u t — d o n ' t become serious about it. It is good, it is perfectly okay 
to feel fed up. People w h o don't feel fed up with themselves are in a 
w r o n g situation; they are in danger, they 
will never change. There is no need for 
t h e m to change. T h e y will go on revolving 
in the wheel—they are mechanical people. 
This is the first ray of consciousness in 
you—that you feel fed up. 
W h o is this one w h o feels fed up? 
This awareness is you—this is the first ray 
of consciousness. So the way that you have 
lived up to n o w and all the things that you 
have done up to n o w are meaningless. 
Now, the second thing . . . T h e prob-
lem arises that n o w the outside is almost 
finished—how to go inward? If you start struggling to go in, it will not 
be in. If you try and make an effort to go in, it will not be in, because

whatsoever we do with effort leads outside, takes us outside; anything 
done by effort moves outward. 
To go in means to relax, to let go—there is no other way. W h e n you 
relax you go in, w h e n you start doing something you go out. D o i n g 
means going out, n o n d o i n g means going in. That's w h y it is arduous. If 
there were something to do I would have told you, " D o this and you will 
be in." It is not a question of doing. You will have to learn patience, you 
will have to learn infinite patience. 
A n d just start sitting. W h e n e v e r you have time just sit silently with 
closed eyes not doing anything. You are fed up with the outside? By and 
by the dreams of the outside will disappear because there is no need for 
the dreams to continue. 
You will not think of food—if you think of food, then k n o w well you 
are not fed up. If you think of women, k n o w well you are not yet fed up. 
Your dreams will show you whether you are really fed up or if there is still 
some lingering interest. If a lingering interest is there, then finish that, too; 
there is no h a r m in it. If you are really fed up, by and by you will start feel-
ing that the energy is moving inward on its o w n accord. You are not doing 
anything, you are simply sitting there and it is going in, it is falling in. 
A n d through that inwardness your centering will arise. T h r o u g h that 
inwardness n e w interests, n e w enthusiasm, n e w style, a n e w way to live 
will come. You cannot cultivate it—all that you can cultivate will be just 
a repetition of the old . . . maybe a little modified here and there, but it 
won't make m u c h difference. So start sitting passively and do m o r e pas-
sive meditations. 
In my work I am always afraid of losing confidence in myself. 
In fact, we don't need as m u c h confidence as we think we need. 
Confidence can either be a great quality or it can be a hindrance to 
some. For example, foolish people are always m o r e confident than intel-
ligent people. Stupidity has a certain confidence to it. Foolish people are 
159

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
m o r e stubborn, and because they are blind, because they can't see, they 
rush anywhere—even where angels fear to tread. 
A person w h o is intelligent is b o u n d 
to have a little hesitancy. Intelligence is 
hesitant. That simply shows that there are 
millions of opportunities, millions of al-
ternatives, and one has to choose. Every 
choice is arbitrary, so a certain lack of con-
fidence is b o u n d to be there. T h e m o r e in-
telligent you are, the m o r e you will feel it. 
So n o t all confidence is good. Ninety-
nine percent of confidence is foolish. Only 
one percent is good, and that one percent is 
never absolute. That one percent is always 
hesitant because there are really so many 
alternatives. You are always standing at the 
crossroads, not k n o w i n g which road will 
really be the right one. H o w can you be 
confident? W h y do you expect to be con-
fident? 
All roads look almost the same but one 
has to choose. It is a gambler's choice. But 
that's h o w life is—and it is good that it is 
that way. If everything was clear-cut, preplanned, prefabricated, and you 
were just given instructions—"Move right and left and do this and 
that"—there would be confidence but of what use would it be? The 
thrill would be lost. There would be no light in life then. It would be a 
dead routine. 
Life is always thrilling because each step brings you to another cross-
roads . . . again so many roads, again you have to choose. You start trem-
bling. Will the choice be right or not? H o w to be rightly confident then? 
To be rightly confident is to think about all the alternatives and whatso-
ever you feel is a little better than the others . . . 
160

161 
D o n ' t ask for absolute good and absolute wrong. In life there is 
nothing like that. It is only a percentage; one is only a little better than 
the other, that's all. Life is not divided like 
t w o polarities into good and bad. There 
are a thousand and one situations between 
good and bad. So just look around objec-
tively, silently, feelingly, see every possibil-
ity, unworried, and whatsoever feels a little 
bit better than others, move on it. O n c e 
you decide to move, forget about other al-
ternatives, because they don't matter now. 
T h e n move confidently. 
This is really intelligent confidence. It 
does not destroy hesitation completely. It 
uses hesitation. It does not destroy alterna-
tives. Alternatives are there. It consciously 
broods and contemplates over all the alter-
natives as silently as humanly possible. 
Intelligence never demands anything in-
These are the paths. M a n y are moving 
to the right; they think it is better. You still 
feel that to move to the left is better, so of 
course there is going to be hesitation b e -
cause you k n o w that m a n y intelligent p e o -
ple are moving in the opposite direction. 
H o w can you be confident? You are not alone here. M a n y intelligent 
people are going that way and still you feel that this is right for you. 
Stand on the crossroads, think, meditate, but once you decide then 
forget all other alternatives—move. O n c e you decide to move, your 
whole energy is needed there. D o n ' t be split and don't let half of your 
mind think about alternatives. This is h o w one has to use hesitation. 
A n d there is no certainty that you are b o u n d to be right. That I am

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
162 
not saying. T h e r e is no way to be certain. You may be wrong, but there is 
no way to k n o w it unless you follow the road to the very end, all the way. 
But my understanding is that one should think righdy. T h e very 
thinking gives you growth. You move on the road—right or w r o n g is ir-
relevant. T h e very movement gives you growth. To me it is n o t a ques-
tion of where you go. To me the most important thing is that you are not 
stuck, but going. 
Even if this road comes to a dead end and it leads nowhere and you 
have to come back, nothing to w o r r y about. It is good that you went. 
T h e very movement has given you m u c h experience. You have k n o w n a 
w r o n g road. You are acquainted with w r o n g n o w m o r e than before. 
N o w you k n o w what is false; it will help you to find out the truth.To k n o w the false as false i
only way that one comes by and by to k n o w what truth is. To k n o w truth 
as true, the path moves from the experi-
ence of k n o w i n g false as false. A n d one has 
to move on many w r o n g roads before one 
comes to the right one. 
So to me, even if you are going toward 
hell, I bless you because there is no other 
way to k n o w hell. A n d if you don't know 
hell you will never be able to k n o w what 
heaven is. Go into the dark because that is 
the way to k n o w light. Go into death be-
cause that is the way to k n o w life. 
T h e only thing that is important is not 
to be stuck somewhere. D o n ' t just stand 
on the crossroads, hesitating, not going 
anywhere. 
D o n ' t 
make 
hesitation 
your 
habit. 
Use it—it is a good device. T h i n k about all the alternatives. I'm not 
saying don't think, don't hesitate at all. D o n ' t move like a stupid m a n and 
r u n with closed eyes, blindfolded, so there is no problem and you don't

k n o w that other roads exist. That's w h y stupid people are m o r e confi-
dent, but they have done m u c h h a r m in the world. T h e world would be 
better if there were fewer confident people. 
Look at the Adolf Hitlers—they are very confident. T h e y think G o d 
has given t h e m great w o r k to change the w h o l e world. They are stupid 
people but very confident. Even Buddha is not as confident as Adolf 
Hitler, because Buddha is not stupid. He understands the complexity of 
life. It is not so simple as Hitler thinks, but he just rushes and people fol-
low him. 
W h y do so many people follow such stupid leaders? W h y do so 
many people go on following politicians? W h a t happens? Rarely it 
happens that a politician is intelligent—because if he is intelligent he 
will not be a politician. Intelligence never 
chooses such a stupid thing. But w h y do so 
many people follow them? 
T h e reason is that people are n o t very 
confident. They don't k n o w where to go, 
so they are just waiting for some messiah, 
somebody to tell them that this is the right 
path and to tell them with such certainty, 
with such obsessive certainty, that their 
fears are dissipated. So they say, "Yes, here 
is the leader. N o w we will follow him. 
Here 
comes 
the 
right 
m a n — s o 
confi-
d e n t ! " 
That confidence of the leader—which 
is 
because 
of stupidity—helps 
h i m 
to 
gather a great following, because people are 
lacking in courage, in confidence. They 
are stuck. They are afraid to move. They 
are almost paralyzed because of their hesi-
tations. They need somebody w h o can become a torch and w h o is so 
confident that their o w n fear and lack of confidence does not trouble 
163

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
164 
them. N o w they can move with this man. T h e y can say, "Yes, we are not 
confident, you are. Your confidence becomes a substitute for us." 
So confidence is not always a virtue. 
Intelligence is always a virtue. So insist on intelligence. Sometimes it 
will make you very hesitant, nervous. It has to be so . . . it is natural. Life 
is so complex and one is moving in the u n k n o w n continuously. H o w can 
one be confident? T h e very demand is absurd. 
So make intelligence your goal and then hesitation, nervousness, 
everything, can be used in a creative way. 
J can see that my mind is still childish. Wliat can I do? 
There are things which one has just to be aware of. T h e very awareness 
brings the transformation; it is not that after being aware you have to do 
something to make the change. 
Seeing your m i n d as childish, you can also see that you are not the 
mind—otherwise, w h o is seeing the m i n d as childish? There is something 
beyond the m i n d — t h e watcher on the hills. 
You are only looking at the mind. You have completely forgotten 
w h o is looking at it. Watch the mind, but don't forget the watcher— 
because your reality is centered in the watcher, not in the mind. A n d the 
watcher is always a fully grown-up, mature, centered consciousness. It 
needs no growth. 
A n d once you become aware that the m i n d is only an instrument in 
the hands of your witnessing soul, then there is no problem; the mind can 
be used in the right way. N o w the master is awake, and the servant can be 
ordered to do whatever is needed. 
Ordinarily the master is asleep. We have forgotten the watcher, and 
the servant has become the master. A n d the servant is a servant—it is cer-
tainly not very intelligent. 
You have to be reminded of a basic fact: Intelligence belongs to the 
watching consciousness; m e m o r y belongs to the mind.

165 
M e m o r y is one t h i n g — m e m o r y is not intelligence. But the whole 
of humanity has been deceived for centuries and told indirectly that the 
m e m o r y is intelligence. Your schools, your colleges, your universities 
are not trying to find your intelligence; they arc trying to find out w h o is 
capable of memorizing more. 
And n o w we k n o w perfectly well that m e m o r y is a mechanical 
thing. A computer can have memory, but a computer cannot have intel-
ligence. And a computer can have a better m e m o r y than you have. Man's 
| m e m o r y is not so reliable. It can forget, it can get mixed up, it can get 
blocked. Sometimes you say that "I remember it, it is just on the tip of 
my tongue." Strange, it is on the tip of your tongue, then why don't you 
speak? 
But you say it is n o t coming, "It is on 
the tip of my tongue . . . I k n o w that I 
know, and it is not very far—it is very 
close." But still some block, some very thin 
block—it may be just a curtain—is not al-
lowing it to surface. And the m o r e you try, 
the more tense you become, the smaller 
the possibility of remembering it. Finally, 
you forget all about it, you start doing 
something else—preparing a cup of tea or 
digging a hole in the garden—and sud-
denly it is there because you were relaxed, 
you had forgotten all about it, there was no 
!' tension. It surfaced. 
A tense mind becomes narrow. A re-
laxed mind becomes w i d e — m a n y more 
memories can pass through it. A tense 
mind becomes so narrow that only very 
few memories can pass through it. 
But for thousands of years a misunderstanding has continued, and it 
I continues still, as if m e m o r y is intelligence. It is not.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
166. 
In India—as in Arabia, China, Greece, R o m e , in all old countries— 
all the old languages depend on memory, not on intelligence. You can 
b e c o m e a great Sanskrit scholar without a bit of intelligence—no need 
for intelligence, just your m e m o r y has to be perfect. Just like a p a r r o t . . . 
the parrot does not understand what he is saying, but he can say it ab-
solutely correctly, with the right pronunciation. You can teach h i m what-
ever you want. All old languages depend on memory. 
A n d the whole educational system of the world depends on m e m -
ory. In the examinations, they don't ask the student something that will 
show his intelligence but something that will show his memory, how 
m u c h he remembers from textbooks. This is one of the reasons for 
your retarded mind. You have used the m e m o r y as if it were your 
intelligence—a tremendously grave misunderstanding. Because you know 
and remember and you can quote scriptures, you start thinking that you 
are grown-up, you are mature, that you are knowledgeable, you are wise. 
This is the problem, that you are feeling. 
I am not a m a n of memory. A n d my effort here is to provoke a chal-
lenge in you so that you start moving toward your intelligence. 
It is of no use h o w m u c h you remember. W h a t is significant is how 
m u c h you have experienced yourself. A n d for experiencing the inner 
world, you need great intelligence—memory is of no help. Yes, if you 
want to be a scholar, a professor, a pundit, you can memorize scriptures 
and you can have a great pride that you k n o w so much. A n d other peo-
ple will also think that you k n o w so m u c h , and deep d o w n your memory 
is nothing but ignorance. 
In front of me, you cannot hide your ignorance. In every possible 
way, I try to bring your ignorance in front of you because the sooner you 
get hold of your ignorance, the sooner you can get rid of it. A n d to know 
is such a beautiful experience that the borrowed knowledge, in compart' 
son, is just idiotic. 
I have heard about the archbishop of Japan. He wanted to convert a 
Z e n master to Christianity. N o t knowing, not understanding anything

the inner world, he w e n t to the master. He was received with great love 
and respect. 
He opened his Bible and started reading the S e r m o n on the M o u n t . 
He wanted to impress u p o n the Z e n master: We follow this man. W h a t 
do you think about these words, about this man? 
He had read only t w o sentences and the Z e n master said, " T h a t will 
do. You are following a good man, but he was following other good men. 
Neither you k n o w nor does he know. Just go home." 
T h e archbishop was very shocked. He said, "You should at least let 
me finish the w h o l e thing." 
T h e Z e n master said, " N o nonsense here. If you k n o w something, 
you say it. Close the book! Because we are not believers in books. You are 
carrying the very truth in your being, and you are searching in dead 
books? Go h o m e and look within. If you have found something inside, 
then come. If you think these lines that you have repeated to me are from 
Jesus Christ, you are wrong." 
Jesus Christ was simply repeating the O l d Testament. He was trying 
his whole life to convince people that "I am the last prophet of the Jews." 
He had never heard the w o r d Christian, he had never heard the w o r d 
Christ. He was b o r n a Jew, he lived a Jew, he died a Jew. A n d his w h o l e ef-
fort was to convince the Jews that "I am the awaited prophet, the savior 
that Moses has promised. I have come." 
T h e Jews could have forgiven h i m . . . Jews are n o t bad people. A n d 
Jews are not violent people, either. N o b o d y w h o is as intelligent as the 
Jews are can be violent. Forty percent of N o b e l prizes go to Jews; it is 
simply out of all proportion to their population. Almost half the N o b e l 
prizes go to Jews, and the other half to the rest of the world. Such intel-
ligent people would not have crucified Jesus if he had been saying some-
thing of his o w n experience. But he was saying things that were not his 
experience—all borrowed. Yet he was pretending they were his. Jews 
could not forgive that dishonesty. 
Otherwise, Jesus was n o t creating any trouble for anybody. He was

a little bit of a nuisance. Just like the Witnesses of Jehovah or the Hare 
Krishna people; they are a little bit of a nuisance. If they catch hold of 
you they will not listen to you at all and they will go on giving you all 
kinds of wisdom, advice—and you are not interested; you are going for 
some other work, you want to be left alone. But they are determined to 
save you. W h e t h e r you want to be saved or not does not matter—you 
have to be saved. 
It happened that I was sitting near the Ganges in Allahabad, and it 
was just as the sun was setting. A m a n started shouting from the water, 
"Save me! Save m e ! " I am not interested in saving anybody. So I looked 
all around . . . if somebody is interested in saving him, let h i m have the 
first chance. But there was nobody, so finally I had to j u m p . 
A n d with difficulty . . . he was a heavy man, fat. T h e fattest m e n in 
India you will find in Allahabad and Varanasi—the Brahmins, the Hindu 
priests, w h o do nothing except eat. S o m e h o w I pulled h i m out. And he 
became angry. " W h y did you pull me out?" 
I said, "This is something! You were asking for help, you were shout-
ing, 'Save m e ! ' " 
He said, "It was because I was becoming afraid of death. But in fact 
I was committing suicide." 
I said, "I am sorry, I had no idea that you were committing suicide." 
I pushed the m a n back! A n d he started shouting again, "Help!" 
I said, " N o w wait for somebody else to come. I will sit here and 
watch you commit suicide." 
He said, " W h a t kind of m a n are you? I am dying!" 
I said, "Die! That is your business!" 
But there are people w h o are bent u p o n saving you. 
T h e Z e n master said to the archbishop, "Jesus was repeating the old 
prophets. You are repeating Jesus. Repetition is not going to help any-
body. You need your own experience—that is the only deliverance, the 
only liberation." 
It is good that you are beginning to understand that your mind be-
haves like a child, immature. R e m e m b e r also w h o is watching the childish,

immature mind, and be with the watcher. Pull all your attachments away 
. from the mind—because the m i n d is only a mechanism—and the m i n d 
will start functioning perfectly well. O n c e your watcher is alert, your in-
telligence starts growing for the first time. 
Mind's work is memory, w h i c h the m i n d can do very well. But the 
m i n d has been burdened by the society with intelligence, w h i c h is not its 
work. It has crippled its memory. It has not made you m o r e intelligent, it 
has simply made your m e m o r y erroneous, fallible. 
Always remember: Your eyes are for seeing, don't try to listen with 
the eyes. Your ears are for listening, don't try to see with the ears. O t h e r -
wise, you will get into an insane state. W h i l e your eyes are perfectly all 
right, your ears are perfectly all right, you are trying to do something 
with a mechanism that is not meant to do it. 
If your watcher is clear, then the body takes care of its o w n functions, the m i n d takes care 
; own functions. N o b o d y interferes in each other's work. 
And life becomes a harmony, an orchestra. 
J sometimes feel 
muddle-headed, 
as 
if losing 
my 
memory. 
M e m o r y one day has to go completely. If it is disappearing, it is a good 
sign. To be clean of m e m o r y means to be clean of past, and to be clean 
of past is to be absolutely open and available to the future. M e m o r y is 
not of the future, m e m o r y is of the past; it is always a graveyard. A n d the 
future belongs to life, to intelligence, to silence, to meditativeness. It does 
not belong to memory. 
O n c e a m a n becomes enlightened he does not function out of m e m -
ory, he functions spontaneously. A n d even on the path toward enlighten-
ment, slowly spontaneity goes on replacing memory. M e m o r y is the way 
of the unintelligent man. O n e w h o cannot respond to reality immediately needs a m e m o r y s
situations—what he has done before. But then his response is no longer 
169

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
170 
a response, it becomes a reaction. A n d all reactions fall short of the situa-
tion that is ahead of you, because the situation is continuously changing 
and the answers in your m e m o r y don't change. T h e y are just dead c o m -
modities, they remain the same. 
That's why, as a person grows old, he finds himself getting out of 
touch with the new generation that is growing. T h e fault is not of the 
n e w generation, the fault is of the old m a n w h o has nothing but m e m -
ory, and m e m o r y belongs to the past and the past is no longer there. The 
n e w generation is m o r e responsive to the present—that creates the gap. 
T h e old generation always wants old answers, old scriptures, old saints; 
the older they are the more true this is. 
Every religion tries to prove that their scriptures are the oldest. It is 
strange that they want to prove that. A n d they glory in their ancientness. 
In fact, the m o r e ancient they are, the m o r e useless they are, because they 
have lost touch with reality completely. T h e m a n of consciousness and 
wisdom, alive, actually responds to the situation. Otherwise all answers 
fall short and life becomes m o r e and m o r e a mess. 
So there is no need to be worried about it, if you are losing your 
m e m o r y and you see that you don't feel any parallel upsurge of intelli-
gence. You will not feel it. Intelligence is so subtle that you will not hear 
the sound of its footsteps. But slowly, slowly, it will transform your whole 
being and then suddenly, w h e n the w o r k is complete, you will awake 
from a deep sleep and you will see yourself as a new being, reborn. 
If you start b e c o m i n g m o r e sharp, m o r e intelligent, from where will 
you get the energy? T h e energy that is involved and invested in m e m o -
ries has to be withdrawn, and there is no h a r m in it. In the ordinary 
marketplace, perhaps, not to have a good m e m o r y can be dangerous. But 
if you look at the geniuses of the world, you will be surprised that one 
of the most c o m m o n points a m o n g all those geniuses is their lapse of 
memory. 
Edison is going for a lecture tour to a few universities. He is saying 
good-bye to his wife and the maidservant is also standing there. He kisses 
the maidservant, thinking that she is his wife, and waves to his wife

thinking that she is the maidservant. T h e driver of the car w h o was tak-
ing h i m cannot believe what is happening. 
He said, "Sir, you have forgotten, you have got mixed up. T h e 
w o m a n w h o m you are waving to is your wife and the other w o m a n is 
He said, " M y God. There is no harm, I can get out of the car and put 
1 things right." He kissed his wife, waved to the maidservant, and he said, 
"It often happens that I forget very essential things." 
Once, George Bernard Shaw was traveling in a train. T h e ticket 
checker came and Bernard Shaw looked all over, he almost felt like he 
was having a nervous breakdown because the ticket could not be found. 
T h e ticket checker said, " D o n ' t be worried, sir. I k n o w you, the whole 
world knows you. T h e ticket must be somewhere in your luggage and I 
will be coming in the next round, you can show me t h e n — a n d even if 
you don't show me there is no need to worry." He was not ready to lis-
ten to what Bernard Shaw said to him: "You shut up. You don't under-
stand my problem. W h o cares about you? T h e problem is if I don't find 
my ticket, then I don't k n o w where I am going. It is written on the 
ticket. So are you going to decide for me? I am in such trouble, the ticket 
has to be found." 
T h e ticket checker must have been taken aback—this was a strange 
situation. Shaw was not worried about being caught without a ticket, his 
worry was far deeper. N o w the question was, w h e r e was he going? A n d 
because he could not find the ticket he had to go back h o m e on the next 
train. He could not bring to his m e m o r y the place he was going to. 
But for the most part, each m o m e n t intelligence is needed, not memory 
My o w n understanding is that if we want to make humanity m o r e 
conscious, m o r e alert, m o r e enlightened, then the emphasis has to be 
taken away from m e m o r y ; the emphasis has to be put on intelligence. 
But for universities, for professors, for pedagogues, emphasis on 
m e m o r y is simpler. You just ask five questions and if the person can 
memorize the books, he can answer them. 
My own professor was very m u c h worried—because he loved me so 
171

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
1 1 2 
much—because I never bothered about the prescribed books. A n d he was 
so concerned: "Unless you answer exactly what is written in the books, it 
will be a great shock to all of us. You have the capacity to top the whole 
university, but the way you are behaving you cannot even pass." 
I said, " D o n ' t be worried." But he was so concerned that he used to 
come early in the m o r n i n g to pick me up from the hostel and take me to 
the examination hall. He was not certain whether I would go or not, 
whether I would remember to go or not. A n d he would stand there until 
I had gone in and he would tell every examiner, "Keep an eye on this 
student, don't let h i m get out of the hall before the three hours are over, 
because he may answer within one h o u r and be gone. Force him, 
whether he has answered or not, to be here for three hours." 
I said, "This is strange . . ." But the examiners listened to h i m be-
cause he was also the dean of the Faculty of Arts. 
All my professors, my vice chancellors, everybody was so surprised 
w h e n I topped the university and got the gold medal. N o b o d y was ex-
pecting that. But a coincidence—one of the most famous professors of 
Allahabad University, Professor R a n a d e . . . It was well k n o w n that in his 
life he had given only two persons first class. Those two were the bare 
m i n i m u m . Otherwise it was very difficult even to get passing marks from 
him. A n d he was thought to be not only a professor but a sage. He had 
written great books with great insight; there was no doubt about his in-
tellectual acumen. Just by coincidence my papers reached his hands. And 
he wrote a note, w h i c h the vice chancellor showed to me because Profes-
sor R a n a d e had written, "This note should be shown to the student." He 
said, "You are the only person in my life w h o has fulfilled my desire. I al-
ways hated memorized answers; your answers are so fresh and so short, to 
the point. You are n o t a m a n of memory. I wanted to give you a hundred 
percent, but that may look a little suspicious—perhaps I am favoring 
you—that's w h y I am giving you ninety-nine percent. But if you happen 
to come to Allahabad any time, I would love to meet you. In my whole 
lifelong career as a professor, I have been waiting for you. I wanted these

kinds of answers. I wanted this courage—rather than answering the 
question, you questioned the question and you demolished the question 
completely. You have not answered it because there is nothing to answer; 
the question is absurd. A n d w h e n you answer a question, you answer to 
the point. I don't want to read long answers, w h i c h are all repetitive. 
Everybody else is writing them, n o b o d y is using his intelligence." 
He was aware of the fact that m e m o r y is only mechanical; intelli-
gence is your real treasure. A n d n o w it has become an absolute fact. In 
the future, m e m o r y will not be used at all, because you can carry a small 
computer in a pocket with all the answers for all the questions that can be 
asked. Even absurd questions . . . for example, on what day Socrates was 
married. Or, w h o was the first m a n to use the b o w and arrow. Every-
thing can be ready-made. You can get any answer from the computer. 
A n d computers can be so small that you can keep them in your 
pocket. T h e y can be so small that you can make just a wristwatch out of 
them. On the surface it will look like a wristwatch, but deep d o w n it is 
carrying all the answers that you need. Just ask the question and the an-
swer is there. 
You don't have to be w o r r i e d about your memory. W h a t is essential 
is intelligence. A n d the w h o l e energy should move toward intelligence. It 
will make you feel very light. A n d as far as m e m o r y is concerned, just use 
a notebook. Anything essential, fundamental, just note it down. T h e n 
there is no leakage. Leakage as such never happens. 
Paddy, Sean, and Mick were out hunting one day w h e n they 
came u p o n some tracks. After looking at them closely, Paddy 
said, "Those are bear tracks." 
" N o , no," said Sean, "those are deer tracks." 
"Hey, Mick," they both asked, "what do you think they are?" 
But before he could answer, all three were hit by a train. 
Intelligence is going to be the savior, not memory.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
How can 
lovers 
behave 
more intelligently? 
W h e n you have moved in deep relationship with somebody, a great need 
arises to be alone. You start feeling spent, exhausted, tired—-joyously tired, 
happily tired, but each excitement is exhausting. It was tremendously 
beautiful to relate, but n o w you would like to move into aloneness, so that 
you can again gather yourself together, so that again you can become 
overflowing, so that again you become rooted in your o w n being. 
In love you moved into the other's being, you lost contact with 
yourself. You became drowned, drunk. N o w you will need to find your-
self again. But w h e n you are alone, you are again creating a need for love. 
Soon you will be so full that you would like to share, you will be so over-
flowing that you would like somebody to p o u r yourself into, to w h o m to 
give of yourself. Love arises out of aloneness. 
Aloneness makes you overfull. Love receives your gifts. Love empties 
you so that you can b e c o m e full again. W h e n e v e r you are emptied by 
love, aloneness is there to nourish you, to integrate you. A n d this is a 
rhythm. 
Make your w o m a n or your m a n also alert to the rhythm. People 
should be taught that nobody can love twenty-four hours a day; rest pe-
riods are needed. A n d nobody can love on order. Love is a spontaneous 
p h e n o m e n o n : W h e n e v e r it happens, it happens, and whenever it doesn't 
happen it doesn't happen. N o t h i n g can be done about it. If you DO any-
thing, you will create a pseudo p h e n o m e n o n , an acting. 
Real lovers, intelligent lovers, will make each other alert to the phe-
n o m e n o n : " W h e n I want to be alone that does not mean that I am reject-
ing you. In fact, it is because of your love that you have made it possible 
for me to be alone." A n d if your w o m a n wants to be left alone for one 
night, for a few days, you will not feel hurt. You will not say that you 
have been rejected, that your love has not been received and welcomed. 
You will respect her decision to be alone for a few days. In fact, you will 
be happy! Your love was so m u c h that she is feeling empty; n o w she needs 
rest to become full again. 
174

This is intelligence. 
Ordinarily, you think you are rejected. You go to your w o m a n , and 
if she is not willing to be with you, or not very loving to you, you feel 
great rejection. Your ego is hurt. This ego is not a very intelligent thing. 
All egos are idiotic. Intelligence knows no ego; intelligence simply sees 
the p h e n o m e n o n , tries to understand w h y 
the w o m a n does n o t want to be with you. 
N o t that she is rejecting y o u — y o u k n o w 
she has loved you so much, she loves you 
so m u c h — b u t this is a m o m e n t she wants 
to be alone. A n d if you love her, you will 
leave her alone; you will not torture her, 
you will not force her to make love to you. 
A n d if the m a n wants to be alone, the 
w o m a n will not think, " H e is no longer 
interested in m e — m a y b e he has b e c o m e 
interested in some other w o m a n . " An i n -
telligent w o m a n will leave the m a n alone, 
so he can again gather together his being, 
so that again he has energy to share. A n d 
this rhythm is like day and night, summer 
and winter; it goes on changing. 
A n d 
if 
two 
persons 
are 
really 
respectful—-and love is always respectful, it 
reveres the other, it is a very worshipful, 
prayerful state—then slowly you will under-
stand each other more and more. A n d you will become aware of the other's 
rhythm and your rhythm. A n d soon you will find that out of love, out of 
respect, your rhythms are coming closer and closer: W h e n you feel loving, 
she feels loving. This settles. This settles on its own. It is a synchronicity. 
Have you watched ever? If you come across two real lovers, you will 
see m a n y things similar in them. Real lovers become as if they are broth-
ers and sisters. You will be surprised—even brothers and sisters are n o t so 
175

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
176 
alike. Their expressions, their ways of walking, their ways of talking, their 
gestures—two lovers become alike, and yet so different. This naturally 
starts happening. Just being together, slowly they become attuned to each 
other. R e a l lovers need not say anything to the other—the other i m m e -
diately understands, intuitively understands. 
If the w o m a n is sad, she may not say it is so, but the m a n understands 
and leaves her alone. If the m a n is sad, the w o m a n understands and leaves 
h i m alone—finds some excuse to leave h i m alone. Stupid people do just 
the opposite: T h e y never leave each other alone—they are constantly 
with each other, tiring and boring each other; never leaving any space for 
the other to be. 
Love gives freedom and love helps the other to be himself or herself. 
Love is a very paradoxical p h e n o m e n o n . In one way it makes you one 
soul in two bodies; in another way it gives you individuality, uniqueness. 
It helps you to drop your small selves, but it also helps you to attain to the 
supreme self. T h e n there is no problem: Love and meditation are two 
wings, and they balance each other. A n d between the two you grow. 
Sometimes 
I have 
doubts 
about 
my 
intelligence. 
D o n ' t start thinking that if you are not intelligent, then what? Everybody 
is b o r n intelligent. Intelligence is an intrinsic quality—just as everybody is 
b o r n breathing, everybody is b o r n intelligent. 
T h e idea that a few people are intelligent and a few are not is utterly 
w r o n g — a n d has been dehumanizing many, many people. It is very insult-
ing, degrading. All are born intelligent, although their intelligences may 
differ in their expressions. O n e is intelligent in music, another is intelligent 
in mathematics, but if you make mathematics the criterion then the musi-
cian looks unintelligent. If you put them both into one examination where 
mathematics is the criterion, the musician fails. C h a n g e the criterion, 
let music be the criterion, and put them both into the examination where 
music will decide, then the mathematician looks stupid.

We have chosen certain criteria; that's w h y many people have been 
condemned as stupid—they are not. I have never come across a single per-
son w h o is stupid—it does not h a p p e n — 
but his intelligence may be a different kind 
of intelligence. Poetry needs a different 
kind of intelligence than being in business. 
A poet cannot be a businessman, and the 
businessman will find it very difficult to be 
a poet. O n e kind of intelligence is needed 
in being a politician, another kind of intel-
ligence is needed in being a painter. And 
there are millions of possibilities. 
R e m e m b e r : Everyone is b o r n intelli-
gent, so that is not excluding anybody. You 
just have to find your intelligence—where 
it is. A n d once you have found your intel-
ligence you will be clear. 
People are living with unclarity because they are living with w r o n g 
ideas about themselves. Somebody has told you—a teacher, a professor, an 
employer—that you are not intelligent. But their criterion is only a c h o -
1 sen criterion; their criterion is not applicable to all. T h e universities are 
not yet universal. T h e y don't allow every kind of intelligence, they don't 
accept all manifestations of intelligence. 
O n c e you have accepted your intelligence and you start respecting it, 
you will become clear; there will be no problem. 
T h e poet feels stupid because he cannot be a good businessman. N o w 
this creates confusion. He becomes inferior in his own eyes, disrespectful, 
condemning. He tries to succeed in business but he cannot. This creates 
great smoke around him. If he simply understands that he is a poet and he 
is not meant to be a businessman, and to succeed as a businessman will be a 
suicide to him, he has to succeed as a p o e t . . . That is his intelligence, and 
his intelligence has to flower in his o w n way. He has not to imitate anybody 
else. Maybe the society will not pay for it, because poetry is not needed as

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
178 
m u c h as bombs are needed. Love is not needed as m u c h as hatred is needed. 
That's w h y in the films, on the radio, on the television, murder is al-
lowed; it is not called obscene. But lovemaking is called obscene. This so-
ciety lives through hate not through love. If somebody is murdering, it is 
perfectly okay. If somebody puts a dagger into your heart and the blood 
rushes like a fountain, it is perfectly okay. But if somebody hugs you, kisses 
you, loves you, the society is afraid. 
This is strange, that love is obscene and murder is not, that lovers are 
c o n d e m n e d and soldiers rewarded, that war is right and love is wrong. 
If you accept your intelligence, if you accept yourself, you will be-
come clear, absolutely clear; all clouds will disappear. 
How can 
I support 
my 
own growth 
of intelligence? 
First become more and more alert in small things. Walking along the road, 
become more alert, try to be more alert. For such a simple process as walk-
ing along the road you need not have any alertness. You can remain stupid 
and walk well. That's what everyone is doing. T h e stupidity does not hin-
der you at all. Start from small things. Taking your bath, be alert; standing 
under the shower, become very alert. That cold water falling on you, the 
body enjoying i t . . . become alert, become conscious of what is happening, 
be relaxed yet conscious. 
A n d this m o m e n t of consciousness has to be brought in again and 
again, in a thousand and one ways: eating, talking, meeting a friend, lis-
tening to me, meditating, making love. In all situations try to become 
m o r e and m o r e alert. It is hard, it is certainly difficult, but it is not im-
possible. Slowly, slowly, the dust will disappear and your mirrorlike con-
sciousness will reveal itself; you will b e c o m e m o r e intelligent. 
T h e n live intelligently. You live in such a confused way, in such a stu-
pid way, that if you saw somebody else living that way you would immedi-
ately say that he is stupid. But you are doing the same, although somehow 
one manages not to look at one's o w n life.

A m a n came to me and he said, " W h a t to do, Osho? I have fallen in 
love with two w o m e n . " N o w one is enough, one will do enough harm, 
but he has fallen in love with t w o w o m e n . So b o t h are struggling and he 
is crushed. A n d he says, "I am in misery. B o t h are fighting over me." 
A n d naturally from b o t h sides he is being hit! A n d if I say to him, 
" C h o o s e one," he says that it is difficult. This means that one person is 
riding on two horses. He says it is difficult to choose one. T h e n let it be, 
have it your o w n way. You will destroy your life. Choosing two w o m e n 
or t w o m e n as your love objects is b o u n d to split you. You will start 
falling apart. 
This is stupid. It is so simple to look into the p h e n o m e n o n . Maybe 
sometimes it is difficult—it is difficult—but then too one has to choose. 
You cannot go in all the directions simultaneously. 
If you look, into your life you will find h o w unintelligently you 
have been behaving. You read a b o o k and you accumulate k n o w l -
edge and you start thinking that you know. You have learned the w o r d 
God and you think you have k n o w n God. You are ready to a r g u e — n o t 
only argue, you are ready to kill and be killed. H o w many M o -
hammedans, h o w m a n y Hindus, h o w many Christians, have been killed 
for something they have read only in a book! Tremendously stupid p e o -
ple. O n e is fighting for the Koran, another is fighting for the Gita, an-
other is fighting for the Bible—for books you are fighting and killing 
living people and sacrificing your tremendously valuable life! W h a t are 
you doing? 
But man has behaved in stupid ways. Just because everybody else is b e -
having in the same way does not make it intelligent. If all are fools it does 
not make you intelligent because you are following them. 
I have heard. 
A flock of birds was flying into the sky and one bird asked 
another, " W h y do we always follow this stupid leader?" 
A n d the other said, "I don't know. I have heard that only he 
has the map." 
179

T h e map! N o b o d y has the map. But you go on following the pope, 
the Shankaracharya, the pundit, the politician, and you think they have 
the map, you think they know. Just look 
into their lives—what do they know? They 
may even be far m o r e stupid than you are. 
Just look at the unintelligent way they are 
living. Watch their life. Are they happy? Is 
there a dance in their life? Is there fra-
grance in their life? Just looking at t h e m do 
you 
feel 
a silence 
showering 
on you? 
N o t h i n g of the sort. Just because they have 
a b o o k and they have read it and studied it 
for years, it does not make any sense to fol-
low them. 
Become a person of knowing, not a 
person of knowledge. T h e n you live intel-
ligendy. 
To me intelligence is the basic moral-
ity, the basic virtue. If you are intelligent 
you will not h a r m anybody because that is 
foolish. If you are intelligent you will not 
h a r m yourself because that is foolish. Life 
is so precious, it is not to be wasted; it has 
to be lived in deep celebration, in deep 
gratitude. 
A n d one has to be very careful and 
watchful because a m o m e n t gone is gone forever. It will never return. So 
if you waste it in stupidity you are wasting a great opportunity. Live each 
m o m e n t so totally, so fully aware, that you never repent later on that you 
didn't live, that you could have lived more, that you could have enjoyed 
more. That's what intelligence is: to live life so totally that there is no re-
pentance, ever. O n e is always contented. O n e knows that one has lived to 
one's utmost.

here is a switch in the mind. T h e name of the switch is watchful-
ness, awareness, witnessing. If you start witnessing the m i n d it b e -
gins to stop. T h e m o r e that witnessing grows, the m o r e and more 
do you become aware of a secret key, that the m i n d can be stopped easily. 
A n d that m o m e n t is of great Liberation, w h e n you can turn the m i n d off 
for hours. A n d w h e n it comes back, w h e n you recall it, it comes back re-
juvenated, fresh. 
H e n c e meditators are b o u n d to be m o r e intelligent than other p e o -
ple. If they are not then their meditation is false, then they don't k n o w 
w h a t meditation is; they are doing something else in the name of m e d i -
tation. A meditative person is b o u n d to be m o r e sensitive, m o r e intelli-
gent, m o r e creative, m o r e loving, m o r e compassionate. These qualities 
grow of their o w n accord. A n d the w h o l e secret is in one thing: Learn 
to stop the mind. T h e m o m e n t you k n o w h o w to stop the m i n d you 
b e c o m e the master, and then m i n d is a beautiful mechanism. You use it 
w h e n you want to use it, w h e n it is needed, and you put it off w h e n it is 
not needed. 
181

W h a t is meditation? Is it a technique that can be practiced? Is it an effort 
that you have to do? Is it something which the m i n d can achieve? It 
is not. 
All that the m i n d can do cannot be meditation—it is something b e -
yond the mind, the m i n d is absolutely helpless there. T h e m i n d cannot 
penetrate meditation; where m i n d ends, 
meditation begins. This has to be r e m e m -
bered, because in our life, whatsoever we 
do, we do through the mind; whatsoever 
we achieve, we achieve through the mind. 
A n d then, w h e n we turn inward, we again 
start 
thinking 
in 
terms 
of techniques, 
methods, doings, because the w h o l e of 
life's experience shows us that everything 
can be done by the mind. Yes. Except 
meditation, everything can be done by the 
mind; everything is done by the m i n d ex-
cept meditation. Because meditation is not 
an achievement—it is already the case, it is 
your nature. It has not to be achieved; it 
has only to be recognized, it has only to be 
remembered. It is there waiting for you-— 
just a turning in, and it is available. You 
have been carrying it always and always. 
Meditation is your intrinsic nature—it 
is you, it is your being, it has nothing to do 
with your doings. You cannot have it, you 
cannot not have it, it cannot be possessed. It 
is not a thing. It is you. It is your being. 
O n c e you understand what meditation is things b e c o m e very clear. 
Otherwise, you can go on groping in the dark. 
182

Meditation is a state of clarity, not a state of mind. M i n d is confu-
sion. M i n d is never clear. It cannot be. Thoughts create clouds around 
y o u — t h e y are subtle clouds. A mist is created by them, and the clarity is 
lost. W h e n thoughts disappear, w h e n there are no m o r e clouds around 
you, w h e n you are in your simple beingness, clarity happens. T h e n you 
can see far away; then you can see to the very end of existence; then your 
gaze becomes penetrating—to the very core of being. 
Meditation is clarity, absolute clarity, of vision. You cannot think 
about it. You have to drop thinking. W h e n I say, "You have to drop 
thinking," don't conclude in a hurry, because I have to use language. So 
I say, " D r o p thinking," but if you start dropping you will miss, because 
again you will reduce it to a doing. 
" D r o p thinking" simply means: D o n ' t do anything. Sit. Let thoughts 
settle themselves. Let m i n d drop of its o w n accord. You just sit gazing at 
the wall, in a silent corner, n o t doing anything at all. Relaxed. Loose. 
W i t h no effort. N o t going anywhere. As if you are falling asleep a w a k e — 
you are awake and you are relaxing but the w h o l e body is falling into 
sleep. You remain alert inside but the w h o l e body moves into deep r e -
laxation. 
T h o u g h t s settle of their o w n accord, you need not j u m p a m o n g 
them, you need not try to put t h e m right. It is as if a stream has b e c o m e 
m u d d y . . . what do you do? Do you j u m p in it and start helping the 
stream to become clear? You will make it m o r e muddy. You simply sit on 
the bank. You wait. There is nothing to be done. Because whatsoever 
jyou do will make the stream m o r e muddy. If somebody has passed 
through a stream and the dead leaves have surfaced and the m u d has 
arisen, just patience is needed. You simply sit on the bank. Watch, indif-
ferently. A n d as the stream goes on flowing, the dead leaves will be taken 
away, and the m u d will start settling because it cannot hang forever. 
After a while, suddenly you will b e c o m e aware—the stream is crys-
tal clear again. 
W h e n e v e r a desire passes through your m i n d the stream becomes 
widely. So just sit. D o n ' t try to do anything. In Japan this "just sitting" is 
183

called Zazen; just sitting and doing nothing. A n d one day, meditation 
happens. N o t that you bring it to you; it comes to you. A n d w h e n it 
comes, you immediately recognize it; it has been always there but you 
were not looking in the right direction. T h e treasure has been with you but 
you were occupied somewhere else: in thoughts, in desires, in a thousand 
and one things. You were riot interested in the only one thing . . . and 
that was your o w n being. 
R e m e m b e r , meditation will bring you m o r e and m o r e intelligence, 
infinite intelligence, a radiant intelligence. Meditation will make you 
m o r e alive and sensitive; your life will become richer. 
You can go into meditation just by sitting, but then be just sitting; do not 
do anything else. If you can be just sitting, it becomes meditation. Be 
completely in the sitting; n o n m o v e m e n t should be your only movement. 
In fact, the w o r d Zen com.es from the w o r d Zazen, w h i c h means, just sit-
ting, doing nothing. If you can just sit, doing nothing with your body 
and nothing with your mind, it becomes meditation; but it is difficult. 
You can sit very easily w h e n you are doing something else, but the 
m o m e n t you are just sitting and doing nothing, it becomes a problem. 
Every fiber of the b o d y begins to move inside; every vein, every muscle, 
begins to move. You will begin to feel a subtle trembling; you will be 
aware of m a n y points in the body of w h i c h you have never been aware 
before. A n d the m o r e you try to just sit, the m o r e m o v e m e n t you will 
feel inside you. So sitting can be used only if you have done other things 
first. 
You can just walk, that is easier. You can just dance, that is even eas-
ier. A n d after you have been doing other things that are easier, then you 
can sit. Sitting in a buddha posture is the last thing to do, really; it should 
never be done in the beginning. O n l y after you have begun to feel iden-
tified totally with movement can you begin to feel totally identified with 
nonmovement. 
So I never tell people to begin w i t h just sitting. Begin from where 
184

b e g i n n i n g is 
easy, otherwise you will begin to feel m a n y things 
unnecessarily—things that are n o t there. 
If you begin with sitting, you will feel m u c h disturbance inside. T h e 
m o r e you try to just sit, the m o r e disturbance will be felt; you will become 
aware only of your insane m i n d and nothing else. It will create depression, 
you will feel frustrated. You will not feel blissful; rather, you will begin to 
feel that you are insane. A n d sometimes you may really go insane. 
If you make a sincere effort to "just sit," you may really go insane. 
O n l y because people do not really try sincerely does insanity not happen 
m o r e often. W i t h a sitting posture you begin to k n o w so m u c h madness 
inside you that if you are sincere and continue it, you may really go in-
sane. It has happened before, so m a n y times; so I never suggest anything 
that can create frustration, depression, sadness—anything that will allow 
you to be too aware of your insanity. You may not be ready to be aware 
of all the insanity that is inside you; you must be allowed to get to k n o w 
certain things gradually. Knowledge is not always good; it must unfold it-
self slowly as your capacity to absorb it grows. 
I begin with your insanity, not with a sitting posture; I allow your in-
sanity. If you dance madly, the opposite happens within you. W i t h a m a d 
dance, you begin to be aware of a silent point within you; with sitting 
silently, you begin to be aware of madness. T h e opposite is always the 
point of awareness. W i t h your dancing madly, chaotically, with crying, 
with chaotic breathing, I allow your madness. T h e n you begin to be 
aware of a subtle point, a deep point inside you w h i c h is silent and still, 
in contrast to the madness on the periphery. You will feel very blissful; at 
your center there is an inner silence. But if you are just sitting, then the 
inner one is the m a d one; you are silent on the outside, but inside you are 
mad. 
If you begin with something active—something positive, alive, 
moving—it will be better; then you will begin to feel an inner stillness 
[growing. T h e m o r e it grows, the m o r e it will be possible for you to use a 
sitting posture or a lying posture—the m o r e silent meditation will be 
possible. But by then things will be different, totally different. 
185

A meditation technique that begins with movement, action, helps 
you in other ways, also. It becomes a catharsis. W h e n you are just sitting, 
you are frustrated; your mind wants to move and you are just sitting. Every 
muscle turns, every nerve turns. You are trying to force something upon 
yourself that is not natural for you; then you have divided yourself into 
the one w h o is forcing and the one w h o is being forced. A n d really, the 
part that is being forced and suppressed is the m o r e authentic part; it is a 
m o r e major part of your m i n d than the part that is suppressing, and the 
major part is b o u n d to win. 
That w h i c h you are suppressing is really to be thrown, not sup-
pressed. It has become an accumulation within you because you have 
been constantly suppressing it. T h e w h o l e upbringing, the civilization, 
the education, is suppressive. You have been suppressing m u c h that could 
have been thrown very easily with a different education, with a more 
conscious education, with a m o r e aware parenthood. W i t h a better 
awareness of the inner mechanism of the mind, the culture could have al-
lowed you to throw many things. 
For example, w h e n a child is angry we tell him, " D o not be angry." 
He begins to suppress anger. By and by, what was a momentary happening 
becomes permanent. N o w he will not act angry, but he will remain angry. 
We have accumulated so m u c h anger from what were just momentary 
things; no one can be angry continuously unless anger has been suppressed. 
Anger is a momentary thing that comes and goes: If it is expressed, then 
you are no longer angry. So with me, I would allow the child to be angry 
more authentically. Be angry, but be deep in it; do not suppress it. 
Of course, there will be problems. If we say, "Be angry," then you 
are going to be angry at someone. But a child can be molded; he can be 
given a pillow and told, "Be angry with the pillow. Be violent with the 
pillow." From the very beginning, a child can be brought up in a way in 
w h i c h the anger is just deviated. Some object can be given to him: He 
can go on throwing the object until his anger goes. W i t h i n minutes, 
within seconds, he will have dissipated his anger and there will be no ac-
cumulation of it. 
186

You have accumulated anger, sex, violence, greed, everything! N o w 
this accumulation is a madness within you. It is there, inside you. If you 
begin with any suppressive meditation—for example, with just sitting— 
you are suppressing all of this, you are not allowing it to be released. So 
I begin with a catharsis. First, let the suppressions be thrown into the 
air; and w h e n you can throw your anger into the air, you have become 
mature. 
If I cannot be loving alone, if I can be loving only with someone I 
love, then, really, I am not mature yet. T h e n I am depending on someone 
even to be loving; someone must be there, then I can be loving. T h e n that 
loving can only be a very superficial thing; it is not my nature. If I am 
alone in the r o o m I am not loving at all, so the loving quality has not 
gone deep; it has not b e c o m e a part of my being. 
You b e c o m e m o r e and m o r e mature w h e n you are less and less d e -
pendent. If you can be angry alone, you are more mature. You do not 
need any object to be angry. So I make a catharsis in the beginning a 
must. You must throw everything into the sky, into the open space, w i t h -
out being conscious of any object. 
Be angry without the person with w h o m you would like to be an-
gry. Weep without finding any cause; laugh, just laugh, without anything 
to laugh at. T h e n you can just throw the w h o l e accumulated thing—you 
can just throw it. A n d once you k n o w the way, you are unburdened of 
the whole past. 
W i t h i n moments you can be unburdened of the w h o l e life—of lives 
even. If you are ready to throw everything, if you can allow your m a d -
ness to come out, within moments there is a deep cleansing. N o w you are 
cleansed: fresh, innocent—you are a child again. Now, in your innocence, 
sitting meditation can be done—just sitting, or just lying, or anything— 
because n o w there is no mad one inside to disturb the sitting. 
Cleansing must be the first thing—a catharsis—otherwise, with 
breathing exercises, with just sitting, with practicing yoga asanas, postures, 
you are just suppressing something. 
W h e n silence comes to you, w h e n it descends on you, it is not a false 
187

thing. You have not been cultivating it; it comes to you; it happens to 
you. You begin to feel it growing inside you just like a m o t h e r begins to 
feel a child growing. A deep silence is growing inside you; you become 
pregnant with it. O n l y then is there transformation; otherwise it is just 
self-deception. A n d one can deceive oneself for lives and lives—the ca-
pacity to do so is infinite. 
Intelligence can be rediscovered. T h e only m e t h o d to rediscover it is 
meditation. Meditation only does one thing: It destroys all the barriers 
that the society has created to prevent you from being intelligent. It sim-
ply removes the blocks. Its function is negative: It removes the rocks that 
are preventing your waters from flowing, your springs from becoming 
alive. Everybody is carrying the great potential, but society has put great 
rocks to prevent it. It has created China Walls around you; it has impris-
oned you. 
If you are a Christian you are imprisoned by the Christian priests. If 
you are a H i n d u you are imprisoned by H i n d u priests. Your prisons are 
different; maybe their architecture is different, the rooms are made differ-
ently, with different material. A n d maybe a few prisons are m o r e c o m -
fortable than others, more sophisticated than others. 
Of course the 
American prison is better than the Indian prison, far better, m o r e c o m -
fortable: the radio is available, the TV is available to the prisoner. T h e 
Indian prison is b o u n d to be Indian. Indians are living in such an u n -
comfortable way, h o w can they provide television and radio and comfort 
to the prisoners? Impossible. T h e y are there to be punished; they cannot 
be allowed to enjoy. 
Christianity may be a little better prison than M o h a m m e d a n i s m , but 
a prison is a prison. A n d in fact a better prison is far m o r e dangerous be-
cause you may start clinging to it, you may not like to get out of it; you 
may start loving it as if it is your home. But these are all prisons. 
A n d sometimes people get fed up with one prison and they change 
their prisons. T h e H i n d u becomes the Christian, the Christian becomes 
188

the Hindu. N o w there are many foolish Christians w h o have b e c o m e 
Hare Krishna people—the same stupidity but masquerading in a n e w 
form. There are many Hindus w h o have become Christians, but the same 
superstitiousness persists; there is no difference at all. I have seen those 
Hindus w h o have become Christians—no change. I have seen those Chris-
tians w h o have become H i n d u s — n o change. They have just changed the 
prison. 
To come out of all prisons is intelligence—and never to get into an-
other again. Intelligence can be discovered through meditation because 
all those prisons exist in your mind. They cannot reach your being, for-
tunately. T h e y cannot pollute your being, they can only pollute your 
m i n d — t h e y can only cover your mind. If you can get out of the m i n d 
you will get out of Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and all 
kinds of rubbish will be just finished. You can come to a full stop. 
A n d w h e n you are out of the mind, watching it, being aware of it, 
just being a witness, you are intelligent. Your intelligence is discovered. 
You have undone w h a t the society has done to you; you have destroyed 
the mischief; you have destroyed the conspiracy of the priests and the 
politicians. You have c o m e out of it, you are free. In fact, you are for 
the first time a real h u m a n being, an authentic h u m a n being. N o w the 
whole sky is yours.

O
sho's teachings defy categorization, covering everything from 
the individual quest for meaning to the most urgent social and 
political issues facing society today. His books are not written 
but are transcribed from audio and video recordings of extemporaneous 
talks given to international audiences over a period of thirty-five years. 
Osho has been described by the Sunday Times in L o n d o n as one of the 
"1,000 Makers of the 20th C e n t u r y " and by American author T o m 
R o b b i n s as "the most dangerous m a n since Jesus Christ." 
About his o w n w o r k O s h o has said that he is helping to create the 
conditions for the birth of a n e w kind of h u m a n being. He has often 
characterized this n e w h u m a n being as " Z o r b a the Buddha"—capable of 
enjoying both the earthy pleasures of a Zorba the Greek and the silent 
serenity of a Gautam Buddha. R u n n i n g like a thread through all aspects 
of Osho's w o r k is a vision that encompasses both the timeless wisdom of 
the East and the highest potential of Western science and technology. 
O s h o is also k n o w n for his revolutionary contribution to the science 
of inner transformation, with an approach to meditation that acknowl-
edges the accelerated pace of contemporary life. His unique "Active 
Meditations" are designed to first release the accumulated stresses of 
body and mind, so that it is easier to experience the thought-free and re-
laxed state of meditation.

T
he O s h o Meditation Resort is a place where people can have a di-
rect personal experience of a n e w way of living with m o r e alert-
ness, relaxation, and fun. 
Located about one hundred miles 
southeast of M u m b a i in Pune, India, the resort offers a variety of pro-
grams to thousands of people w h o visit each year from m o r e than a h u n -
dred countries around the world. 
Originally developed as a summer retreat for maharajas and wealthy 
British colonialists, P u n e is n o w a thriving m o d e r n city that is h o m e to a 
n u m b e r of universities and high-tech industries. T h e meditation resort 
spreads over forty acres in a tree-lined suburb k n o w n as Koregaon Park. 
T h e resort campus provides accommodation for a limited n u m b e r of 
guests, and there is a plentiful variety of nearby hotels and private apart-
ments available for stays of a few days up to several months. 
Resort programs are all based on the O s h o vision of a qualitatively 
n e w kind of h u m a n being w h o is able both to participate creatively in 
everyday life and to relax into silence and meditation. Most programs 
take place in m o d e r n , air-conditioned facilities and include a variety of 
individual sessions, courses, and workshops covering everything from 
creative arts to holistic health treatments, personal transformation and 
therapy, esoteric sciences, the " Z e n " approach to sports and recreation, 
relationship issues, and significant life transitions for m e n and w o m e n . In-
dividual sessions and group workshops are offered throughout the year, 
alongside a full daily schedule of meditations. 
193

O u t d o o r cafes and restaurants within the resort grounds serve both 
traditional Indian fare and a choice of international dishes, all made with 
organically grown vegetables from the commune's o w n farm. T h e cam-
pus has its o w n private supply of safe, filtered water.

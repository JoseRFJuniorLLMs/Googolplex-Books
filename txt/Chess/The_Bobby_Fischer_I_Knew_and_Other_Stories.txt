Foreword 
'Ihe Moves of the People 
By Grandmaster Larry Evans 
Five-time U.S. Chess Champion 
"It's not the moves of the pieces but of the people that 
interest me."-Tim Rice, author of the musical Chess. 
Although more books have been written about chess than any other 
game, there are very few good chess memoirs-and nothing quite 
like The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories. 
Arnold Denker is a superb raconteur and famous grandmaster 
whose chess career spanned seven decades from Alekhine to 
Kasparov. He teamed up with former Chess Life editor Larry Parr, a 
graceful stylist and tireless researcher, to produce this sparkling 
memoir containing pen portraits of some of the most raucous and 
colorful figures in 20th century chess. I knew many of them and 
often catch myself saying, "Yes, they got it just right!" 
There is George Treysman's face "like the death mask of a Mon­
gol warrior." Or young Bobby Fischer's habit of never looking up 
from the board as if "he had perhaps dropped something and was 
still looking for it." Or Albert Pinkus, a mild-mannered New York 
master whose hobby was collecting chess books. Until now, how­
ever, I never knew that he was also the Indiana Jones of chess who 
sought "fame and glory in the darkest regions of South America­
places with lazy, muddy rivers and ill-shaven soldiers of fortune who 
wear white suits and Panama hats, and who travel on tramp steam­
ers into desolate green hells." 
Denker and Parr have a photographic eye for the telling detail; 
and they possess a gift for sifting among a thousand trivial events to 
find the one or two that somehow capture the essence of a person's 
life. For example, take their treatment of Herman Steiner, "the hot 
Hollywood hunk of chess." Herman took me and other young chess

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
talents under his wing in the 1940s, but I was sufficiently ungrateful 
to defeat him in a match for the U.S. Championship in 1952. On the 
set of the movie Cass Timberlane, he got away with telling Lana 
Turner, "Don't play chess. Sitting at a chess board for hours might 
make you fat and spoil that perfect figure." That was Herman. He 
was a ladykiller. 
This work recalls a world now lost: leisurely dinner parties at the 
Savoy with Max Euwe; elegant evenings at the penthouse of chess 
patron Maurice Wertheim; carousing at bistros with Alexander 
Alekhine; long, lazy afternoons at the Manhattan Chess Club with 
Oscar Tenner, Al Simonson, and so many others who are now faded 
memories of my chess youth in Manhattan-not to mention the 
likes of Ossip Bernstein, Salo Flohr and Miguel Najdorf. 
The Damon Runyons of Chess 
Denker and Parr remind me a lot of Damon Runyon as they recreate 
the lives and foibles of the "guys and dolls" of New York chess. Not 
only do they chronicle giants like Reuben Fine, Bobby Fischer, 
Isaac Kashdan and Sammy Reshevsky-all of whom I had the pleas­
ure (and pain) to face across the board-they also describe such pe­
ripheral figures as Irving Chernev (the Ripley of chess), who would 
buttonhole me with a new chess study to solve whenever we en­
countered each other at a chess club. Or the ratty Norman Whitaker 
(of Lindbergh-kidnapping infamy). During the U.S. Open in 1946 I 
asked him to take me to see The Outlaw with Jane Russell, a movie 
considered too racy for minors unless they were accompanied by an 
adult. He gladly obliged. 
There is also plenty of hard chess-about 300 games, many 
hitherto unpublished, with interesting theoretical ideas that have ei­
ther been forgotten or neglected in opening manuals. Yet the core of 
the book is about people Denker knew and often loved. His own life 
is skilfully intertwined with the funny and sad, tragic and heart­
warming fates of men who often dedicated 30, 40, SO, 60 years to 
the ludicrous task of "cornering a wooden king on a wooden 
board," as Stefan Zweig put it in The Royal Game. 
A Haunting Memorial 
This book radiates life. So many people in these pages, shades of the 
past, seem to emerge from the walls to take one last bow. They in­
evitably step backwards into the walls as their figures recede, for 
even Denker and Parr cannot indefinitely hold open the door of 
memory. 
Arnold Denker appears to be genuinely fascinated by these

people. He renders their features with a Dickensian precision, and 
no chess writer ever had a sharper eye for the compelling detail. Un­
like so many of his fellow grandmasters, Denker can see beyond the 
end of his own nose. How fortunate for us that he and his collabo­
rator have the rare gift to tell it like it was.

I ntroduction 
cBabbitts and cBotl/inniks 
Not too long ago-oh, just five or six decades back-the Manhattan 
Chess Club was considered to be the strongest aggregation of chess 
players in the world. Winning a Manhattan club championship was 
the equivalent of finishing first in a strong international tournament. 
The great men of the Manhattan made up a Who's Who of world 
chess. They included the likes of Jose Capablanca (who kept an 
apartment just across the way at 157 West 57th Street) and Isaac 
Kashdan, Sammy Reshevsky and Reuben Fine, Herman Steiner and 
AI Simonson, Arthur Dake and AI Horowitz-well, you get the idea. 
Unfortunately, Capablanca seldom deigned to play with us Young 
Turks and usually confined his activities to giving Knight odds to AI 
Link and Charlie Saxon, two of his old Columbia University cronies. 
But so what? We got plenty of practice among ourselves, not to 
mention competition from at least another 20 masters capable of 
beating any of us on a given day. 
With this bursting treasury of talent, it is no wonder that the 
United States won four Olympiads during the 1930s. Also, it is no 
wonder that membership in the Manhattan Chess Club was much 
desired. 
Glitterati and Literati 
Aside from the chess stars, the general membership of the old 
Manhattan included many of the glitterati and literati of New Deal 
era New York. In those days great men walked the aisles between 
boards and pondered the fate of pawns. 
Several of this century's finest musicians spent their leisure hours 
shifting wood at the club. Almost all of the great Leopold Auer's 
most famous students were Manhattan members. These included 
Eddie Brown, Mischa Elman, Jascha Heifetz, Leo Kahn, Ivor 
Karman, Max Rosen and Toscha Seidl. Gregor Piatigorsky, the 
world-renowned cellist, was also a member and could occasionally 
be found playing a game with his friend and fellow cellist, Jimmy 
Liebling.

All of the musicians played a pretty strong game. Louis Persinger, 
the violinist who taught Yehudi Menuhin, Ruggiero Ricci and Isaac 
Stern, was strong enough to qualify for the 1944 U.S. Champion­
ship. True, he finished last, but that was because, as he explained it, 
"The boards were out of tune." Here is a hard-fought loss of his 
against world-class violinist and rated master David Oistrakh:

Sinclair Lewis, the author of several Great American Novels, 
showed up now and then. Sorry, I can't recall whether he was a 
Babbitt or a Botvinnik at the board. But I do remember that Morris 
Schapiro, this nation's leading expert on government bonds and 
victor in match play over both Charles Jaffe and Oscar Chajes, 
played risky attacking chess. So, also, did Harold Phillips and Lester 
Samuels, two prominent attorneys. To provide an idea of the 
latter's playing strength, this casual club spieler smashed Herman 
Steiner in a match in 1931 without the loss of a game. 
Still other members included Dr. Albert Pulvermacher, the highly 
regarded German music critic; Dr. Ely Moschkowitz, who along 
with his brother, headed the cardiac department at the world 
famous Mount Sinai Hospital; Arthur Meyer, who gained fame for 
settling numerous New York labor problems as head of the State 
Labor Mediation Board, and his brother Leonard Meyer, who 
headed the long-gone Usona Shirt Company and who once served as 
president of the Manhattan. On one occasion in January 1938, this 
very strong amateur also took the shirt right off the back of 
Emanuel Lasker:

This game, played at the Manhattan Chess Club, is from a two­
hoard consultation simultaneous. Lasker also faced the team of 
Arnold Denker-Harold Phillips in a match-up that he won. As it 
happens, Leonard Meyer was a notorious assassin of champions. In a 
three-board consultation simultaneous at the Manhattan Chess Club 
In March 1929, he teamed with Lester Samuels (once again, as

From the world of high finance came the likes of Howard Hoit of 
the Wall Street firm of Hoit, Rose & Troster. During the Great 
Depression, Howard gave employment to many of our top players. 
He was also an enthusiast of the Kingside attack who could beat 
anyone on a good night.

Howard was typical of many of the old Manhattanites. Relatively 
unschooled in the opening, he relied on raw tactical talent to topple

Another Manhattan chess angel was Maurice Wertheim, banker 
and philanthropist extraordinaire, who served on the War Produc­
tion Board during World War II as a dollar-a-year man. Investment 
bankers Jacques Coe, Sidney Kenton and Richard Warburg were 
also members-as was J. Lessing Rosenwald, chess patron and 
sponsor of the famous Rosenwald tournaments of the 1950s and 
1960s. These competitions served as the U.S. championships of 
those years. 
Four additional luminaries were James Newman, a lawyer, 
author, mathematician and armaments specialist, who went to 
Washington in the 1940s to assist in the war effort; E. Schuyler 
Jackson, a rich amateur who played tournament chess for about 60 
years; and the brothers Robert and Rudolph Raubitschek who hit 
pay dirt in real estate. 
No roster of great Manhattanites would be complete without 
mentioning Henry Atlas, an immigrant from Hungary, who really 
was kinder and gentler and who never failed to help struggling chess 
players seeking him out at his cotton emporium. And how many 
readers remember Felix Kahn of the famous steel family? In a fit of 
depression after losing a fortune in the Great Crash, Felix jumped 
from his penthouse at the Majestic Apartments, though not before 
treating his fellow club members to a great farewell party the 
previous night. Felix was ever a gent of the beau geste.

Tea Drinkers, Knee Slappers 
Introduction

The Manhattan Chess Club was not merely an intellectual oasis for 
the rich and famous; it was also a great joint for meeting odd 
characters. Tea drinkers, knee slappers, Vichy water quaffers, 
nonagenarian kibitzers, amiable "customers"-the place was filled 
with fascinating people ranging from the chablis and brie set to the 
rib and bib bunch to the down and out crowd. 
Once I was paired against the master, Alex Simchow, a chain tea 
drinker. Now, that in itself would not have been so bad. But every 
time he took a sip, up went his glasses to the top of his head and 
down went his fingers into a box of sugar cubes, which he placed 
between his teeth so that the tea would sluice through the sugar on 
the way to his stomach. After each gulp would come a very soft, 
satisfied "aah-ah." It took all of my will power to keep my eyes off 
this beautifully coordinated operation, which Alex had down to a 
"T. "  
Another piece of good luck was to match wits against a knee 
slapper, always an interesting breed of chess player. 
Arthur 
Lamport, a successful banker, came to the club nearly every 
afternoon. A most charming man, he sported perfectly coiffed white 
curls on both sides of a well-oiled scalp. Although Arthur received 
Knight odds, he was, as the saying goes, a "good customer," since he 
invariably lost at 25 cents a game. 
Lamport was, however, a tough fighter, and in his excitement at 
trying to win, he would start slapping his ample thighs with his 
carefully manicured hands. Slapa-slapa-slapa-slapa-slapa-his hands 
and thighs would 
soon be reverberating like a riveting gun 
throughout the club. When one of the members approached, Arthur 
invariably stopped and said, "I know, 
I know!", before the 
complainant could utter a word. Fifteen minutes later, the slapa­
slapa-slapa-slapa-slapa would start all over again. 
Howard Chandler, another outstanding customer, did not use his 
knee as a pogo stick. This sophisticated man was addicted to Vichy 
water. He usually came to the club with at least two quarts of the 
liquid. We played even up for quarters, though I could easily have 
given him odds. After finishing off a bottle of Vichy, he would let 
loose with tremendous pear-shaped burps that could have been 
heard across Yankee Stadium. Following each burp, he smiled and 
winked at me as if we were sharing some secret. Years later, he 
confided that Vichy quaffing was his remedy for a weekend of 
overindulgence. 
Any director casting a movie about the Gold Rush of '49 could 
have used Old Man Zeckendorf, the Manhattan's nonagenarian

10 
The Bobf:>y Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
kibitzer and p,troud member of the Grand Lodge of the State of New 
York. Having, once won a chess game from Confederate General 
James Longstreet, this crusty sourdough from the Southwest was a 
huge man wiшh a head of tousled white hair and plenty of nose and 
chin. His ma,:ssive shoulders were stooped, but only slightly and 
certainly not badly for a man of 90-plus. 
Louis Zeckendorfs main ambition was to live to 100, which he 
failed to fulfill by less than one month, dying in March 1937. He 
seldom played. His great joy was to bet a quarter on me, sit quietly 
at the side of the playing table, his huge hands folded over a cane, 
and watch thoughtfully as the game progressed. When my opponent 
was about to lose, this Civil War veteran would let out a whoop of 
delight by announcing, "Busted!", while simultaneously holding out 
a hand to collect. Of course, he was none too pleased when I lost. 
In all the years that Old Man Z. came to the club, I never heard 
him say anything except "Busted! "  Which leads me to wonder if 
that's what he said when his valet and chauffeur made off with his 
bond coupons. 
And while on the subject of getting busted, I am reminded of the 
handsome Swede, Buster Horneman, who made a mint in export 
and import. This amiable amateur would have gladly sold his soul 
to win just one Rook odds game against Isaac Kashdan. At $10 a 
game, this mania must have cost him thousands, but he never quit 
trying. Here is one of their immortal contests in which White 
removes his Queen Rook.

Men of the Manhattan

Chapter I 
filbert Pinkus: 
'Ihe IndianaJones of Chess 
A second later, I was up in panic, heart pounding, eyes 
staring fearfully into the blackness around. Something was in 
the hammock with me: some "thing" that crawled. A snake! 
What else of that size crawled? Any second I expected the 
strike-it was as if I could feel the creeping numbness, the 
pain and writhings. I waited, tormented by a frantic mind 
feeding on its own fears. But nothing happened, and painful 
seconds lengthened to the pro'Verbial minute of eternity. 
And yet it waited. Why? Was it all really a dream? Just a 
tenderfoot's nightmare? Maybe I had imbibed too freely of 
jungle-book mystery and stealthy blackness. I became bolder. 
My hand stole cautiously to the tickling spot, inch by inch. But 
halfway to its objecti'Ve, it paused. Strained neroes resisted 
further progress, and its newfound daring withered under 
the logic of possibility. There was just a chance, an outside 
chance, that something was there .... 
-A Lost World Beckons by Albert Pinkus and Milton Pauley 
Albert Pinkus-young American Tal of the 1920s, powerful kingpin 
of both the Manhattan and Marshall chess clubs, eventual owner of 
the seventh best won-lost record in U.S. Championship history, 
intrepid jungle explorer better remembered at New York's Museum 
of Natural History than by the chess world, and the man whom I 
call the Indiana Jones of Chess-was spending his first night in the 
jungles of British Guiana. 
The year was 1932. And AI was out to win fame and glory in the 
darkest regions of South America-in places with lazy, muddy rivers 
and ill-shaven soldiers of fortune who wear white suits and Panama 
hats, and who travel on tramp steamers into desolate green hells. 
Al's mission was to Bring 'Em Back Ali'Ve, as in the title of Frank 
Buck's hit movie of the same year. The "'Em" were rare plants and 
animals for museums, botanical gardens, zoos and the private 
15

16 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
collections of men with the means to pay. 
Short, serious and soft-spoken, AI was not a head-turner. His 
dark, broad and flat Slavic face was as square as a block of granite 
and looked a lot like the map of current Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia. Most people probably mistook Al for a conservative, 
buttoned-down businessman with a penchant for three-piece pin­
stripes. Any movie director seeking someone to play a shoe sales­
man would have cast Al on the spot. 
But I knew better. Al was not an accidental tourist in the tropics 
but a man in whom celestial fire burned. Its flames shot up in his 
eyes and glinted off his wide, toothy smile. Possessed of what a New 
York Times reporter termed "a quick, sure manner of speech," Al 
was described in Raymond Ditmars and William Bridges' Snake­
Hunters' Holiday (1935) as a "solidly built young fellow, muscled 
like a prizefighter and a demon of energy." 
That got it just right. 
Boy with a Butterfly Net 
Born March 20, 1903, AI Pinkus grew up in a small, third-floor 
walk-up on West 82nd between Amsterdam and Broadway. A tough 
neighborhood in those days! Al and his brother Milton found that 
the price for being budding Tom Swifts interested in chemistry, 
ham radios and natural science was having to defend themselves 
against neighborhood toughs. 
"I endured the special attention of gangs of hoodlums who 
fancied any boy with a butterfly net delicious bait," Al wrote in the 
autobiographical A Lost World Beckons. "We fought with fists, 
fairly, no chains, clubs, or belts. Never was there two or three 
against one, and pairings usually gravitated to contenders of equal 
age and weight. In all justice, our opponents were 'rough gentle­
men,' though greedy for our subservience." 
Al became an Eagle Scout in 1917, and his early interest in 
natural science blossomed into deep study. He compiled a notable 
butterfly collection and was featured in a two-page spread in the old 
New York World. "My mecca," he wrote, "was the Museum of 
Natural History, a few convenient blocks from home; the curators 
there were my heroes. They spun tales of exciting incidents in 
strange lands with the enviable ease of those who have seen all-my 
impressionable eyes widening with wonder." 
"Eyes widening with wonder"-that was the man I knew.

Like a Mike Tyson Uppercut 
Chapter I 
17 
On April 27, 1924, the young and unknown Pinkus sat down to 
play against Alexander Alekhine in a 26-board blindfold simul­
taneous. The exhibition, a record-breaking affair, was held shortly 
following the famous New York International, and AI won his game 
from the great man as did another unknown, Isaac Kashdan. 
The following year, AI came into his own. Indeed, he hit the New 
York chess scene like a Mike Tyson uppercut. Not only did he 
sacrifice chess pieces like the young Tal, he won every tournament 
in sight. From 1925 to 1928, Pinkus outpaced all of the peers in his 
age group, including Kashdan, AI Horowitz, 
Sammy Reshevsky, 
Tony Santasiere and Herman Steiner. 
Consider Al's record. In October 1925, he won one of Eddie 
Dimock's theme tournaments, a particularly strong event played to 
test the M0ller Attack in the Giuoco Piano. He finished ahead of 
Frank Marshall, Carlos Torre, Santasiere and Steiner. In December 
came the Albert Hallgarten Tournament in which he scored 91/2-21f2 
to outstrip Kashdan and Steiner. In early 1926, he tallied 41f2-1 lf2 to 
tie with Marshall for top spot in another Dimock event, winning 
several Wing Gambits in scorching style.

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
A1 became champion of the Marshall Chess Club in 1927, a 
success that he followed by winning the prestigious Young Masters' 
Tournament of the same year. He scored 7-3 to finish in front of 
Kashdan, Santasiere, Erling Tholfsen and other comers. 
After which . . .  nothing. Tournament appearances became scarce, 
and in early 1928, A1 tallied an inexplicable 0-6 in a double-round 
quad in New York. He would not play seriously again until 1939 ! 
Here is a power game from his first life in chess, for which he 
received the Best Game Prize:

Street Smarts 
A1 left chess for a new game, the dizzying lunacy of 1920s Wall 
Street. Hired by Howard Hoit, a strong club player who was 
chairman of Hoit, Rose & Troster, A1 quickly became the firm's 
youngest junior partner and, according to A1 Horowitz, made 
.860,000 in 1929. In today's debased dollars, that translates to a 
cool half mil or more. Not bad-and better than the likes of 
Kashdan and Horowitz, who worked at the same company. Pinkus 
had what the boys called "Street smarts." 
But then came Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929, a disaster

Chapter I 
19 
described by John Kenneth Galbraith in The Great Crash as not 
only "the most devastating day in the history of the New York stock 
market," but also as "the most devastating day in the history of 
markets." Share values of some issues plunged from $60 to three 
dollars-just like that. Brokers with margin calls sticking out of 
their suit pockets were fished from the Hudson River and quite 
literally scraped off Wall Street, which became known as "Wailing 
Wall Street." 
AI got caught up in the horror. As a junior partner, he had to 
help make good the firm's losses, which left him broke and deeply 
depressed. For the first and probably last time, chess masters 
employed at the stock market went back to chess in order to make 
11 living. "I returned to chess," AI Horowitz once said about leaving 
the exchange in 1932, "on the theory that I could win a quarter a 
Ƶarne and that a quarter could buy a meal." 
As for Pinkus, he took a vacation to British Guiana in early 1932, 
ostensibly to catch butterflies for New York's Museum of Natural 
History, but in truth to escape from Wall Street. When the butterfly 
dodge fizzled, he stayed on to form a business partnership with one 
J>lantagenet Lechmere Guppy, who was the son of the man for 
whom tiny minnows are named. P.L., as he was called, ran an outfit 
that supplied rare and expensive fish to the highly successful Empire 
Tropical Fish Import Company in New York City. 
Wrote AI, "What did I know about catching tropical fish? Noth­
Ing! But with my pocketbook skinny and my eyes peeled for pay­
the-way adventures, I jumped at the chance to become Guppy's 
partner. Seemingly, fish fanciers had taken the bait and were glad to 
be hooked, even for fancy prices, and so I agreed to 'bring 'em back 
alive'-delivery, price, and payment in New York City." AI also 
contracted to provide snakes and lizards to the Bronx Zoo. 
Thus did AI's career as a scientific soldier of fortune begin-and 
his life as a chess master nearly end. Over the next eight years, Al 
played in one or two Metropolitan League matches, competed in a 
couple of Manhattan Chess Club championships and, according to 
the British Chess Magazine, conducted a simultaneous exhibition 
at the Royal Victoria Institute in Trinidad. That's all. 
One of AI's last games from his first career in chess was the 
following win over Aiekhine from a nine-board clock exhibition in 
which the world champion scored an extraordinary +6 -1 =2 
against several of this country's top masters:

Danger Was Al's Business 
In his standoff with the "thing" that was no longer moving, AI 
Pinkus had become immobilized by fear. Sweat rolled from his face, 
and he labored at breathing air thicker and wetter than any he had 
known before. 
"Whereupon," wrote Pinkus, "something long and quivery slid 
across my bare ankle. I jumped, my tensed body a released spring, 
hitting the wooden floor with a most-painful jar. Madly, I flung off 
the tangle of netting and raced blindly for the door; instead, my 
shoulder struck brutally against a wall, sending me sprawling 
backward to the floor. Groggily, I rose and fled in the opposite 
direction until my knee stabbed suddenly into something hard and 
sharp-the pain excruciating! I groped in agony for the aching joint, 
but instead found the trunk that I hazily recalled was near the door, 
and I flew straight ahead through a gray-black opening . .  .into the 
arms of a man, knocking him down." 
The man, Al's host, was a local missionary named Archer, who 
then helped our hero search for the "thing," which turned out to be 
a foot-long black centipede. 
"As it scurried on a thousand 
synchronized legs for the safety of some dark niche," AI wrote of 
the deadly insect, "I took aim and threw a shoe, luckily hitting the 
mark, the 'thing's' remains spattering in a quivering, loathsome 
muddle of blood and legs." 
Danger was Al's business. It was a business that included a 
midnight battle on a jungle trail against the red-eyed, lethal fer-de­
lance; several hours up a Mora tree as hostage from a phalanx of

Chapter I 
21 
angry wild pigs just a few feet below; and even a stint as a "general" 
directing members of one of his expeditions in a desperate battle 
against Brazilian bandits. About which, more anon. 
Of course, there were lighter moments-such as the time that AI 
arrived in New York with a vast collection of animals for the Saint 
Louis and Bronx zoos, but found himself left with an extra giant 
anteater and two 20-foot anacondas. AI never tired of telling how he 
inveigled a taxi driver to deliver both him and the tropical animals 
to his mother's home, where he hid the creatures in her warm cellar. 
And while on the topic of animals, AI would return every year 
from the jungles and regale us with hilarious tales about Boswell, a 
pet monkey that followed him everywhere. My wife Nina was 
charmed by the stories, and during a car trip up north to play in the 
1939 New York State Championship, AI promised to bring us back a 
monkey from his next journey. 
We chess players know that the threat is often worse than the 
execution, and for months, I worried that he might actually keep 
the promise. 
Into "The Lost World" 
On September 6, 1938, AI left Georgetown, British Guiana, on the 
trip of his life, a six-month expedition to Mount Roraima. Located 
along the borders of Venezuela, Brazil and British Guiana, this 
nearly inaccessible peak was made famous by Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle in The Lost World and by Hollywood in countless movies as 
the home of 65-foot brontosauruses and other beasts a Ia Jurassic 
Park. In reality, the 9,100-foot, red-sandstone table mountain with 
its 25-square mile plateau contains a power far mightier than a 
thousand prehistoric monsters, for it is the source of the Amazon, 
Essequibo and Orinoco rivers. 
AI was leader and sole financial backer of a 200-man force, which 
was called the "Pinkus-Peberdy Expedition into the Lost World" 
(Paul S. Peberdy was the curator of the British Guiana Museum). 
Al's goal in this, his lOth and final foray for flora and fauna, was to 
become only the 13th white man to scale Mt. Roraima. For six 
months, as the New York Times put it, he "hacked his way through 
brush and swamp to collect rare specimens of birds and animals." 
Picking off birds was a specialty of the aborigines. "Experts with 
bamboo blow-pipes," wrote the Times, "the natives would creep 
within 10 feet of a sitting bird and with a short, noiseless puff lodge 
a dart in its breast." AI, too, became adept with a blow-pipe, though 
I don't recall my friend ever skewering a sitting chess opponent.

22 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Conditions on the trek were tough. An exjpedition member 
moaned, "Nowhere else have I ever seen published: an official report 
of the temperature in the sun, but yesterday it waно 156 degrees." As 
for food, Al loved the "particularly fine meat" of the Laba. "It is a 
rodent," he wrote, "perhaps the world's largest rat; as big as a small 
pig. There is a saying that if you eat Laba and drink swamp water, 
then you will always return to British Guiana." 
Or never leave it. 
In an old letter on yellowing, parchment-like paper, Al described 
his Christmas dinner of 1938 in The Lost World. "It consisted," Al 
scratched in his small, pinched script, "of Breast of. Marudi and Wild 
Pigeon, cooked in casserate (a dark brown sauce made from the 
poisonous juice of the cassava), raw fried potatoes, .rice yams, gravy, 
N.Y. coffee, yellow crystal sugar and grapefruit." Al further noted 
that the food was "seasoned" by· d_roppinп, frorn diving· vampire

On November 16, after 1() weeks., of collecting рples, the

The expedition to The Lost . World mad¢. it back to. this world­

Daily Argosy, "numbers over· 710QO spec;i,uJ;ens· of· birds, plants, 
insects, fishes, reptiles, batrachians arid land and fresh water 
mollusca." From this huge collection, Al sent some 700 birds to the 
University of Michigan and about 300 rare or new flower species (a 
total of 3,000 specimens) to New York's Botanical Gardens. Hun­
dreds of the more marketable monkeys, sloths, snakes and so on 
were sold to animal dealers. 
After eight years spent slogging through steaming jungles, Al had 
finally scaled the heights of a profession that he called "scientific 
adventure." One of his discoveries, a hitherto unknown rubber tree, 
was named Vochysia pinkusii. A nearly transparent fish with red 
eyes that Al found in an isolated mountain pool was dubbed the 
Pinkusis by curators at the Museum of Natural History. 
But before all of this fame and glory came a . . .

Firefight at Night 
Chapter I 
23 
Having assembled thousands of the above-mentioned specimens, Al 
needed to pack them back to civilization. Leaving Mt. Roraima on 
January 22, he set out at the head of a line of march that stretched 
for miles. 
"Not surprisingly," Al wrote of the six-weйlk, 350-mile return 
journey to Georgetown, "our pace quickened once the expedition's 
feet were pointed homeward. We were already imagining the 
acclaim of a breathless, waiting world. 
Indeed, had we not 
conquered Roraima and left evidence-names and dates of our visit 
In a stone-protected bottled cache on its peak? We were travelling 
an easy downhill course, from approximately 9,000 to 2,000 feet. 
"But I resisted being caught up in the euphoria. Why? Because 
we were being followed! ! " 
The attack on Al's group came three hours before dawn. Thanks 
to an agreement signed in advance by the major members of the 
expedition, Al was the unquestioned leader. His orders were law, 
and he now worked out a strategy worthy of any general. 
"About 3 a.m.," he wrote, "we heard ominous noises: shrill 
whistling warnings first from our alert Acawoio Indian scouts, then 
three quick shots in rapid succession. We jumped up like released 
springs, weapons of all kinds cocked. 
"Everyone glanced in my direction, and I made a quick decision. 
Rounding up all but a handful of men, I gambled on a frontal 
attack, not crediting the enemy with a deceptive flanking maneuver; 
but just in case, I left behind Peberdy and a handful of braves as 
reserves. 
"Quickly instructing my braves to shout at the top of their lungs 
and to shoot into the air, 25 of us streaked forward shouting like 
banshees. But we encountered only the sound of barely audible 
retreating feet. I yelled 'Back, back,' pointing toward camp, still 
concerned about the maneuver being a diversion. I had some 
difficulty with the more impetuous youngsters. However, they soon 
saw my reasoning-that it was not cowardice-and followed the 
orders. 
"At camp, our reserves came out of their strategic hiding spots 
with disappointed faces showing in the wet, gray-streaked dawn." 
New Zion in the Tropics 
Shortly after returning from The Lost World, Al became involved 
through brother Milton in a little-known American effort to create a

24 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
haven for fleeing кEuropean Jews in the wilderness of British Guiana. 
In response to a British offer to donate 42,000 square miles of 
largely unexplored territory, President Franklin Roosevelt estab­
lished the British Guiana Commission to the Advisory Committee 
on Political Refugees. The Commission, using funds provided by 
Anthony de Rothschild, was to conduct feasibility studies for what I 
call a New Zion in the Tropics. 
At this point, enter Al. The Commission needed to address in 
detail the suitability of the proffered territory for European 
settlement, which meant studying the agriculture, natural resources, 
transportation and climate of the area. As an Old Guiana Hand, Al 
was contacted by Dr. Joseph Rosen, the Commission's agricultural 
expert. "We have had many friendly talks," Al wrote to his brother 
on April 6, 1939. "Unofficially, I'm sure the Jews are coming here, 
but Rosen can tell you more about it. He says that he feels too old 
now to do the field work, so I guess he will give way to younger 
men. The plan will be to settle experimental groups (500-1,000) in 
various places and let them explore the country for the best sites." 
Continued Al, "I am seeing many pitiful sights of Jews going 
down to French Guiana from here. So far, 14 have come thru, but 
I'm afraid the plan is a failure. The men are working on a sugar 
estate for 15 francs a day ( 45 cents) which hardly can pay for food, 
and the place is malarial, so in case of sickness they are goners. We 
have been helping out some refugees who come here. One former 
diamond polisher got an overseer's job on an estate. Salary, $33 a 
month and all expenses paid. I don't think I ever saw a happier man 
after we got him the job." 
In May 1939, the Commission submitted its report, which 
concluded that the territory "undoubtedly possesses potential 
possibilities that would fully justify the carrying out of a trial 
settlement project on a substantial. . .scale." But the start of World 
War II four months later ended Jewish emigration from Europe. 
His Second Career in Chess 
By July 1939, Al was in New York selling off his huge collection of 
flora and fauna. Celebrated in the New York Times as the "Ex­
Broker Back from Exploring Conan Doyle's 'Lost World"' and 
touted in several newspapers as "that one man in a million who is 
doing just what he wants to do," Al planned a new, still more 
ambitious expedition. "In September," Al told a Times reporter, " I  
set out for a completely uncharted territory in Central British 
Guiana. I'm going straight to the Merema Mountain range, and I 
hope to find even rarer birds and beasts than any I've found so far."

Chapter I 
25 
Al never made it. His plans, like the hopes for New Zion, were 
demolished when Hitler's artillery began pounding Poland on 
September 1, 1939. In 1940 Al married the former Sereta Tessler, 
and during World War II, he worked for Lummis, Inc. as a bridge 
draftsman. In 1945 he returned to Wall Street as a trader of 
Insurance stocks. 
Al launched his second career in chess at the 1939 U.S. Open, 
where in the words of Chess Review, he "made an auspicious re­
entry into top-flight tourney play after an absence of many years." 
J?inishing fourth, he came close to upsetting Reshevsky.

Further successes followed. Most notably, AI scored very well in 
four U.S. championships, finishing 4th-5th in 1940, 3rd-4th in 
1942, fifth in 1944 and eighth in 1946. His overall record of +35 
-16 =26 is the seventh best in U.S. Championship history. Other 
successes included winning the Manhattan Chess Club champion­
ships of 1941 and 1945. In the latter event, he scored 10-2 to finish 
ahead of both Kashdan and myself. In August 1946, he won a strong 
training tournament with a field that included several members of a 
U.S. national team that met a Soviet squad the following month. 
"Le Style est L'Homme Meme" 
Never was Georges Buffon's insight that "the style is the man" more 
true than in the case of A1 Pinkus. As a young man, my friend was 
distinguished by fast speech and unbridled confidence, just as in 
turn he distinguished himself by derring-do as a stock trader and 
attacking master. In middle-age, he mellowed noticeably and signed 
a peace treaty with his earlier ambition, just as in turn this family 
man began to perform solidly rather than brilliantly as a stock 
trader and positional master. 
For a long time, I blamed the hard winds of life for the apparent 
dimming of Al's candle-a conventional and probably shallow expla­
nation. You see, AI was by nature and design a Great White Hunter, 
who was a fish out of water when selling securities and playing chess 
spare-time in New York. If in the jungle, as AI wrote, "strict adher­
ence to a credo that leaves nothing to chance, unless very calcu­
lated" means "staying alive," then the requirements of competition 
in civil society or over the chess board are far different. Paradoxi­
cally, bold adventurers battling nature must exercise supreme cau­
tion, while businessmen and chess masters battling the competition 
must speculate if they are to accumulate. 
What saved AI from becoming a chess drone was that along with 
caution, he also brought to our art a scientist's passion for truth. A 
session of chess analysis can reveal a lot about a person's character 
because all pretense is cast aside; and AI, like the philosophers of 
old who poked through history in futile attempts to explain it, 
analyzed his beloved Ruy Lopez and other openings to reach firmly 
grounded conclusions, not to score points. I will never forget the 
little smile that always lit up his face when after digging deeper and 
deeper into a position, he finally hit paydirt. 
During the 1940s, AI and I became good friends-and rivals. I 
soon discovered that the outcome of a given game, no matter how 
important, meant less to him than holding the game up to the light 
and turning it this way and that during the post-mortem. Take, for 
example, our game in the 1946 Manhattan Chess Club Champion-

ship, which deprived him of the title and garnered me the brilliancy 
prize. 
On my lOth move, I offered a pawn for no immediate advantage 
other than rapid development and control of the board. Many 
masters would have passed on the pawn. But not AI the Scientist, 
who cheerfully entered into my proposed experiment. After he 
moved, I noticed that he wrote something on his score sheet. When 
he left the table, I leaned over to read two words typical of Pinkus: 
"Show me." I made my next couple of moves, picked up his score 
sheet and added the words: "Don't worry, I will." We were like two 
scientists politely disagreeing about the merits of a new discovery.

laboratory than in a chess game played under a time limit, here is 
a superb rapid transit effort in which he batters me brilliantly:

If Al's determination to follow the truth occasionally hindered 
him in over-the-board competition, he could still topple the mighty. 
At his best, AI played with the disciplined vigor of Bobby Fischer, 
essaying well-prepared openings and evaluating an advantage with 
straightforward positional maneuvers and tactics. Many of his wins 
were model games, and to plagiarize Irving Chernev, he was often 
"the life of the partie":

picks up both pawns and wins easily. 
Old-Fashioned Sense of the Fitting 
If someone were to ask me what set AI apart from other men I 
knew, I would cite a trait that remained unchanged throughout his 
life: An old-fashioned sense of the fitting. I'm not talking about his 
even-tempered behavior or his invariable grace in defeat. Not at all. 
I'm talking about his practice of precisely tailoring personal conduct 
to fit the demands of a situation. 
Typical of the man was a little incident near the end of a speed 
tournament at the Marshall Chess Club in which AI did very well. 
His son Larry remembers wanting to hang around to savor his 
father's success and to milk the glorious day for still more fun. But 
AI said quietly, "Larry, we had our fun, so let's go home"-an 
example of voluntary self-restraint, a quality on this society's 
endangered species list. You see, AI knew that a person can get too 
much of a good thing. Even too much fun. Perhaps that's why I 
never met anyone who derived more genuine enjoyment from the 
fun that he did have. "Mirthful" is a word not often used these days, 
but it perfectly describes Al's laugh. 
Al's great joy and gentleman's obsession was to remove the 
bindings from rare tournament books and rebind them with the 
most beautiful gilt covers to be found outside of a medieval 
monastery. Trips to his home were a treat because we always got 
around to examining the books and opening them to play over 
some classic games. The last time I visited him, he had already 
bound hundreds of books which formed one of the finest libraries in 
the world. 
In today's market this collection would be priceless, and I often 
wonder what happened to it. 
His Final Years 
During the 1950s, AI continued to play in Manhattan Chess Club 
championships, though these appearances became less frequent. His 
final year in chess, so far as I have been able to determine, was 
1973, when he competed in the World Open. Here is a game he won 
in the Greater New York Open of that year.

On February 4, 1984, Al Pinkus died from Alzheimer's Disease at 
Wyckoff Heights Hospital in Brooklyn. His son Larry says that the 
disease ground him down inexorably and that he eventually had 
difficulty remembering to punch his chess clock after moving. 
That's hard to believe about my friend-the young "demon of 
c.:nergy" who was "muscled like a prizefighter." Yet I must believe it. 
For so many of the great men of chess I once admired and even 
loved-Alexander Alekhine, Edward Lasker, dear sweet Oscar 
Tenner-are gone. 
And time, that relentless enemy of remembrance, insatiably 
drains tangibility from their memory. In the Biblical phrase, the 
places that knew them shall know them no more; and they, who 
once seemed so alive and distinct, grow distant and become blurred 
In the mind's eye like figures stepping backwards into a mist.

larger sense, young Winston's losing move was 4. N-NS. Pinkus was, after all, 
one of the all-time leading authorities on the Two Knights Defense. He 
published several articles on the opening in Chess Review, and Soviet players 
used his largely uncredited analyses to rewrite important chapters on Two 
Knights theory. His master-level opponent in this game later wrote to Pinkus, 
"Apparently, you are still somewhat ahead of the latest theory on the Two 
Knights."

Chapter I I  
(j)eath cBe not cproud

If I were to tell you that a young man's father was an alcoholic who 
late one night walked off a pier and drowned and that his 
uneducated mother scrubbed floors and cleaned offices to pay the 
rent for an ugly little flat in Hell's Kitchen, what would you rate 
that man's chances in our society? 
Right, but as a rare flower may flourish in the desert, so genius 
sometimes seems to grow in the most barren of soils. For such was 
the background of Donald MacMurray, the greatest genius whom I 
ever knew and the possessor of the highest I.Q. recorded in America 
up to the time of the early 1930s. To this day-50-plus years 
later-no one has equalled his record of earning a Bachelor of Arts 
degree at the University of Chicago and a law degree at prestigious 
Columbia. Oh, yes, he completed the first degree in 8% months and 
the second in a single year! 
Donald and I met in our early teens under most unusual circum­
stances; and that we would later become close friends after a rocky 
start was even more remarkable. Mac was captain of the De Witt 
Clinton High School chess team, while I served as captain of 
Theodore Roosevelt. Both of us were finalists in the New York City 
Individual Championship, and as luck would have it, our game 
decided the winner. As White, I was up a piece in a winning position 
when he played . . .  P-KN4, attacking my Knight on KB4. As I 
reached to move the Knight, I inadvertently knocked over my King 
on KNl. Whereupon, Mac explained to referee Hermann Helms that 
my lapse could only mean that I was resigning or that I planned to 
move my King. But the ref, who was known as the Grand Old Man 
of American Chess, ruled in my favor at once. And Mac resigned. 
Later, as we left the Marshall Chess Club together, he explained 
that even this last variation had not been good enough, though he 
felt it had been worth a try. As the years passed, we met many 
times at the Manhattan Chess Club where we were junior members. 
We played a lot of chess together and even teamed up with two

others to hold Alexander Alekhine to a draw in the world cham­
pion's famous simultaneous exhibition on election day, November 
8, 1932, at the old Seventh Regiment Armory. The game and an 
account of the exhibition appear elsewhere in the chapter on 
Alekhine. 
Mac also played another chess immortal, Jose Capablanca, who 
conducted an exhibition along the same lines as Alekhine's a year 
earlier at the Armory. The great Cuban seemed to start out well in 
the game, but Mac and a young Reuben Fine showed some fine 
endgame technique. Defeating Capablanca was always a notable 
feat.

Yidel mit dem Fiedel 
Mac and I soon became inseparable; we went all over together. 
Harrison Weil, one of the wags at the Manhattan, took to calling us 
"the Gold Dust Twins." Certainly, my close proximity to a genius 
had a positive influence on my education. Thanks to "Meckele," as 
Donald liked to be called, I learned many Yiddishisms which later 
came in handy. Mac was such an expert in the language that many 
took it for granted that he was an Irish Jew. But it was not the case. 
He used to frequent the Yiddish Theater and learned many Yiddish 
songs by heart. Once he won a five-dollar bet by proving that he 
could sing Yidel mit dem Fiedel without any coaching. Mac was so 
poor that he doubtlessly needed the money. 
Imagine, therefore, everyone's surprise when he showed up one 
day at the Manhattan Chess Club looking every bit the part of Lord 
Fauntleroy. It was wintertime, and he was wearing an expensive 
cloth coat with a wide mink collar. His shoes were covered with 
gray spats, and he smoked a cigarette through a long holder. The 
whole routine was so unlike him that it created quite a stir until he

38 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
explained that he had been legally adopted by the Hollingworths. 
Professor Harry Hollingworth was chairman of the Psychology 
Department at Columbia University, and his wife, Leta, held the 
same rank at Barnard. For them, Donald was a living experiment 
about which they would later write in their book, You and 
Heredity. From that day forward, I mostly called him "Pooritzl," 
which meant "little prince" in the Yiddish that he taught me. 
The Best Years of His Life 
From the autumn of 1935 to the summer of 1936, the brief period 
during which Mac completed his schooling at the University of 
Chicago, I got to see him only on vacations. Then, in June 1936, he 
came home and married the lovely Evelyn Ehrlich, his childhood 
sweetheart from the renowned Special Opportunity Class for gifted 
children at old P.S. 165 up on West 108th and Broadway. 
The mid-1930s were the best and happiest years of Mac's life, 
though some rather worrying bouts of nausea struck him on 
occasion. But they passed. And, after all, he was getting offers for 
his services from all over and being celebrated in New York Times 
headlines as the young genius who "established a new record for 
speed in obtaining [his] degree." He also took pride in moving his 
mother, Florence, out of Hell's Kitchen into decent digs at, if 
memory serves, 219 East 26th Street. The oyster of life appeared to 
be brimming with pearls. 
By then I, too, had gotten married, and the four of us enjoyed 
some great times together. Mac had a marvelous sense of humor, 
and he could turn the most mundane activity into a memorable 
experience through the power of wit and imagination. What a great 
television evangelist he would have made. He could get people to do 
almost anything, and what's more they did not resent doing it. One 
evening he wanted to go dancing or "stompin'," as we used to say, 
at the Savoy Ballroom on Lenox Avenue up in Harlem. We were five 
couples, and only Mac was even slightly interested in such an 
expedition. Yet he convinced one and all that this would be a most 
unusual experience to be treasured for the rest of our lives. 
And so it was: We all went, and we all had a great time. 
Of course, doing anything with Mac was a delight. He had a rare 
gift for seeing things from oblique angles-a facility that extended 
to his original chess style. In the mid-1930s, he scored respectably 
in several Manhattan club championships, which were at that time 
stronger than many international tournaments. Among his victims 
were Isaac Kashdan, this writer (who also played a drawn match 
with him) and most of the other top American players. At the 193 7

Chapter II 
39 
U.S. Open in Chicago, he shared third-fourth with George Treys­
man. Then, at the 1938 U.S. Open held during a sizzling July in 
Boston, Mac scored an equally hot lOlf2-lf2 in what was called the 
Consolation Masters' section. In the prelims, he played a couple of 
bad games and failed to qualify for the Masters' Final. But take a 
look at the havoc he created once he woke up. According to Harry 
Lyman, a master from Boston, Mac "set the room on fire" with this 
wonderfully baroque brilliancy against Weaver Adams:

The Summer of "38 
In August of Mac's final summer, we went upstate with the wives to 
Cazenovia to play in the New York State Championship, a tourna­
ment that I won. The first evening at dinner Meckele complained of 
his old nausea and of stomach pains when laughing. No one gave it a 
thought until the next day at lunch when he had to leave the table. 
There was so much laughter that he could not control the pain. I 
then asked my good friend, the late Dr. Joseph Platz, who was also 
competing in the tournament, to examine Mac. 
I will never forget what he told me that evening: "He has a cancer 
in his stomach as large as a grapefruit, and in such a young man it is 
the same as tossing a match into a dry wheat field." A little more 
than three months later-on December 2, 1938, shortly following 
Mac's 24th birthday-Dr. Platz's sad prediction came true. 
Mac did not give up on life until the very end. My wife, Nina, 
visited him almost daily at Doctors Hospital in New York City, and I 
also dropped by, though less frequently. To watch him waste away 
and to hear him discuss his bright plans for a destiny denied, was 
too heartbreaking. 
Donald MacMurray never became a grandmaster, but had he 
lived, I am sure that he would have. He never practiced law, but at 
the time of his death, he was considering numerous offers. Like a 
falling star he came to light up our sky for a few moments and then 
to depart. Those of us fortunate enough to have known him came 
away rich in memories.

Oscar 'fenner:fi Character 
if ever 'fhere was One 
The great Oscar Tenner was a fixture at the Manhattan Chess Club 
for close to 30 years. Everyone knew Oscar, and no out-of-towner 
ever left the club without leaving a small deposit for the pleasure of 
crossing swords with him. You won't find Oscar mentioned in The 
Oxford Companion to Chess or other chess encyclopedias, but he 
was a memorable character if ever there was one. 
In the "good old days"-sneer, if you must-when the club was 
at the Alamac Hotel on 71st and Broadway, Oscar arrived early 
each day and sat at "his" table, squinting at Die Stadtszeitung, his 
favorite newspaper. When someone once foolishly asked why he 
lwpt his glasses on his head while reading, he replied, "That way 
they reflect the newsprint better." After one of these "witzen" or 
jokes, he would shake with laughter, displaying a number of missing 
teeth. That prompted Robert Willman, a many-time champion of 
the Manhattan, to call him Skeezix, the famous cartoon child with 
hut two front teeth. 
Oscar was an expert on politics. He analyzed the news daily, and 
there was not an item on foreign affairs that he overlooked while 
waiting for his "customers" to arrive. "Wissen sie" ("Did you know 
that. . .  ") would start every conversation, and then he would launch 
upon a lengthy spiel about the true meaning of the news as he saw 
it. Oscar missed his vocation. Had he been a bit more fluent in 
English, Gabriel Heatter, that great radio commentator of the 1930s 
and 1940s, might have wound up on the Bowery. 
One thing was certain where Oscar was concerned. He feared no 
one. He had supreme confidence, the type that overcomes tragedy 
and performs miracles. Though he had lost to you a hundred times 
in a row, he was sure that he would win the next time. And if the 
game were blitz chess, then his self-assurance had some basis. Oscar 
played a very strong speed game. Take a look some time at the 
tournament table of the rapid transit event during the famous 1924 
New York International. Oscar made it into the final group where he 
43

tied for second, a point behind Jose Capablanca, whom he drew. He 
finished ahead of Geza Maroczy and Savielly Tartakower, both of 
whom he defeated. Here is a sample of Oscar's form when playing 
chess at 10 seconds a move:

game, "The spontaneous sacrifices are sound even under the scru­
tiny of discriminating analysis." 
uvou Get Vun" 
On occasion during the 1930s, when Oscar was short of customers, 
he would join us "terrible Turks" at 10-second chess. These sessions 
had their embarrassing moments because when Oscar lost-and 
being past his prime, he nearly always did-he had no money to 
pay up. He would stick his fingers into his vest pockets, swish them 
around for a moment, and then announce for all to hear, "You get 
vun." No matter how many times he lost, he would always go 
through the same ritual of fumbling through his pockets and 
announcing, "You get vun." Whereupon Willman would snidely ask, 
"Do you have any fish hooks in your pockets?" Someone else might 
have become angry or unpleasant at this type of razzing, but not 
Oscar. He accepted it gracefully and even seemed to enjoy it, which 
was one of the reasons we were all so fond of him. 
I especially remember one warm afternoon back in the summer 
of '39 at the Old Manhattan. Oscar was up two or three pieces 
against a favorite "customer." But this gentleman flouted the chess 
etiquette of offhand games and continued to shift wood with 
excruciating deliberation. The game flowed on and on and on. 
Finally, with his lone king facing a mate in two, the "customer" 
resigned. "Too late! "  Oscar snapped. And drawing himself up with 
astonishing hauteur, he delivered the coup de grace with a snap, 
crackle and pop rarely seen at the board. From that point on, the 
"customer" resigned on time. 
Looking back at Oscar's games, my impression is that he was a 
very talented player. At one time or another, he defeated most of 
the leading American masters, including the likes of Isaac Kashdan 
and AI Horowitz. In his youth, before leaving Germany for America 
in mid-1922, he knocked off such famous European masters as 
Fyodor Bogatyrchuk (a future co-champion of the Soviet Union), 
Karel Hromadka and Karel Treybal. Even in later years he still 
played the opening on a par with the very best. But from there on, 
he would relax his grip and expect the position to play itself. Still, 
as the following theoretically important game demonstrates, he was 
a road hazard even for the very best:

White cannot save his Bishop and defend against the crushing 
threat of 18 . . . .  Q-N5. 
The game is theoretically important because most authorities 
consider White's game as won after 17. B-N4 instead of Maroczy's 
blunder, 
17. B-K7??. This opinion dates back to 
Alexander 
Alekhine's comments in his book on the New York 1927 tourna­
ment-comments which were later ratified by Efim Bogolyubov in 
Die Moderne Eroffnung: 1. d2-d4 and accepted as conventional 
wisdom by Gary Kasparov and Raymond Keene in their Batsford 
Chess Openings. The idea is that after 17. B-N4 PxP 18. R-K1 Q-B3, 
White has the winning line, 19. BxPch NxB 20. R-K8ch N/Q2-B1 2 1 .

BxN NxB 23. Q-K7. The critics have all overlooked 21. . . .  N-N4 ! !  (a

26. P-B4, then Black plays 26 . . . .  Q-B6! ,  threatening mate on KB8. 
White cannot escape the toils by the expedient of 19. P-Q5 (rather 
than 19. BxPch), with the idea of deflecting the Queen from its K1 
square. If 19 . . . .  QxP, White wins easily after 20. BxPch NxB 21. R­
K8ch N/Q2-B1 22. BxN NxB 23. Q-N4. The fly in the ointment is 
22 . . . .  N-B3 ! ,  and White can resign after 23. Q-K1 NxR 24. QxN B­
R6! 25. QxR Q-Q6. 
In his style Oscar belonged to the romantics. He consciously 
strove for beauty over the board, and no Manhattan Chess Club 
Championship seemed complete without his winning a brilliancy 
prize. Unfortunately, he courted complications even in easily won 
positions. As AI Horowitz once wrote in Chess Review, never for 
Oscar safety and sanity when risk and foolhardiness would do. In 
the following game, most masters would have grabbed Black's 
Queen at move 21 rather than toss more wood on the sacrificial fire:

Oscar figured in a strange episode involving Alexander Alekhine. 
In My Best Games of Chess, 1 908-1 923, Alekhine included a IS­
move brilliancy against Oscar that can be found in a note to an 
Alekhine-Teichmann game. Oscar protested and presented convinc­
ing evidence that the game quoted by Alekhine was only a post­
mortem variation from the real contest, which ended in a draw.

Oscar was born on April 5, 1880, in Lvov, then the capital of the 
Austrian-held region of Galicia and now part of Ukraine. His heri­
tage, however, was primarily German, and one can find his name in 
old Berlin tournament crosstables circa 1910. In 1914, Oscar was 
battling for the lead in the second master group or "Hauptturnier 
A" of the Mannheim International when World War I broke out. The 
players in the top master group included Alexander Alekhine, Milan 
Vidmar, Rudolf Spielmann, Richard Reti and others. The Russian 
players were interned at Triberg, and Oscar found himself shuffled 
off with them. He often told the story about how they made a chess 
set out of soft bread and later, when food became scarce, ate the 
pieces. To escape internment, he joined the Austrian army (suffering 
two slight battle wounds), and many was the time that he demon­
strated the infamous goose step during our late-night walks from the 
Manhattan Chess Club down to the Battery.

.. Have You Seen My Little Vun?" 
Chapter III

I will never forget the afternoon of March 18, 1930. Oscar arrived at 
the club flushed with excitement. He had been seeing Edith 
Bernstein, a middle-aged lady from Berlin, and with America's chess 
dean Hermann Helms acting as witness, Oscar had taken the final 
plunge at the Municipal Building that very morning. There were 
congratulations all around, and in the afternoon Edith came to the 
club wearing a white blouse and a simple black suit. She looked so 
radiant, and Oscar was beaming. Later, we all went out for a small 
celebration thrown by real estate tycoon Robert Raubitschek, a 
huge man who resembled a pale, blue-eyed walrus. 
Oscar and Edith made a love nest for themselves down on East 
1 2th; and some months later, to everyone's surprise, Mrs. T. gave 
birth to a son, Marcus. From that day on, Oscar would strut into 
the club, thumbs hooked in his vest pockets and his chest all puffed 
out. He no longer concerned himself with an analysis of the news. 
There was only one burning question on his mind, зnd he asked it 
of all who ventured near enough: "Have you seen my little vun?" 
At age 68, on December 24, 1948, Oscar died in New York's 
Bellevue Hospital. Chess will never see another character quite like 
him.

Albert C .  "Buddy" Simonson burst onto the New York chess scene 
like a meteor and then disappeared almost as quickly. But during 
his short stay, he won many honors as a player, as a problemist and 
as a member of the victorious U.S. team at the 1933 Folkestone 
Olympiad. The high point of his career occurred in 1936, when 
only a final-round defeat prevented him from winning the first 
modern U.S. Championship. After that setback, his interest in chess 
seemed to wane. He did well enough in the 1938 and 1940 champi­
onships, but his comeback attempt in the 1951 fixture ended 
catastrophically, when he shared 10th-12th places. 
Because that final-round loss in the 1936 championship caused 
Buddy to seek other, less wholesome competitive outlets and gen­
erally played a pernicious part in his later life, here is the dreary 
game:

Buddy was a tall, shy young man, ever well-dressed and always 
with hair neatly slicked down. As was said of Marie Antoinette, 
there was something both beautiful and unfortunate about him. He 
seemed like a character out of the pages of Aubrey Beardsley and 
Ƶave the impression of being perpetually on his way to tea at the 
Plaza. Maybe it was the umbrella that he carried on his arm or the 
uut of his clothes. His look smacked of Eton in the 1920s. He was 
so talented and so bright that he could have been successful at 
anything he tackled. Had he pursued a career in chess there is no 
telling how far he would have gone, though the two wins given 
below are suggestive. The first speaks for itself. The second, featur­
Ing a very impressive combination, was played against the man 
whom many felt to be the world's strongest player at the time. As 
for Buddy, it was his first serious game in about a decade.

The normal fate of this move when played by Black is unpleas­
ant. It succeeds here because White has eschewed all action in the 
center.

was so surprising "that even calm, quick-thinking Reshevsky 
becomes perplexed and fails to find the best chances." The only try 
was 18. -PxBP QN-KS 19. NxN NxN 20. BxN B-NS ! (this move is 
better than grabbing the exchange with 20 . . . .  BxR) 21. Q-K3 BxB

Unfortunately, Buddy had a restless nature that caused him to 
flit from one thing to another, and he never quite completed 
nnything. No sooner did he master chess than he became bored and 
went on to something else. First, it was pinochle, then bridge, gin 
rummy, poker, backgammon-all the great competitive games. In 
itself, this compulsion for mental competition was okay because 
Buddy was great at every one of these games. But some mad desire 
made him gamble with only the very best in each field. Of course, 
he would lose; and, unfortunately (there's that word again), he 
remained undaunted. I often claimed that if there had been a 
decathlon of indoor games, he would have been a shoo-in; instead, 
he lived according to the Russian proverb that more good swimmers 
drown than bad ones. 
He Solved Only Chess Problems 
Buddy's parents were very well off even during the Great Depres­
sion. His father was "Simonson" of Simonson's of Fifth Avenue 
(located back then on 36th Street), which sold wigs and toupees to 
the movie industry and to the very wealthy. His mother was an 
lиlgin of timepiece fame. Moreover, when Buddy turned 19 in 1933 , 
he inherited the first $25,000-the equivalent of at least a quarter 
million in today's debased dollars-of many such increments left to 
him by the Grandpas Elgin. Yet so great were Buddy's debts even at 
that tender age, that by the time he paid off his creditors, there was 
little left for himself. Someone else might have been shocked into 
mending his ways. 
Not Buddy. He just sailed along as if nothing had happened. Year 
after year the gambling continued, without his even acknowledging 
a problem, let alone confronting it. Chess problems, he could solve; 
personal problems, no. Once, when loan sharks were threatening to 
break his legs, he sold an interest in a building that he and his sister 
owned jointly. At other times, he sold interests in money due him 
at a future date for about 25 cents on the dollar. 
Prior to my marriage, Buddy and I were very close. We met for 
the first time in 1930 when I was 16, spent much time studying 
chess, and played blindfolded as we walked the streets. He had a

56 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
good sense of humor and laughed easily. But his penchant for 
practical jokes occasionally made enemies. One afternoon, following 
a session of 10-second chess with A1 Horowitz and Robert Willman, 
Buddy offered to buy us lunch at his favorite haunt, the old-world 
Barberry Room. Naturally, we accepted at once. Then, as a seeming 
afterthought, he remembered that he had only $20 with him, so 
that if the bill came to more than that, we would have to pay the 
difference. Since our usual lunch never came to more than 25 cents, 
we never dreamed that there were places which charged two dollars 
for bread and butter alone. And that was about all we ate, along 
with coffee! Al and Willy never forgave him, but in those days, 
everything he did struck me as hilarious. Those were great years for 
both of us, and I still remember fondly some of the silly, though 
interesting things we did after discovering girls. 
Buddy Goes to Work 
The need for money finally prompted Buddy to look for work. In 
the late 1930s, he founded Mailings, Inc., a pioneer in the field of 
direct mailing. The company was an instant success, and in March 
1939, he married Jane Wessel, his childhood sweetheart. 
The marriage didn't last long. After fabricating all sorts of stories 
to cover up his gambling, Buddy left on Friday for Philadelphia to 
close a deal with Curtis Publishing. On Saturday, Jane received a 
telegram informing her of a snag in the negotiations. Sunday 
brought still another telegram describing a further delay. When he 
returned on Monday, his wife was gone, and he had lost the one 
person he loved. He was truly heartbroken, but his many well­
intentioned promises could not win her back. 
When World War II broke out, Buddy was drafted. He became 
Sergeant Simonson and landed up in England. I remember reading 
about his winning a game in a 1944 Allied Forces chess match that 
included the likes of Dr. Tartakower and Jacques Mieses. But then I 
lost track of him completely. Years, then decades rolled by, and one 
day he called. We had lunch together, and he told me his story. 
After getting out of the service, Buddy married an Englishwoman 
and fathered a lovely young girl. He and his wife separated, and he 
returned to the States. Then, he married a third time and produced 
two more children. As was the case earlier, he still smoked in 
chains, even though he looked pale and coughed constantly. While 
thus bringing me up to date, Buddy seemed distracted and repeat­
edly looked around the room as if expecting to see someone at any 
moment. If only I could have stopped my mind from racing back to 
that dapper young man I once knew so well, then our reunion 
would have been more pleasant.

Months later, I received a call from one of his associates. Buddy 
had died of a cause related to emphysema while visiting San Juan, 
Puerto Rico. The time was mid-November 1965, and he had just 
celebrated his 51st birthday. The services were held at All Souls 
Unitarian up near 80th and Lexington, and as I sat by myself at the 
funeral of a man whom I had regarded fondly, and as I tried to 
huddle deeper into my overcoat that chilly New York morning of 
November 24, all I could think of was . . .  
What a waste.

Queen's Gambit is no longer the king of openings, and few players shed tears

Chapter V 
'fhe $rightened, fittle cf\_abbit 
Abraham Kupchik was a timid, tiny whisper of a man with the 
saddest eyes and the most disproportionately large nose on a small 
face that I have ever seen. He was barely five feet tall in his stocking 
feet and at most 115 pounds. Some wag once remarked that 
Kupchik and Sammy Reshevsky ought to be matched for the fly­
weight championship of the chess world. 
If chess were nothing more than an analytical science with a 
pinch of art thrown in, then Kupchik would probably have made it 
into the pantheon of players. But chess is more than that. And what 
most people fail to understand is that it is also a sport in which 
stamina, the power to concentrate for long periods of time, and the 
personal courage to dare are as important as the disembodied cate­
gories of science and art. Moreover, as chess knowledge has become 
democratized and individual research less essential, the game's 
animal elements have become progressively more important. 
Alas, Abe Kupchik was so lacking in physical substance that he 
seemed in perpetual danger of becoming the man who was no 
longer there. Whenever he came to the Manhattan Chess Club, 
which was usually on weekends, he was always impeccably dressed 
and well-groomed. Not a single gray hair (he was born in 1892, and 
I came to know him in the 1930s) was ever out of place, though he 
had the habit of constantly fluffing his hair with filigree-like fingers. 
For some reason, these gestures made him look like a Koala bear­
an impression that, in retrospect, may have had more to do with his 
being the only person I ever met who looked sad and worried even 
when smiling. 
Kup Did Not Run Over 
Kupchik's chess was like his personality. A gentle man, whom many 
club members called "Kuppele" or "Kup," he was repulsed at the 
idea of attacking an opponent from the very start. One looks in vain 
among his games for a short, highly tactical win. Such was not his 
strategy, which was purely defensive. Kuppele waited for opponents 
to crack under the strain of banging their pieces against an iron de-

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
fense, which they did in great numbers. This style, combined with 
his phenomenally quick sight of the board, was extremely effective 
in 10-second chess. Until about 1930, he had no equal in this 
country at the fast game. At the 1926 Lake Hopatcong Interna­
tional, he finished ahead of Jose Capablanca in the lightning event. 
Kuppele remained a real power at speed chess into the 1940s, finish­
ing third in the 1943 national championship. Here is an example of 
how fluidly, if not pointedly, he could push pieces:

The winner of this game will be the player who proves better at 
doing absolutely nothing. The idea is to maintain a rhythmic mo­
tion of hand-piece-release, hand-piece-release and so on. If one play­
er conceives an idea and interrupts this rhythm, he will surely lose.

Kuppele was also no slouch at slow chess. His two best results 
were equal first with Frank Marshall at Lake Hopatcong 1923 and a 
clear second behind Capablanca (but ahead of Geza Maroczy and 
Marshall) at the Lake Hopatcong fixture of 1926. He also won the 
Manhattan Chess Club championship nine times outright and once 
jointly, and if that is not a record, it ought to be. At the 1935 
Warsaw Olympiad, he held down third board, scoring +6 =8. In the 
U.S. championships of 1936, 1938 and 1940, he always seemed to 
be finishing about sixth. His victory over Reuben Fine in the 1940 
event was vintage, if that is quite the right word, Kupchik:

A year earlier in the annual Marshall vs. Manhattan Met League

In the following little-known game, Kupchik is at his best. I think 
that he makes numerous moves of which Anatoly Karpov would 
approve.

If Kuppele was already past his prime in the 1930s, he more than 
held his own against the best of the 1920s. He outpaced the likes of 
Oscar Chajes, Charles Jaffe and Edward Lasker; and he posted a 
small plus against the young Isaac Kashdan. Among Americans, only 
Frank Marshall cast the Indian sign on him. 
Discussing Frank's edge over Kupchik is instructive not only for 
understanding our subject but also for grasping the status of chess 
masters 60 or so years ago. In a phrase, professional chess players 
were social outcasts in the 1920s and 1930s. Capablanca once 
noted, accurately and depressingly, that to be a chess player was a 
sign of a gentleman, but to be a good chess player was a sign of a 
misspent youth. Hence the half-hearted pursuit of chess by those 
masters who could see the dead end ahead; hence also Kuppele's 
passivity in advancing his own cause in chess. 
Kuppele and his family fled Russia and came to America in 1903 .

Call it five-and-dime psychologizing if you must, but I have no 
doubt that the insecurities of his childhood, combined with the 
unattractive prospects offered by the royal game, explain his essen­
tially negative chess style and retiring personality. GM Andy Soltis 
has described Kupchik as "super-solid," but even this emphatic 
American phrase (super bowl, super star, super this and that) fails to 
capture just how conservative he was. As noted, his hunkering down 
into a defensive posture was fine in speed contests, but a top grand­
master could usually steamroll such an obstacle in a slow game:

Another Kupchik weakness was that he often played tournament 
games as if they were speed contests. I always got the impression 
that he did not wish to keep his opponent waiting. Capablanca 
described the drawbacks of this approach in Diario de la Marina 
(March 16, 1913): 
It is obvious that young Kupchik does not play as is proper, 
reflecting upon his moves as would the top player in the 
world; playing with great rapidity, he tries to win against an 
opponent who is as strong as he, if not stronger . . .  .I believe 
that, given his age, the young Russian plays very well, but if 
he is ever to become somebody, it will be necessary for him 
to think much more. 
All of which explains why Kuppele failed to grasp a grand oppor­
tunity by grabbing a pawn against Capablanca himself:

The Professional Toil 
Chess eventually became only a weekend game for Kupchik. His 
inability to push forward either chess pieces or himself took its pro­
fessional toll. An example of how he was an object rather than a 
subject of other men can be found in a private letter sent by 
Norbert Lederer to Alexander Alekhine concerning who would play 
at the famous New York 1924 International. "We have decided, 
upon my urging recommendation," wrote Lederer, "not to invite 
Kupchik and Chajes, since they would just extend the length of the 
tournament without being able to change anything in the end 
result." Considering that Kupchik had a superior record to at least 
two of the New York participants, he could have made a lot of noise 
about his exclusion. 
Kuppele did not. Indeed, could not. This family man, who had

68 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
two children and lived at the far end of Brooklyn, was so timid that 
if he had a favor to ask he would sort of back into the request rather 
than speak directly. I will never forget the day that he received a 
letter from the IRS that required an answer. Instead of coming to 
the point, he first asked if I had an envelope. When I inquired why 
he needed an envelope, he talked about sending a letter to some­
one, etc. etc. Finally, I pried the information out of him, and we got 
to the point and dispatched the letter. All this worry about sending 
a letter to the tax man from someone who was by profession an . . .  
accountant! 
Since his death in 1970, I think now and then of sweet Kuppele. 
I think of him as he was by the 1960s-an old and fleshy man who 
wore ancient brown suits two sizes too small. And I wonder what 
he might have accomplished had he not been such a frightened little 
rabbit.

Chapter VI 
'fhe Incomparable Max 
Founded in the late 1870s, the Manhattan Chess Club has always 
been a gathering point for chess devotees from all walks of life. The 
highest and sometimes the lowest on the social scale mingle as 
equals. The only requirement is that a man play chess and conduct 
himself as befits a gentleman. 
During the Great Depression, the Manhattan was an ideal place to 
relax and forget the day's troubles. After a couple of hours 
wandering through the maze of combinations afforded by the royal 
game, one returned to ground zero refreshed and, if one happened 
upon a "customer," financially restored. Of the time I now write, a 
man named Max was the club secretary. He loved chess more than 
life, and he was happiest when seated at the board and in control. 
Royalty knew no greater power or joy. 
For a period in his life, Max dedicated himself completely to the 
Manhattan; and the members appreciated and, indeed, loved him for 
his hard work and human warmth. His was one of man's rarest gifts: 
to see life in a humorous light and to reflect that light without ever 
becoming offensive. Max often told stories about club members that 
delighted his listeners, including many of the guilty parties. 
I will never forget his account of how a highly respected elder 
member, who was known for his propriety, absentmindedly reached 
for a Bishop in the heat of battle and used it to stir his coffee. A bit 
later, when preparing to move the missing Bishop, he angrily ac­
cused his opponent of removing it from the board. Imagine the 
"oldest member's" chagrin, to borrow a phrase from P.G. Wade­
house, when he discovered it resting at the bottom of his coffee cup. 
Max was a master at giving odds to weaker players, who because 
of his wonderful way with people, never resented losing money to 
him. Many actually sought him out in the belief that they were 
contributing to his upkeep. Few people knew that Max was a very 
wealthy man, who while still in his 20s, struck it rich in commodi­
ties speculation. He then invested his winnings in real estate, hoping 
to establish an income that would free him for his favorite hobby. 
Instead, he hit a second jackpot and sold out for a fortune at the 
71

72 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
peak of the market. 
It was a Saturday morning that we became friends. I arrived at 
the club unusually early, and only Max was there. Although we 
knew each other, we had never really talked. I tried to break the ice 
by showing him a chess problem that had fascinated me since age 
13. As soon as I set up the pieces, he shouted, "Reti," the com­
poser's name. And we suddenly found ourselves talking like old 
friends. 
Over the next decade, I saw a lot of Max and his wife, Renee, a 
warm, butterball of a woman. On many occasions, we all dined to­
gether. After dinner, Max and I usually stayed up most of the night 
playing and talking. 
Somehow we fell out of contact. The need to earn a living, the 
time demanded by marriage and children, a subsequent move to the 
suburbs-it's the same story for most people. Not until 1975, after 
retiring to Florida, did I begin to miss the Manhattan Chess Club 
and my old friends in the Big Apple. And so, I rented a small 
apartment not far from the club. 
The Real Top Dog 
I had not seen Max for almost 20 years and was totally unprepared 
for the shock when we came face to face. Or, rather, what was left 
of his face. After Max was diagnosed as having cancer of the 
jawbone, the doctors removed it to save his life. His customary 
buoyancy was gone along with much of the humor and wit. 
Although still in his 60s, he looked much older. And no wonder. To 
see a de-boned, wrecked face every morning while shaving would be 
enough to crush anyone's spirits. 
Yet Max retained a wonderful way of expressing himself, and as 
he brought me up to date, I forgot about his looks. He seemed to 
have made peace with himself, and as he later proved over the 
board, his chess had not suffered. But I was sorely mistaken about 
Max enjoying internal quiet as I learned at our next get-together. 
"My marriage is falling apart," he confided, "and I cannot see a 
way to save it. When I first met Renee, there was no one more 
beautiful. I was so deeply in love that nothing else mattered. She 
was not as deeply in love, but I made allowances for this 
shortcoming so long as I did not have to share her. Mind you, we 
had our differences, but we got along most of the time." 
Max paused and sighed. "During the past year," he continued, 
"she has gone completely off the deep end. All she does is primp 
and fuss over that silly poodle, Bobo. He has replaced me in her

bed, and I've been moved to a room down the hall. When I try to 
discuss the issue, she says that I'm acting silly. I should have taken a 
stand right after coming out of the hospital. Now it's too late." 
Whistle While You Work 
We did not meet again for several weeks. And when we did, Max's 
eyes shone brightly, though not with the witty twinkle of yore. 
They were like two searchlights peering into the distance. His lips 
quivered almost convulsively. He was clearly in the grip of a great 
mission and spoke urgently, mopping his face and trying to contain 
an excitement. 
"I have a plan," he said feverishly, "that will break up this canine 
conspiracy to wreck my home. On my way here to the club, I pass 
a pet shop; and I've been thinking what would happen if I bought 
one of those silent dog whistles and blew it occasionally in the wee 
morning hours. Chances are that Bobo would come charging into 
my room where I can greet him with a piece of his favorite choco­
late. Arnold, you've heard about conditioned reflexes and Pavlov's 
dog? What do I have to lose? And if nothing else, it will surely 
upset Renee." 
Max proved a prophet. "The plan is working," he beamed happily 
some weeks later. "Renee is so upset that she is even considering a 
dog psychiatrist for Bobo." 
As the summer months wore on, Max became increasingly 
pleased with himself. He seemed happy and expectant. Renee was 
nervous and distraught. The poor woman could not understand 
why Bobo got up in the middle of the night and dashed from her 
bedroom as if he had left a steak bone on the 5:15 to Yonkers. 
Renee fought back as best she could. After consulting a bar­
keeper's wife, whom she came to know while out walking Bobo, she 
became convinced that "her baby" was possessed by evil spirits. 
Later, after prayers and poultices applied by the barkeeper's wife 
failed utterly, Renee looked for a dog psychiatrist. Finding none, 
she began to seek advice from everyone she met, no matter how 
limited the person's experience or remote his occupation. If sheer 
inquiry could save Bobo, then the dog had nothing to worry his 
curly head about. 
On one occasion, Renee came to the club to pick up Max and 
spoke about Bobo's dilemma. "Can you imagine a big city like New 
York with no place to take a poor, disturbed animal like my Bobo. 
They spend millions on literally everything, but nobody gives a 
hang about a poor dog's nerves." Then, turning to Bobo and 
kneeling down to hug the hound and to tousle the well-coiffed hair

7 4 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
atop his head, she said, "Don't worry darling-urns, mommy-urns will 
find someone to help you." 
Bobo's Sixth Sense 
Help came quickly. Strolling along Fifth Avenue a few days later, I 
bumped into Renee and Bobo. She was wearing a large, striking 
black lace hat that reached to her shoulders. Her dress was lacy 
black as well, and several strands of pearls were intertwined around 
her neck like a boa constrictor. Even Bobo had gotten into the 
spirit of things by wearing a hat similar to Renee's. 
I tipped my hat and remarked on how well they both looked, 
since it would have been impolite to exclude Bobo. She explained 
that the reason for the matching outfits was that Max had passed 
away. The very night of his passing, she had been unable to sleep 
and as she paced the floor, something drew her to Max's room. He 
lay on the floor near the threshold. "Arnold," she whispered on the 
busy street, "what do you think he was up to? You could never 
guess. Can you imagine a man of his age playing with a whistle and 
eating chocolates in the middle of the night?" 
She continued, "When I summoned the doctor, he said that it 
was not unusual for some aging men to start acting silly. They yearn 
for their lost youth and make complete fools of themselves by 
chasing after and blowing whistles at young women. Poor Max, he 
must have been entering his second childhood." 
"You know," she concluded, "I should have had more faith in 
Bobo's sixth sense. His instincts told him that there was something 
wrong with Max, and that was why he couldn't sleep normally. How 
else can you explain that since Max died, Bobo once again sleeps 
like a baby?"

Chapter VI I 
fi JCnight in Shining firmor 
No account of chess in the 1930s and 1940s would be complete 
without mentioning Maurice Wertheim. Like a knight in shining 
armor who gallops out of a mist, Maurice arrived unexpectedly on 
the New York chess scene at a moment when there was much 
wailing and gnashing of teeth. The "world famous Manhattan Chess 
Club"-as it was called-had been reduced to slumming in the 
crummy cellar of the Pythian Temple somewhere on West 70th. As 
a consequence, many of the club's illustrious chess citizens were 
living solely by their wits because of a customer shortage. 
What Damon Runyon wrote about "guys and dolls" also obtained 
among us chess men during the Great Depression: "Now it comes on 
the spring . . .  after a long hard winter, and times are very tough 
indeed, what with the stock market going all to pieces, and banks 
busting right and left, and the law getting very nasty about this and 
that, and one thing and another, and many citizens of this town are 
compelled to do the best they can. There is very little scratch any­
where and along Broadway many citizens are wearing their last 
year's clothes and have practically nothing to bet on the races or 
anything else, and it is a condition that will touch anybody's heart." 
Including, as it happened, the great heart of Maurice Wertheim, 
who was a one-in-a-million man for sure. In August 1941, without 
fear or hesitation, he singlehandedly moved the Manhattan to pala­
tial quarters at 100 Central Park South, on the corner of 6th 
Avenue and 59th Street. And suddenly, New York's professional 
chess citizens began to thrive again-this time on gilt-edged custom­
ers who had plenty of quarters to lose. 
Maurice the Man 
Medium in height and not much to look at, Maurice radiated a 
warmth and confidence that swept up even the gloomiest of us 
chess Guses. Those ruddy red cheeks, that bristling brown mustache 
and those ever-friendly brown eyes brimming with enthusiasm ener­
gized everyone. I never saw him negative or angry, though a man in 
his position must have had enemies. I still believe that his sincerity 
75

76 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
and positive outlook probably won over even business competitors. 
As one of his daughters wrote, "MW, as friends and family called 
him, almost always wanted to be in a position to give activities form 
and direction, to innovate and create." 
That gets it just right. No Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance, 
he! 
Born in 1886, Maurice was head of the banking firm of Wertheim 
& Company, which he founded in 1927. He was a multi-millionaire 
back when a dollar still had 100 cents. Yet he did not toss around 
money. He believed that even cultural organizations ought to run 
on a business basis and that organizations lacking the support of 
society had no right to exist. Maurice's early experience as a founder 
and director of the then floundering New York Theatre Guild proba­
bly brought this lesson home. In his "1931 Report to the Harvard 
Class of 1906," he described his hands-on approach. "My chief out­
side interest during these 25 years," he wrote, "has been the 
theatre. From the time of graduation until 1919, I was connected 
with various amateur theatre groups, whose activities culminated in 
1919 in the New York Theatre Guild. Ever since its formation, I 
have been a member of the board of managers and active in its op­
erations. Up to date the organization has produced over 75 plays." 
In the early 1930s, Maurice led the cultural battle to stage Eugene 
O'Neill's controversial, dark and seminal trilogy, Mourning Becomes 
Electra. 
Having gotten the Theatre Guild on its feet, Maurice then insisted 
that the child walk on its own. And for the record, the Guild did 
just that during his tenure-as did the Manhattan Chess Club. 
I think that Maurice was a believer in what we today call "tough 
love," though he also had a soft side. He was a trustee of the 
American Wildlife Foundation, and in 194 7, this extraordinarily 
wealthy man donated to the U.S. government his 2,000-acre Long 
Island shooting preserve, which is now called the Wertheim National 
Wildlife Refuge and which extends along the Montauk Highway all 
the way to Great South Bay. "It's an ideal place for migrating ducks 
to rest," Maurice said shortly after deeding over his property, "or 
would be if I didn't shoot them." 
When looking to relax and go for a swim or to attend to some 
business for the Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company (of which he was a 
director), Maurice always repaired to his home on Cuba's Veradero 
Beach. He also had a passion that bordered on a weakness for 
salmon fishing. "The salmon," Maurice wrote in Salmon on the Dry 
Fly, a privately published and beautifully produced little book of 
500 copies, "is a lordly fish. He is not like your wee trout and 
knows that the bait cannot escape him. So he takes the fly as he

pleases." 
Chapter VII 
77 
Maurice kept a house up in Canada on the Gaspe Peninsula and 
leased the entire Ste. Anne des Monts River just to toss in a line 
during the peak salmon season of June and July. "Father was a pas­
sionate fisherman, so much so that when his first grandchild was 
born," recalls one of his daughters, "he announced that he had been 
awake all night figuring out how old he would be when the baby 
boy could take his first salmon, in order that he could teach him 
the fine points of the sport." Maurice once wrote about his adven­
tures in the March 1948 issue of Field & Stream. 
Maurice the Chess Man 
If movie moguls race cars and media men yachts, bankers go in for 
high culture. Beginning in 1936 at age 50, Maurice became within 
two or three years one of the world's leading collectors of French 
Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Paintings by Degas, Dufy, 
Gauguin, Manet, Matisse, Monet, Picasso, Renoir, van Gogh and the 
like graced the walls of his penthouse at 33 East 70th. All told, 
Maurice purchased 43 paintings, drawings and sculptures, many of 
which are, as the critic John O'Brian states, "standard points of 
reference" in art literature. He is talking about such immediately 
recognizable masterpieces as van Gogh's "Self-Portrait Dedicated to 
Paul Gauguin," Degas' "The Rehearsal" and "Singer with a Glove," 
Renoir's "Seated Bather" and "Self-Portrait at Thirty-Five," and 
Gauguin's "Poemes Barbares." The best book on Maurice's beloved 
collection is O'Brian's Degas to Matisse: the Maurice Wertheim 
Collection. 
Still, Maurice loved most the thing that cost him least: correspon­
dence chess. He carried on games all over the world, and one in par­
ticular with John J. McCloy, an old banking buddy who became 
High Commissioner for Germany following World War II. I like to 
think that as a renowned banker, Maurice enjoyed telling opponents 
that a check was in the mail. Certainly, he took the games seriously 
and often discussed them with me in his study, though only those 
games already concluded. He never permitted comments on games 
in progress. 
Playing under the pseudonym of "A.C. Charles," Maurice scored 
well in the old Chess Review postal tournaments of the early 
1940s. In the Victory Postal Tournament of 1943, he scored +13 -1 
=4, good enough to snatch a prize and to earn him a rating of 1430, 
which was the equivalent of a master rating today. Indeed, future 
correspondence world champion Hans Berliner was then rated at 
1418. Maurice later described his performance in this tournament as 
the "proudest moment of my chess career." And as Chess Review

78 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
described his postal routine: "Every morning, on his way to Wall 
Street in a taxi, he played over variations of his games on a pocket 
chess set. In the evenings, while waiting for dinner guests to arrive, 
he set up his board and studied his games. Wherever he went, his 
Postal Chess Album accompanied him. Nothing was permitted to 
interfere with this fascinating hobby." 
Maurice had a feel for the French Defense and even invented 
interesting, if dubious ideas. Take, for example, the rare line, 1. P­
K4 P-K3 2. P-Q4 P-Q4 3. N-QB3 B-N5 4. P-QR3 BxNch 5. PxB PxP 
6. Q-N4 Q-B3 ! ?  7. QxKP. As Black against Bela Rozsa, a many-time 
champion of Oklahoma, Maurice found the completely new move, 
7. . . . Q-N3 !?, which led to a playable game after 8. B-Q3 (the 
alternative is 8. Q-B4 QxBP 9. QxP N-QB3 10. B-Q2 [Grandmaster 
Larry Evans suggests 10. N-K2 here] 10 . . . .  NxP, when Black wins a 
pawn) 8 . . . .  QxQ 9. BxQ N-KB3 10. B-B3 QN-Q2 11. P-B4?! (Evans 
believes that 11. B-B4! puts Black's idea to the test) 11. . . .  P-K4! .  
I n  the following Queenless middlegame, Maurice outplays a New 
York master noted for his handling of just this kind of position:

White wants to double Black's Queen pawn, but he deprives his 
own pieces of the natural squares, QB4 and K4. Al Horowitz 
suggested 14. P-N3 as a better move.

White's idea is to play 23. B-R4 and 24. B-N3. Still, Black can 
probably win a sound pawn after 22 . . . .  P-N4 23. K-B3 (if 23. BxB, 
Black will pick up the QBP after 23 . . . .  RxB 24. N-Q7 R/3-B3) 23 .

40 . . . .  P-R4! 4 1 .  K-B4 PxP 42. KxP N-B3 4 3. B-N2 N-N5, White resigns 
A mopping-up line would be 44. P-Q4 N-Q6 45. B-Rl P-NS 46. K­
B3 P-N6 47. K-K3 P-N7, and Black wins. By no means a glowing 
game, but Maurice turned in a steady positional effort. As Hermann 
Helms once wrote of Maurice's play, "While not a top ranking player 
in any sense, he still can give a good tussle to many masters with 
more experience." 
As we came to know each other better, Maurice talked often 
about his youth. His first marriage was to Alma Morgenthau, a 
daughter of Henry Morgenthau, Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of the 
treasury. They produced three girls, the most famous of whom was 
Barbara Tuchman, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian who wrote 
such works as The Guns of August and The Proud Tower. After the 
girls grew up, Maurice and his wife divorced. He later married a tall 
and beautiful blue-eyed Swedish lady, who was the widow of Gene 
Seiberling of auto-tire fame. Cecile, who died in 197 4, was perfect 
for Maurice. I think that they were the happiest couple that I ever 
knew.

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
One evening after dinner, Maurice told me the story behind his 
success. First, his father made a lot of money with the United Cigar 
Manufacturers Company, sent him to Harvard whence he graduated 
in 1906, and then left him almost half a million dollars. He got into 
investment banking in 1915 with Hallgarten & Company and be­
came a partner in 1919. There, he studied and mastered the fine art 
of mergers, striking pay dirt when he convinced two banks that 
they would be better off as one. Consummated in St. Louis, this 
merger was his first million-dollar deal. Maurice cried with joy on 
the train all the way back to New York. Other killings followed. 
Strange to say, Maurice was a man of the political left. He served 
as owner and publisher of The Nation from 1935 to 193 7, and his 
breast fairly burst with an admirable passion for social justice. He 
never confused being born on third base and reaching home on a 
single with smacking a home run. As president of the American Jew­
ish Committee in 1941-42, he produced a direct answer to Hitler­
ism by converting that organization to Zionism. Barbara Tuchman 
described this achievement as "probably the most difficult and his­
torically the most important action of his career." 
Maurice's minus side, along with that of The Nation in the 1930s 
and 1940s, was imagining that Joseph Stalin was merely a tangier 
and spicier version of an American liberal. Maurice and others like 
him believed that Stalin was devoted not to mass murder in the tens 
of millions but to improving upon Jeffersonian liberalism by usher­
ing it into the sunny egalitarian uplands of economic and social 
democracy. "I feel that no one should miss the present opportu­
nity," he wrote about a projected trip in the early 1930s to a Soviet 
Union ravaged by terror and mass famine, "of studying there one of 
the most interesting experiments in the development of a new social 
order that has ever been attempted." 
"Interesting?" Good grief. More anon about how this fantastic 
delusion indirectly helped not only my chess but also my bank 
account! 
Maurice Makes His Move 
In May 1941, shortly after being elected president of the Manhattan 
Chess Club, Maurice made his first double-exclam move in chess by 
bankrolling a U.S. championship match between AI Horowitz, the 
challenger, and Sammy Reshevsky, the reigning champion since 
1936. I'll never forget the first game of that hard-fought struggle 
because the site was Maurice's penthouse, which in its "streamlined 
modernity," as one art critic wrote, was without "a sliver or stitch 
of the antique." Virtually all of New York's top players attended, 
and the crowd numbered at least 150.

Maurice liked being around chess people-no doubt about it. 
When I won the U. S. Chess Championship in 1944, he went all out 
and gave a gala party. At least 75 people attended, and never had I 
seen more champagne and caviar. Not even at the Russian embassy! 
To top it all off, he presented me with a gold watch and platinum 
chain inscribed by members of the Manhattan. An unforgettable 
evening-for anyone. 
In the summer of '41, a very strong New York State Champion­
ship was held upstate on the campus of Colgate University in Hamil­
ton. The field included the likes of Reshevsky, Reuben Fine, Al 
Horowitz, Isaac Kashdan and, of course, myself. Maurice wanted to 
spend a few days kibitzing, and so the four of us-he and Cecile, my 
wife Nina and 1-tossed our golf clubs and tennis rackets into a 
woody station wagon. With Maurice's ever-present "man" at the 
wheel, we set off for what turned out to be a wonderful chess vaca­
tion. If memory serves, Fine scored something like 8-2 to finish 
first. I ended in a tie for 2nd-4th with Sammy and Kash. Maurice 
loved watching the action ("He couldn't see a mate through a tele­
scope," was one of his favorite kibitzes) and got a big kick out of 
my explaining the chief ideas. He also competed in a lower section, 
scoring a respectable 6-3. 
On numerous occasions, Maurice showed his appreciation for my 
small services by having Nina and me over for dinner, a highlight of 
which was getting to savor his great collection of Impressionist 
paintings. One of my two favorites was Toulouse-Lautrec's "The 
Black Countess," a singularly witty canvas depicting a dark-skinned, 
elegantly clad lady driving a carriage wildly along a Mediterranean 
beach near Nice. My other favorite, a much larger painting, was 
Picasso's "Mother and Child" from the artist's Blue Period. It never 
failed to move me, and in a touching gesture typical of Maurice, he 
always saw to it that I sat opposite the picture during dinner. 
My admiration for "Mother and Child" was not, however, shared 
by Anne Wertheim, Maurice's youngest daughter. In a family mem­
oir, Barbara Tuchman describes a tiff between Father and Daughter: 
"Later, [they] had a mighty battle when she refused to get married 
under Picasso's Blue Period painting of a syphilitic mother and 
infant, which was hung over the fireplace, and he refused to take it 
down. The family lawyer resolved the deadlock with a diplomatic 
compromise-a smilax curtain draped over the painting to be re­
moved instantly after the ceremony." 
On May 27, 1950, Maurice Wertheim died suddenly of a heart 
attack at his estate in Cos Cob, Connecticut. He left his collection 
of Impressionist works to the Fogg Museum at Harvard. During the 
1988 U.S. Open in Boston, I took the opportunity to visit Harvard

82 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
and to renew my acquaintance with these old and haunting friends. 
To Russia with Love 
Maurice spent his life bringing people together, whether they were 
chess players or international bankers. This talent came to the 
attention of Franklin Roosevelt, who made Maurice one of his 
dollar-a-year men on the War Production Board. He quickly became 
an official goodwill ambassador, conceiving the idea of and signing 
the checks for the famous U.S.A.-U.S.S.R. match held in Moscow in 
1946. Maurice convinced Foggy Bottom that a friendly chess match 
might help to thaw out the oncoming Cold War, harbingers of 
which were Stalin's conquest of Eastern Europe and his frosty 
treatment of American envoys. 
Naive, true. But Maurice was right in one respect: No group ever 
got a grander reception than that accorded us upon arriving in 
Moscow. We were drowned in flowers at the airport and treated like 
royalty, if that is quite the metaphor. At the playing site, the 
crowds were so huge that the team-flanked by secret police 
types-had to leave the theater via a side entrance. Still, Maurice's 
idea ultimately counted for little because all the good will in the 
world between the American and Russian peoples amounted to 
nothing in Stalin's arithmetic. As Maurice later stated in The New 
Yorker of August 14, 1948, "I thought it was up to the private citi­
zens of this country to do what they could to support the efforts of 
the State Department to encourage a relationship with Russia on a 
basis other than business or war. I'm afraid I didn't accomplish my 
purpose in a long-range way, but I did a lot at the moment." 
In retrospect, the chief beneficiary of the Moscow match may 
have been myself. Not only did I spend several months in Europe 
sharpening my chess, I also indirectly benefited financially by being 
in the wrong place at the right time. 
The wrong place was a sidewalk cafe in Paris where I was reading 
catastrophic news in the Herald Tribune. "Billions Lopped Off U.S. 
Stock Market" screamed a headline. Nina and I had worked hard to 
save about $20,000, which we invested in stocks. I was sick at heart 
and decided that the market was no place for a tyro and would get 
out once I got home. However, the right time turned out to be that 
very moment because Maurice, with whom we were travelling, sud­
denly came along and sat down for coffee. 
After some hesitation, I worked up the courage to tell Maurice 
about my dilemma. Without skipping a beat, he replied, "I'll send 
my chauffeur for you when we get back, but be sure to bring me 
your entire portfolio." He was as good as his word. Not long

Chapter VII 
83 
afterward, I found myself sitting in his office at 120 Broadway, wait­
ing along with the then mayor of New York. Soon a smiling Maurice 
stepped out from his private office to lead me inside. Flushed with 
embarrassment, I stammered, "I believe the mayor was here before 
me." To which he replied, "Don't worry, his business can wait." 
Maurice sat behind a large desk and pored over my holdings. 
After a while, he looked up and asked, "Who advised you to buy 
such garbage?" Although his firm never bothered in those days with 
accounts under $100,000, he personally supervised my portfolio. 
Before he died a few years later, he got back every penny I lost 
along with a good deal more. My small account sat at Wertheim & 
Company after his death until I decided to close it so as not to 
embarrass the firm any longer. 
Maurice Meets Yankele 
Only once did Maurice permit Nina and me to take him and his wife 
to dinner. Knowing their love for French cuisine, I chose my 
favorite restaurant, La Toque Blanche. We all dined sumptuously, 
though what I remember best are certain surprises later on. For 
some reason, we got on to the topic of older players like Oscar 
Chajes, Charles Jaffe and, of course, Frank Marshall. The subject 
then shifted to chess institutions on the lower East Side-joints 
such as the Cafe Royale and the Stuyvesant Chess Club. Maurice 
said that he had visited neither of them, and then added abruptly, 
"Let's leave the ladies to their dessert and coffee. We can be back in 
half an hour." 
A minute later, Maurice's chauffeur was driving us to the Stuyve­
sant down on East 14th. On the way, I got a chance to ask this 
kindest of powerful men about the source of his understanding of 
people and their problems. Maurice recalled a seemingly insignifi­
cant episode when he was a student at Harvard. A young woman, 
whom he barely knew, approached him and began to pour out her 
troubles. As he tried to get away, she followed, telling him that her 
parents were getting divorced and that she was having problems 
keeping up with her studies. He must have appeared bored because 
she said angrily, "The least you can do is listen. You will lose 
nothing and may gain a great deal in human understanding and 
stature." Maurice said that this utterly banal encounter, so micro­
scopic in the macrocosm of massive human suffering, stayed with 
him and dictated his treatment of people ever after. 
The Stuyvesant Chess Club was packed as usual. Yet everyone in 
the place looked up when we entered. Maurice was immaculately 
groomed as always, and most of the chess players stared at him as 
if he were the Messiah. Almost immediately, the proprietor, Jacob

84 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Bernstein, came to greet us. Jacob or "Yankele" was short, fat and 
almost completely bald, but he owned a smile as big as his chess 
talent. I introduced him to Maurice, and before you could count 
three, the two men wandered off, leaving me standing alone. 
To my complete surprise, they returned several minutes later, 
chatting like old friends and sipping hot tea from glasses ensconced 
in those ornate silver holders that Russians call podstakanniki. 
On our way back to La Toque, my curiosity got the better of me. 
"What were you and Yankele discussing so earnestly?" I asked. 
"Oh," he replied, "he told me that they played a lot of 'pinochle' up 
on the second floor, and I told him that my father was considered 
one of the finest 'pinochle' players in the cigar industry." By "pi­
nochle," Maurice really meant, of course, poker. 
And then this captain of international banking and confidant of 
history-making statesmen began to stare distractedly out of the 
window of his limousine, saying nothing for several minutes. "You 
know," he finally spoke up in a thoughtful and faraway voice, "in 
spite of the squalid quarters, the smoke and the noise, everyone 
seemed to be having a real good time."

'fhe J(enesaw Mountain 
J:gndis of Chess 
From the 1920s into the late 1940s, the Manhattan Chess Club was 
more or less run by L. Walter Stephens, a rigid and humorless man 
whom I once nicknamed "Mr. Faux Pas." He was best known to the 
American chess public of the period as the perennial tournament 
director of U. S. championship events. 
L. Walter, as he was commonly called, was the kind of person 
who never got a second look when he passed by on the street. But if 
you're the kind of the reader who wants to get a second look, then 
riffle through old issues of the New York Times until reaching page 
23 of the edition for May 8, 1944. You will find a photograph 
showing a virile and hirsute young Greek god, elegantly "accou­
tered" (a buzz word in this story) in a three-piece suit. That's me, 
impartially described. I am holding a trophy for winning the U.S. 
Chess Championship and am staring as if I wished to wring the 
scrawny neck of a dour, bespectacled man of medium height and 
blotchy, freckled complexion. This man, who was born in 1883 , 
covered impending baldness by parting his hair just above the left 
ear and plastering it across his narrow dome to the other ear. That's 
L. Walter, equally impartially described. 
For years L. Walter and wife Maude ran the Manhattan Chess 
Club as if it were the family plantation. The club became their 
second home. L. Walter, who had once been pastor of the Presbyte­
rian Church of Oceanside, Long Island, was an economics and 
history teacher at the New York High School of Commerce. Maude 
was a tall, pencil-thin lady with a weakness for flowered hats as lush 
and wild as any tropical jungle. She was also the club secretary 
(from 1942 to 1954) and performed her duties with quiet efficiency 
in spite of her husband's occasional interference. As for L. Walter, 
who had held the post of secretary from 1924 to 1941, he somehow 
assumed the role of club manager. In said capacity and with no 
clearly defined duties, this zealous tumor from Princeton's Union 
Theological Seminary managed to get into everything. He directed 
85

86 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
tournaments, arranged team matches, set up rules for juniors, talked 
to delinquents about dues and established a dress code. 
Yes, a dress code. L. Walter liked to spend his spare time thinking 
up rules to drive people nuts-a malignant talent that he doubt­
lessly honed while serving during World War I as a YMCA chaplain 
and athletic director at Camp Mills, Long Island. 
During most of L. Walter's regime at the Manhattan, juniors were 
allowed to come to the club only on certain days and at specified 
times. On one occasion in the 1940s, a future chess great came to 
the club in his then-customary T-shirt and blue jeans. L. Walter, 
with foam forming on his lower lip, demanded that the young 
genius be tossed out at once. "He's breaking my dress code by 
coming here improperly accoutered," screamed our fearless leader. 
Fortunately, I garnered the support of a majority of the club's 
directors, including Walter's wife, to stop him. And forever after, 
"Mr. Princeton '10," as he sometimes dubbed himself, stared daggers 
at me whenever I came to the club. 
In truth L. Walter was the last person to talk about being 
"improperly accoutered," for he often sported outfits that would 
have put Florian Slappey, the "sepia gentleman" of Octavus Roy 
Cohen fame, to shame. I still recall the St. Patrick's Day when he 
turned up wearing green suspenders, purple trousers, and an orange 
shirt with shoes to match. Bob Willman, one of the wags, remarked, 
"Maude must be selecting his clothes to match her hats." 
"You, You . . .  Patzer, You!" 
Most of the younger club members barely tolerated L. Walter and 
told jokes about him too off-color to relate even in these pagan 
times. But the day that he got Oscar Tenner's dander up was a real 
lulu. Sad-eyed Oscar was one of the old-timers and a chess 
professional who married very late in life. He came to the club with 
his young son on the days that his wife worked. Like most middle­
aged men who sire children, he was particularly proud of his 
handiwork. Indeed, the lad knew how to set up the pieces, and as 
the youngster went from board to board fingering the men, L. 
Walter began to see red. 
Oscar, who was busy with one of his best customers at the far 
end of the room, didn't notice what was going on until he heard his 
"little vun" cry. As L. Walter led the boy by the hand to his father, 
Oscar rose from his chair, ran to meet them, and spluttered, "Take 
your hands off my boy you, you . . .  patzer, you!" Greater insult 
giveth no chess player. 
Although Oscar meant to spear only Stephens, he also harpooned

Chapter VII 
87 
this writer. Now, L. Walter was a fish for sure, but every minnow has 
his day or tournament as a shark. L. Walter's tournament was the 
1941 Manhattan Chess Club Championship in which he defeated 
Boris Blumin brilliantly (a game that he later framed) and drew 
with . . .

At this point, I was probably daydreaming about L. Walter's 
numerous tournament debacles, which the wags used to call "slight 
cases of murder." Fifteen-move losses were not uncommon for him. 
Little did I suspect what was in store for me. 
Though, to be mercilessly objective, I ought to have. L. Walter 
knew nothing about opening theory, and the field of positional play 
was for him terra incognita. Yet as Sherlock Holmes once said of Dr. 
Watson, L. Walter possessed a certain puckish wit that required 
caution. In 1908, he was good enough to play first board for a vic­
torious Princeton in the U.S. national collegiate championship. 
"Princeton owed her success," stated the British Chess Magazine of 
February 1909, "chiefly to the individual efforts of her captain, L. 
Walter Stephens, a graduate of the Brooklyn Boys' School, who 
played at the top board and won every game [three] he played." 
There is even a picture of a young L. Walter on page 32 of the same 
issue. That moment was the high point of his chess career until this 
moment.

After Black's blunder on move 12, White had a won position. 
This kind of game serves as a reminder to every top master never to 
say, "I wouldn't lose to this fish in a million years." As the wags 
used to reply, "How time flies! "  
Another of L. Walter's habits was to subject guests to a third­
degree briefing. He loved to spell out rules and to pry. That's how 
he happened to ask the famous Hungarian master, Lajos Steiner, if 
he played chess. Many of us thought it a mystery why he never 
asked Jose Capablanca to pay dues. 
His One Claim to Fame 
Let me lay my cards on the table. I have an interest in overlooking 
whatever virtue-such as his willingness to endure endless defeats in 
tournaments-L. Walter may have had. Here's the story. 
After scoring 4%--% in the first five rounds of the 1942 U.S. Cham­
pionship, I met Sammy Reshevsky in round six. The game featured 
the maddest time scramble of my career until Sammy's flag fell on 
move 45 or so. L. Walter rushed up, grabbed the clock from behind, 
turned it around so that the opponent's dial was on my side, and 
without the slightest hesitation forfeited . . .  me! 
"A near riot," as Isaac Kashdan described it, broke out. When 
several witnesses tried to reason with L. Walter, he retorted with his 
now famous query, "Does Kenesaw Mountain Landis ever reverse 
himself?" And that supremely stupid statement ended all possible 
discussion. For Judge Landis, the czar of baseball who had been 
appointed to clean up the sport after the White/Black Sox scandal 
of 1919, was notorious for never changing a decision. I played the 
remainder of the tournament, to use Bernard Shaw's memorable 
image, like a squashed cabbage leaf. 
Still, maybe old L. Walter Stephens was cannier than we thought. 
That statement became, after all, his one claim to fame following his 
death on September 30, 1948.

Chess Among the Stars

As a youngster, I never dreamed that I would one day see Holly­
wood. My only contact with Tinsel Town came every Saturday 
afternoon when the heroes of cliff-hanger serials were saved through 
assorted miracles. But in 1946 Herman Steiner, beloved by his 
glamorous Hollywood chess students, performed a miracle of his 
own: He raised the then unprecedented sum (for chess) of $5,000 to 
challenge me for the U.S. Championship title that I had won in 
1944. 
Although our previous results ran heavily in my favor, Herman 
had sound reasons for believing that he could win. (Or, at least, he 
was able to convince his backers that I was a stiff.) Herman beat 
Igor Bondarevsky P/2-% in the 1945 U.S.A. vs. U.S.S.R. radio match, 
the single bright spot for the Americans. Then in January 1946, he 
scored 9-2 to take first place in the strong "Victory" International 
in London. Among those who trailed were Ossip Bernstein and 
Savielly Tartakower. No wonder that Herman's wealthy backers 
were offering six to five on their star. I immediately telephoned a 
few friends in New York, and they covered all bets. 
Luckily, I did not hesitate in contacting the boys back East 
because after the first game, the mood of the Hollywood chess 
crowd changed radically. Hollywood is that way, and I suddenly 
became an official darling. Here's why.

In the second game, Herman hung a piece on move 13. The final 
match score in that sunny May of so long ago was 6-4 in my favor, 
though the reader ought not to shed too many tears for my oppo­
nent. His time came in 1948 when he scored 15-4 to win the na­
tional championship. And while on the subject of Herman's over­
the-board accomplishments, he shared first prize at the 1942 U.S. 
Open and won that tournament outright in 1946. 
But most of us remember not the IM Steiner of Chess. We re­
member Handsome Herman of Hollywood, a dark and virile hunk of 
Hungarian humanity who could have passed as a leading man of the 
silver screen. Arriving in Hollywood from New York in 1932, he 
wrote a chess column for the Los Angeles Times until his death in

1955 at age SO from a heart attack. Among his chess students were 
Humphrey Bogart, Louis Hayward (who played the Saint in movies 
of the 1940s) and Billy Wilder. For Handsome Herman, Hollywood 
was heaven. He enjoyed budding starlets, social prestige and an ade­
quate income. Many were the warm Southern California evenings 
when he frolicked at parties or, as was fitting, pushed chess pieces 
until dawn. "Herman Steiner and George Koltanowski used to come 
over to my place," the late great MGM character actor Fritz Feld 
recalled recently, "and we would play until six o'clock in the 
morning." 
Chess in Old Hollywood 
The perennial problem with writing about Hollywood is to sepa­
rate, as the phrase goes, the real facts from the reel facts. And the 
subject of chess in Old Hollywood-the Hollywood of the 1930s-
1950s and its studio-bred stars-is no exception. 
That there was a large chess following in Old Hollywood may 
seem surprising at first thought. My theory is that a colony of more 
or less permanently ensconced actors, writers, producers and direc­
tors needed diversions. For these creative people, endowed with 
fragile egos and questioning minds, the pastimes of businessmen 
quickly palled. Chess was doubtlessly used to claim intellectual cre­
dentials. 
Back in 1988, a writer in Chess Life compiled a list of Old Holly­
wood greats who loved the game: Lew Ayres, John Barrymore, 
Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Charles Boyer, Charles Coburn, 
Jose Ferrer, Katharine Hepburn, Louis Jourdan and John Wayne. To 
this Oscar-winning cast can be added Nigel Bruce and Basil 
Rathbone (Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively), Charlie 
Chaplin, Helmet Dantine, Linda Darnell, Myrna Loy, Mitzi Mayfair, 
Ray Milland, Margaret Sullavan, Maureen O'Sullivan, Franchot Tone 
and many more. 
Academy Award-winner Milland was an especial chess nut and a 
strong player. Jimmie Fidler, a gossip columnist of the 1930s and 
1940s, once reported, "Unless Ray Milland is suppressed, he will 
have all Hollywood playing chess in another month or two." 
Still, Milland did not consider chess important enough to men­
tion in his wonderful memoir, Wide-Eyed in Babylon; and among 
Hollywood's literati and glitterati, Humphrey Bogart's star burned 
most brightly over the 64 squares. As Bogart put the matter, he 
learned chess "in those old shooting galleries, when I was a kid in 
New York." He even held Sammy Reshevsky to a draw in a simul­
taneous at Romanoffs in Hollywood. A surviving game against

Koltanowski suggests that at his best, he was of expert or master 
strength. This game has been published many times, and what fol­
lows is the lesser-known draw with Reshevsky:

Bogie was smitten with Caissa-no doubt about it. Not only did 
he serve as a director of the U.S. Chess Federation, he also pushed 
wood at every opportunity, though mainly on movie sets between 
scenes. Numerous photographs exist of the great man matching wits 
with the likes of Charles Boyer, Helmet Dantine and, on the set of 
Casablanca, Sydney Greenstreet. 
The games against Greenstreet led to his playing postal chess 
during World War II with several American servicemen in the South 
Pacific. Here's the story as reported by Fidler in a New York Post 
article of early 1943: 
Humphrey Bogart has started an idea that he hopes will be 
widely accepted. The Warner star is playing long distance 
chess games by mail with boys in the service. It all started 
when a private, then stationed in this country, visited the set 
of Casablanca, still at the Hollywood Theatre when Bogart 
was playing chess with Sydney Greenstreet between scenes. 
The private offered to take on Bogart and a keen rivalry

98 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
developed. When the soldier was transferred to the South 
Pacific, he kept up the game by mail. Since starting the game 
with the soldier, Bogart has taken on several of his buddies by 
mail, playing simultaneously. 
Toast of the Town 
As I was saying, my life in Hollywood changed for the better after 
game one of the Steiner match. Billy Wilder took me to lunch at the 
commissary in Paramount Studios. He was a real chess fan who let 
people know it. As he wrote to Chess Review in 1944, "Just nuts 
about your magazine, but omigosh what are those three dames 
doing on your August-September cover? Please, please." 
At the commissary, Wilder introduced me to several stars, includ­
ing Margaret Sullavan and Edward G. Robinson, who played the 
part of a tough guy by pretending to mow us down with a machine 
gun. Wilder then threw a lavish party in my honor at legendary 
Chasen's Restaurant out on Beverly Boulevard in West Hollywood. 
What a star-studded evening it turned out to be! And indeed, why 
not? Founded in 1936 (it closed on April 1, 1995), Chasen's was 
one of Old Hollywood's most stunning .glamour spots, along with 
the similarly vanished Mocambo, Perino's and Romanoffs. During 
Hollywood's magic quarter century from 1935 to 1960, powerful 
men and golden women frolicked there many an evening (Bob Hope 
once rode a horse into the place! ). To my eye, these gods and god­
desses seemed to glide rather than walk, yet they, who seemed so in­
credibly vital and alive, are now nearly all dead or, even more 
tellingly, confined to wheelchairs and imprisoned in the dreams of 
senility. 
Among those in our dinner party were Sullavan and Robinson, 
plus the likes of Linda Darnell, Louis Hayward, Mitzi Mayfair, 
Gregory Ratoff and so on. I espied Errol Flynn and Bogie seated at 
other tables, both devouring thick steaks. And speaking of steaks, 
although Chasen's was renowned for its traditional American-style 
dishes, it served only perfectly marbled, well-aged beef straight from 
the Argentinean pampas. I selected the specialty of the house, a 
"hobo steak," which was a three-inch think filet migrwn baked in 
salt and then sliced tableside and sauteed in butter. Never was a 
steak more tender, sweet and flavorful-each bite augmented by a 
never ceasing flow of Veuve Clicquot champagne and witty badi­
nage. When Billy Wilder noticed that my "hobo steak" was gone, a 
second order materialized as if from nowhere. The great director 
must have had a prearranged signal with one of the waiters. 
Each of the Hollywood greats in our party gushed over my chess 
play and promised to invite my wife, Nina, and me out on our free

Chapter IX

days. The phone calls never came, which I discovered was typical of 
Hollywood. 
The sole exception was Joe Eisner, a screenwriter whom I knew 
from New York. He and his wife were most attentive, which did not 
sit too well with Wilder. "You don't want to be seen in the company 
of people who earn only $3,500 a week," he scolded. "If you intend 
to make an impression in this town, you better stick with me, Bob 
Hope and Louis Hayward-people who make at least $10,000 a 
week or more!" And there I was thinking all along that $200 a week 
was a fine salary. 
One day, the Paramount publicity department asked me to pose 
with Wallace Beery, whom many believe was the greatest character 
actor of them all. Beery was on the set for a western-Bad 
Bascomb, if memory serves-and was wearing a big cowboy hat. On 
each of his huge thighs sat a scantily clad cowgirl. While the prop 
men were setting up a chess board and pieces, he hollered at me in 
his trademark hoarse, raspy voice, "Hey, kid, this game anything 
like checkers?" 
My match with Steiner wore on, and Billy Wilder again invited 
me to lunch. When I arrived at the studio, he was in his private 
office with a secretary. As he came out to greet me, there was 
lipstick on his mouth. Innocently, I mentioned the adornment, and 
without batting an eyelash, he replied, "Don't you realize that a 
genius can do no wrong?" I'm not sure about that, though no one 
can deny that Wilder was and is a genius. This writer, director, 
producer made movies ranging from the film noir classic, Double 
Indemnity, to the sidesplitting comedy, The Se'Ven-Year Itch. And 
so, we both went to lunch, and the lipstick stayed where it was like 
a medal of honor. 
There came a day when Nina and I made some publicity stills 
with Bob Hope. He was very friendly all through the snapping until 
my wife, who once played a small role in a film he made in Long 
Island City, reminded Hope of an ugly incident in which he treated 
all of the extras most ungraciously. Of course, he denied everything. 
Thanks to Billy Wilder, who was a class act in his roguish way, 
Nina and I got a graduate school education in Hollywood friend­
ships. We were all at dinner one evening, and there must have been 
considerable curiosity about the couple occupying the time and 
table of a Hollywood mega-mogul. As my wife was on her way to 
the ladies room, she was stopped by Joseph Cotten, who was so 
memorably murderous as Uncle Charlie in Alfred Hitchcock's 
Shadow of a Doubt. 
"Nina," Cotten intoned silkily, "do you remember me?"

100 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Nina had played various radio parts on Orson Welles' Mercury 
Theater program. She got to know Agnes Moorehead, Howard da 
Silva and Welles himself. Cotten was, of course, an illustrious mem­
ber of the Mercury Theater group, and he exercised his fine memory 
in recalling my wife. Given that we were with Wilder, he must have 
thought that Nina was married to an "angel" or a producer. When 
she said that I was a chess player, he vanished almost instantly. 
Marxism-Hollywood Style 
One of Herman Steiner's enthusiastic backers was Al Bisno, a gen­
erous supporter of chess who later became president of the Manhat­
tan Chess Club. When I arrived for the match, he immediately 
invited me to his home for some bridge. To my surprise, Chico Marx 
and George Raft were on hand. 
As a bridge player, I wasn't. My great claim to fame was to have 
played for a tenth of a cent per point with Al Horowitz, Sammy 
Reshevsky and occasionally Dr. Emanuel Lasker. This latter worthy, 
who was a GM at the game, used to climb the walls when I was his 
partner. Once I had him tugging at his gray tufts of hair and yelling, 
"Why can't you just play out the hand simply and not give me a 
heart attack? Always making with the combinations! "  
And so, when Chico and George announced that we were playing 
for three cents a point with doubling permitted, I went into 
conference at once with Al Bisno. Big Al told me not to worry on 
two counts. First, he would back me; and secondly, Raft was such 
an unbelievably awful player that he always landed up shelling out 
the dollars. Still better, this famous actor insisted on doubling in 
order to get even-and lost more money in the process. 
Chico Marx was as zany when playing bridge as he was backing 
up Groucho in the movies. He wore the clothes of an Italian immi­
grant, cracked one joke after another and leered ludicrously at you 
with those big pop-eyes. I like to think that he represented 
Marxism-Hollywood style. Tough guy George Raft, who supposed­
ly had Mafia connections, conducted himself like a gentleman. Well­
mannered, gracious, treated us like royalty. My only regret is that I 
never found a pigeon like him back in New York. 
I would not have had to work again.

Chapter X 
'The cf3obby /Fischer I JCnew 
Bobby Fischer. I first met him in 1952, when he was only nine 
years old. Bobby was a blond, fair-complexioned, good-looking 
American boy, who was always dressed in a T-shirt and corduroy 
pants. When we were introduced, I noticed that he never looked up. 
I thought that he had, perhaps, dropped something and was still 
looking for it. But later, when he joined the Manhattan Chess Club, 
I noticed that he still could not make eye contact. He invariably 
attracted attention by tugging at my trousers, which was a prelude 
to a question that also never varied: "Wanna have a game?" 
For an as yet undiscovered reason, most great chess players in 
their early years harbor a burning anger. Bobby was no exception. 
You could literally see the killer instinct in his eyes-how they 
flashed with anger and deep-seated hatred when he lost and how 
they flooded with maniacal glee when he won. In Edward Lasker's 
phrase, Bobby played "chess for blood." Which is to say, for meta­
phorical blood spilled during the symbolic war of chess. Like many 
of the indoor Marxmen at our universities, Bobby was a revolution­
ary and crusader against injustice so long as he did not have to 
shoot anyone and endure the sickening sight of real blood. 
"All psychologists agree," writes Frank Brady in Bobby Fischer, 
Profile of a Prodigy, "that chess provides an outlet for hostile im­
pulses in a non-retaliatory situation." Bobby himself has said that 
he enjoys most the climactic moment when his opponent's ego 
crumbles-when, as he described in My 60 Memorable Games, 
Grandmaster Arthur Bisguier "slumped and . . .  [his) chest collapsed" 
after blundering in their game at the 1963 New York Open. Or, for 
that matter, when it finally dawned on Laszlo Szabo that he would 
not draw the following "dead draw":

Designer Genes 
Everyone knows that Bobby Fischer had a very difficult childhood. 
No father, a harried mother, you name it. Many a night, Regina 
Fischer telephoned me in worry about where Bobby was. She did 
not understand until too late that chess was his savior because it 
helped him to dissipate pent up aggression. 
Whenever Regina came to the Manhattan Chess Club, Bobby al­
ways bolted for the door in embarrassment. Mind you, Bobby was 
never rowdy. Far from it. He behaved well, but when something 
happened with which he couldn't cope, he headed for the hills like a 
spooked horse. Mter one such incident, an elderly club director 
tried the old L. Walter Stephens routine and made an attempt to 
ban Bobby because he was not "properly accoutered." This old 
fuddy-duddy, who imagined that he was still living in the Edward­
ian era, had his glasses focussed on Bobby's T -shirt and corduroys.

104 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
But as a club director myself and as a former U.S. champion, I had 
my eye not on Bobby's blue jeans but on his designer genes and suc­
ceeded in reversing this decision. 
In my role as a pop psychologist, I have always clung to the 
simple-minded idea that to understand an adolescent or adult male 
is to know what came early on. Bobby never had a home life that 
even remotely served a young boy's inner needs, and one suspects 
that the deficiencies he found in his mother were transferred to 
women in general. Certainly, he was always uneasy in the company 
of females. To the best of my knowledge, he never had a girl friend 
until well into adulthood. And considering the handsome hunk that 
he became, the absence of women must have been his choice. After 
all, how many females could resist a predatory yet boyish genius? 
"Bobby's longish face," wrote Harry Markey in a memorable de­
scription that appeared in Chess Life, "is a vertical composition of 
bony segments, grouped around the exclamation mark of a long, 
prominent nose and held in submission by a low forehead. The chin 
is aggressively stubborn. His boyish looks are emphasized by the 
carelessly combed hair, parted on the side." 
How many ladies could resist Bobby? Not many, I wager! 
An Angry Chess God Incarnate 
Fischer played to win even when the tournament score no longer 
demanded it. Moreover, unlike any world champion before him, he 
played to win as Black against even the most dangerous opposition. 
And succeeded repeatedly. 
I first felt the almost physical impact of Fischer's will to win in 
his first U.S. Championship back in 1958. We reached a clearly 
drawn ending, but Fischer continued to play down to skin and 
bones. He was so upset over surrendering a half point to someone 
who had been away from chess for a decade that it just flipped him. 
He even refused to analyze the game afterwards, which was rare 
behavior on his part. But two years later in the 1960 U.S. Cham­
pionship, he threw his arms around me after I defeated his arch-rival 
Sammy Reshevsky. That was Fischer's way of saying, "I'm sorry."

My subject is Bobby Fischer as I knew him, and I do not intend 
to dwell on his achievements beyond providing my reasons for 
believing him to be clearly the strongest player of all time. 
At Fischer's peak in the early 1970s, no one could push pawns 
and pieces with him for more than a few games. In three candidates' 
matches played in 1971, Fischer notched up a score of 18%-2% or 
nearly 90 percent against super-GMs Bent Larsen and Tigran 
Petrosian and strong GM Mark Taimanov. One calculation put his 
performance rating at 2939 for these matches. Against Larsen he 
played chess at a 3060 clip. Fischer tallied 181f2-4% at the 1970 
Palma de Mallorca Interzonal, 15-2 at the 1970 Buenos Aires Inter­
national, 19-3 at the Herceg Novi Five-Minute World Championship 
(Mikhail Tal finished a distant second at 141f2, followed by Viktor 
Korchnoi at 14 and Petrosian at 13%), and a preposterous 2P12-lf2 in 
a strong five-minute event at the Manhattan Chess Club. 
At the time, even the Soviet sports establishment was dumb­
founded. After Fischer posted two picket fences against Taimanov 
and Larsen, Sovietsky Sport could only splutter, "A miracle has 
occurred." In an interview with Boris Ivkov, Tal called Fischer "the

106 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
greatest genius to have descended from the chessic sky." Raymond 
Keene described Fischer as "a kind of angry chess god incarnate . . .  
waging total warfare on the chess board." My friend Miguel Najdorf 
said that Fischer "simply throws the pieces up in the air, and 
somehow they land on the right squares!" My dear departed friend 
Isaac Kashdan opined that "in Fischer's hands a slight theoretical 
advantage is as good as being a Queen ahead." 
As for Fischer himself, he seldom had a good word to say about 
his chess. And that's to his credit in my book. "I am satisfied with 
the result," Fischer observed after winning the Palma Interzonal by 
3% points, "but not with my play." On another occasion, he won a 
tournament by two points and regretted not winning it by four. 
Fischer strode the chess landscape with the abandon of a fam­
ished beast loose among defenseless prey. Not always a pretty sight, 
but the most compelling vision thus far in chess history. 
The Nature of Genius 
Bobby's natural feel for chess reminded me of the gift granted 
another boy to whom fame came early in life. "When Jascha Heifetz 
was little more than a baby," the great cellist Gregor Piatigorsky 
once told me, "he was finishing up in the bathroom with his father, 
who carelessly let the toilet seat drop. Still half asleep, the little 
boy, who was born with perfect pitch, automatically responded, 'B­
flat. "' 
I've always wondered about the nature of genius. And for that 
reason and because Bobby was somehow likable, I worked at know­
ing the lad better. He was most definitely a loner who shunned 
people outside chess-especially journalists-like medieval peasants 
avoided lepers. I came to know him as a man of the highest ethical 
standards. If not parfaitement gentil in his social habits, he was al­
ways a knight sans peur et sans reproche in moral matters. 
Bobby's utter unconcern for money is not well known. Most 
people remember his incessant demands for larger prizes without 
recalling that he turned down millions of dollars in commercial 
endorsements after winning the world championship. He sought 
those larger prizes only because he accepted implicitly the capitalist 
principle that value is what buyers freely bid. The higher the bid, 
the greater the worth of one's calling. Hang the money per se. 
Once, when offered $5 million to play a match, he termed the 
proposal totally inadequate because Muhammed Ali received $10 
million for a mere 60 minutes work. Yet when small, poverty­
stricken chess organizers labored to create good conditions for 
masters, Bobby often sent them "thank you" notes. He also gener-

Chapter X 
107 
ously contributed tens of thousands of dollars to Gamer Ted 
Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God. The maids who cleaned his 
room in Reykjavik, Iceland, during the 1972 world title match can 
attest to Bobby's disregard for dollars. According to Fred Cramer, 
who was with Bobby constantly in those days, the great man left 
money everywhere-in his pajamas, under pillows, under the bed 
and so on. "Such scorn of Mammon," wrote New York Times chess 
columnist Robert Byrne, "would be difficult to equal for a saint." 
Bobby possessed a high sense of loyalty to friends-so long as 
they never acted on his behalf without permission. When he was a 
youngster, I used to take him and my son, Mitch, to see the New 
York Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Bobby enjoyed those 
treats and never forgot them. Years later, when I asked him to play 
for the Manhattan Chess Club team against the arch-rival Marshall 
squad and in the process inquired about his fee, Bobby never hesi­
tated. "I wouldn't charge you anything," he said, "because you're a 
friend." Knowing chess professionals all too well, I was stupefied by 
this reply. 
And so, one Saturday evening Bobby sat down to play IM 
Anthony Saidy in a contest that was later voted by a panel of inter­
national judges to be the second-best game in the first half of 1969. 
During the team match, I spent more time analyzing Bobby's game 
than my own effort against Andy Soltis. And for good reason! 
Bobby played a novel and stunning sacrifice as early as move six. 
When I told him afterward that the sacrifice seemed sound, he re­
plied with his customary clipped objectivity, "No, it was unsound," 
and proceeded to show us why.

Let Sleeping Fischers Lie 
At the 1963 Western Open in Bay City, Michigan, Bobby became in­
volved in a speed chess marathon with Norbert Leopoldi, a local ad­
vertising man and strong master. The two were hard at it by 7 p.m., 
immediately after round four on the second day of the tournament. 
Bobby began by offering pawn and move and later upped the odds 
to pawn and two moves. They continued throughout the night, 
often doubling and redoubling the stakes. By 9 a.m. the following 
morning, Bobby was up $3,500. 
For Bobby, that was the good news. The bad news was that he 
had to rush to his morning tournament game without any rest. Still 
worse, he won that struggle only after a hard endgame grind. By 
now exhausted, he dropped into a chair to play GM Bisguier in the 
sixth round:

Hereabouts Bobby fell asleep at the board, but instead of letting

White plays inaccurately.

The Comeback Trial 
At about the time that I retired to Florida in the early 1970s, I 
began sending Bobby opening analysis to help out in his candidates' 
matches. Of course, he didn't need my advice, but at least I felt 
good. And, perhaps, I did help to reinforce a conclusion that he had 
probably already reached: not to repeat a variation of the Taimanov 
Sicilian that he played in his first match game against Petrosian. 
Meanwhile, I started studying chess again with the object of 
returning to serious competition. Easier said than done. The come­
back trail became a comeback trial. Opening knowledge had ex­
panded geometrically, and in the vernacular of the fight racket, my 
footwork had slowed down. It took me two years to feel a little bet­
ter about my play, and by that time, Bobby was already world 
champion, having defeated Boris Spassky in 1972. 
Unfortunately, Bobby did not live and play happily ever after. He 
fell out with many of his friends and surrendered to religious enthu­
siasms. His good friend Anthony Saidy approached me at one of the 
Lone Pine tournaments and suggested that I call him. "You're an old 
friend," Tony said to me, "and I think he'll be glad to hear from 
you." 
Well, why not. I telephoned Bobby that very day, and we began 
chatting as if it were only yesterday that we spoke. He told me 
about owning a piece of land in Florida and said that he might come 
to visit us one day. When I asked him why he was not playing at 
Lone Pine, he cut short our conversation, though he did take my 
phone number and promised to call. Bobby's reluctance to answer 
my question brought to mind the previous evening when Louis 
Statham, our host at Lone Pine, complained hotly about his lack of 
cooperation. I committed the serious mistake of arguing that one 
had to make allowance for genius. To which Statham replied in­
stantly, "I too am a genius-an inventor-and do not want anyone 
to make allowance for me." 
Back in Florida, I got a call from Bobby concerning a legal ques­
tion about getting his games copyrighted. He suggested that my son 
Mitch, an attorney, might be able to help. But Mitch wanted no part 
of it. Still, Bobby continued to call, usually around 2 a.m., and 
would ask me to call him right back. "You've got more money than

Chapter X 
111 
I," he explained. These nocturnal discussions disturbed my wife, 
but deep inside I hoped to bring him back to chess. Bobby was par­
ticularly interested in my comeback difficulties and clearly under­
stood that he would have to play himself into shape. Hence, as he 
told me, his demand for a long title match. 
Bobby's rational approach to getting back in shape convinced me 
that he would soon play again. Then in 1975, on the occasion of 
Edward Lasker visiting us to celebrate his 90th birthday with a 
party and chess tourney, Bobby called for a chat. A surprised Lasker 
told me that he had been trying to contact Bobby without success. 
A German company, Deutsches Telefunken, had asked Edward to 
prevail on Bobby to play one move a week against a consensus of 
German television viewers. A year earlier, the firm paid Anatoly 
Karpov $10,000 for such a game, and the company wanted to hire 
Bobby for an identical sum. 
When Bobby next called, I told him about the offer. He seemed 
quite pleased but added, "See if they'll pay a little more." Flushed 
with the idea of being the hero who rescued Bobby's professional 
chess life, I spent the better part of the next few months negotiating 
with the Telefunken people. Each time that they upped the ante, 
Bobby's answer was the same, "See if they'll pay a little more." 
Finally, the company offered $40,000. I thought the sum was just 
great because it represented $1,000 a week for two minutes work. 
Bobby, too, seemed pleased. 
But-and with Bobby there was always a "but"-I congratulated 
myself prematurely. For he did a complete about-face. "Do you 
think they'll pay a million?" he asked. After all of the negotiations 
and out of sheer frustration, I couldn't speak. The saddest part was 
that Bobby seemed so reasonable at the start, and suddenly further 
effort was obviously futile. I neither phoned nor returned phone 
calls from Bobby until months later when Viktor Korchnoi came to 
town. 
Viktor visited us for a simultaneous exhibition sponsored by the 
American Savings and Loan of Florida. The simul was a huge suc­
cess, and Viktor proved compelling in a 30-minute television inter­
view that followed. When we were finally alone, this chess giant 
spoke of his desire to play a practice match with Bobby. Frankly, I 
did not encourage him, given my experience. Several months later, 
however, when Viktor and I were having dinner with Edward Lasker 
in New York, the subject came up again. I wanted no part of it, but 
Edward argued that my role would be limited to putting them in 
touch and leaving the rest to fate. On this basis we walked back to 
my Manhattan apartment, and I rang up Bobby. 
Viktor and Bobby appeared to hit it off nicely. They agreed to

112 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
meet in Pasadena the following week. That ended my involvement. 
According to Viktor, he found himself in Pasadena at the appointed 
hour standing on a particularly isolated street corner waiting for 
Bobby. A certain car passed by repeatedly, circling the block. 
Finally, the vehicle stopped in front of him, and as the rear door 
opened, he noticed Bobby crouched on the floor beckoning that he 
enter. 
Nothing came of the meeting, just as nothing came of the million 
dollar match that Svetozar Gligoric assured me would take place in 
Belgrade in 1978. Nothing also came of the many other proposals 
advanced by Florencio Campomanes, Miguel Quinteros and Rafael 
Tudela. They all tried, and they all failed because their efforts were 
doomed from the start. 
My own theory about why Bobby quit chess is based on the 
notion that chess-or rather his personal chess legend as an 
incomparable and undefeated genius-means everything to him. It 
is his raison d'etre-the single support for a very frail ego. "It does 
not matter," wrote Robert Byrne at the time Fischer forfeited the 
FIDE world championship to Karpov, "that Fischer's fear was a 
phantasm, that objectively, Karpov would not have stood the 
slightest chance against Fischer's genius for the game. What cripples 
Fischer is his belief that winning a chess game means crushing his 
opponent's ego and, consequently, the same psychic damage is in 
store for him should he lose." 
How tragic that Bob Byrne hit the Fischer nail squarely on its 
head! *

Chapter XI 
One-on-One with JCasparov 
"One-on-One with Kasparov" was first published in the June 1 983 
issue of Chess Life, nearly 2% years before Gary Kasparov won 
the world chess title from Anatoly Karpov in late 1985. The 
interview itself occurred still earlier at the 1982 Olympiad in 
Lucerne, Switzerland. What follows is a slightly expanded and 
edited version of the original Chess Life article. However, predic­
tions and opinions-both right and wrong-remain unchanged so 
as to preserve the period flavor of the piece. Obviously, the author 
got it right about Kasparov becoming world champion; just as obvi­
ously, the author got it wrong about Kasparov having a "high re­
gard" for Karpov's character. 
I first met Gary Kasparov at the 1980 Olympiad in Malta. Initially, 
he seemed more mature than his scant 17 years (he was born in 
April 1963) would suggest, but his energy and enthusiasm were 
unmistakably those of a teenager. 
By the time of our Malta meeting, I had already studied several of 
Kasparov's early games and was convinced that here was one of the 
truly great chess talents of all time-a player who at an early age 
exhibited the brilliance of Alexander Alekhine tempered by the 
objectivity and endgame genius of Jose Capablanca. And his results 
showed it: U.S.S.R. junior champion at age 12, participant in the 
1978 U.S.S.R. Championship at age 15, winner of the 1979 Banja 
Luka International at age 16, and a grandmaster and World Junior 
champion in 1980 at age 17. 
Do these results mean that Kasparov's talent exceeds that of Paul 
Morphy or Bobby Fischer? Hardly. Fischer was U.S. champion by 
age 14 and a grandmaster at 15. Further, Kasparov had access to 
knowledge and training unavailable before. But I firmly believe that 
no other player at so tender an age has shown the same grasp of 
chess theory, the same depth of imagination in combinative play, 
and the same mastery of endgame technique. 
Where these great talents will lead Kasparov, only time will tell. 
But I am willing to go out on a limb by suggesting that perhaps by 
113

114 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
1984, at the ripe old age of 21, Kasparov will become world cham­
pion. 
How does titleholder Anatoly Karpov feel about the threat? I 
had a chance to talk with him during a walk at Malta. "Do you 
think that Kasparov will be your next challenger?" I asked. 
Karpov thought for only a moment. "He is very talented," the 
champion answered, "but the fact that he is very emotional may 
prove to be a stumbling block." This interesting and incisive 
comment comes from a player whose keen analytical powers and 
evenness of temperament should not be underestimated. However, I 
beg to disagree. Great talent is rarely placid, and chess history is 
littered with players overwhelmed by bubbling genius. 
Two Years Later 
I had a chance for a second talk with Kasparov at the 1982 
Olympiad in Lucerne, Switzerland. We settled down in a corner of 
the huge playing hall, and Kasparov told me how he learned chess at 
age six by watching his parents play. His father recognized the lad's 
talent when Gary solved a chess problem that had puzzled both him 
and Gary's mother, Clara. There followed days filled with chess, and 
he improved rapidly. By age 10, he was studying with the great 
Mikhail Botvinnik. 
Would Gary like to emulate Botvinnik's style? "Not at all ! "  
Kasparov fiercely exclaimed. He prefers the style of the romantic 
Alekhine, his greatest chess hero, to the arid play of Botvinnik. In­
deed, Kasparov has in common with Alekhine a facility for pulling 
off finishing combinations that are even more complicated than the 
middlegame maneuvers preceding them. He says that his most bril­
liant combination was played against Brazil's Jaime Sunye-Neto at 
the 1981 World Junior Team Championship in Graz, Austria.

If Sunye-Neto had instead played 42. K-Rl, Kasparov intended 
the astonishing line, 42 . . . .  BxP! ! 43. PxB RIQ7xP! ! !  44. NxR R­

R-N8, mate. 
42 . . . .  8xP!! 43. Px8 RJQ7xP!! 44. Q-83! 
White finds the best defense. If 44. NxR, Black has 44 .

The threat is 4S . . . .  R/N4-N7.

Kasparov notes that 46. Q-N4 is a better defense, though Black 
still wins after 46 . . . .  P-B4 47. Q-NS (the problem with 47. Q-B8 is 
47 . . . .  R-R8ch 48. K-B2 N-Q7! )  47 . . . .  P-BS ! 48. Q-N4 N-Q7ch! !  49.

Kasparov gives the line, 48. N-N3 R-R7ch 49. K-Kl N-B6ch SO. K­
Bl RxB, and says that White's cause is hopeless. 
And what about Kasparov's activities outside chess? It turns out 
that this young man entertains a wide range of interests. He loves 
almost all sports, and he looks as if he is good at many. His favorite 
hobby is travelling around the countryside on his motorcycle. And 
what about girls and marriage? "Girls are wonderful," he confided, 
"but I have a long time before I can think of marriage." 
Kasparov's full schedule at the university, where he specializes in 
English, does not leave him much spare time. He does manage to do 
some reading, and his preference is for historical novels. 
As for current ambitions, Kasparov says he will be content with 
playing in the candidates' matches. And if he is lucky enough to 
meet Karpov in 1984, he will prepare diligently. Kasparov has a high 
regard for the champion's play as well as for the champion's charac­
ter. And character, Kasparov believes, is just as important as ability, 
particularly in a match. 
The time seemed right to confront Kasparov with the assessment 
of him that Karpov offered two years earlier. "Karpov thinks you are 
very emotional," I said. "He told me so himself in Malta. Won't your 
emotions hinder you in match play?" 
Kasparov's face lit up in its usual mischievous grin. His reply was

116 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
brief and to the point. "It is necessary to have emotions," he said. 
To the Manner Born 
Does Kasparov find it a burden to be a celebrity at such an early 
age? "Not at all," he claims. "I manage to do all the things that I 
want to do. And besides, I like people." As we talked, people came 
up from time to time and asked for his autograph. He never refused 
and never lost his composure, always appearing courteous and 
pleasant as if to the manner born. 
"Of all your games," I asked, "which are your favorites?" Kas­
parov astonished me by naming two little-known contests, Alburt­
Kasparov and Kasparov-Palatnik, played in 1978 in a qualifying 
tournament for that year's U.S.S.R. Championship. "But what about 
your games this year at Bugojno against Najdorf and Petrosian?" I 
asked. "The game against Petrosian was great. You tied his hands be­
hind his back, started throwing darts and never stopped. It was bril­
liant! Petrosian never had a chance to get untied." Kasparov laughed 
delightedly. "Yes," he said, "that's a perfect description."

Still, I couldn't convince Kasparov that the Petrosian game ought 
to belong in his personal pantheon. "I have other reasons," he said,

Chapter XI 
117 
"for preferring the Alburt and Palatnik games. They stand out as 
turning points in my career." Kasparov was only 15 when the games 
were played, and he was competing for a chance to move from 
junior tournaments into the adult world of the U.S.S.R. Champion­
ship. Too, the championship qualifier contained some of the best 
talent in the world. The great David Bronstein, for example, finished 
in a tie for 29th-47th in the 64-player field. Kasparov tied for first 
with Igor Ivanov, who now lives in the United States. 
After returning from the Olympiad in Switzerland, I reviewed the 
Alburt and Palatnik games. They exhibit imagination and illustrate 
Kasparov's tremendous vision. He obviously sees clearly the upshot 
of complex positions even before they occur. Most of all, the wins 
over Lev Alburt and Semyon Palatnik show the stamp of an enthu­
siastic chess spirit that is much like the man himself. Here they are 
with a few of my notes:

Chapter XI I 
$ine ©istinctions 
I first met Reuben Fine over 60 years ago and first played him in the 
Junior Masters Tournament of 1930. Although I don't remember 
who won our game, I will never forget the first prize in that tourna­
ment: a barrel of schmaltz herring. (This unique incentive may ex­
plain why Arthur Dake played so well to win the event-the herring 
being a foretaste of the green grapes that served as his diet during 
the deep Depression years to come.) 
Born in 1914, Reuben was a small, blond, blue-eyed youngster 
about six months my junior. He seemed cocky and aloof to some 
people, but I believe that was only a protective facade typical of 
overly sensitive lads. In fact, he was always ready for a spoof. One 
memorable evening back in 1932, he showed up at a Marshall Chess 
Club simultaneous disguised in movie-serial garb as Zu-Ux, a Martian 
invader. Two "Nubian slaves" stood nearby to protect their "mas­
ter." In a sentence, Reuben was a poor boy and a good sport who 
grew up in the East Bronx, and anyone familiar with social condi­
tions in those precincts during the Great Depression knows what a 
difficult time he had just to survive. 
Young Fine possessed a superior intelligence, graduating from 
college at the age of 18. We all knew that he was going to make it 
one way or another. The only questions were when, where, and in 
what field of endeavor. By the mid-1930s, the field of endeavor 
appeared to be chess. I regarded him as our best hope to become 
world champion. 
In a period of only 18 months, from June 1936 to December 
193 7, Fine achieved results in the international arena exceeded 
among Americans only by Paul Morphy and Bobby Fischer. He took 
first prize in 10 of 14 tournaments, including a skein of nine firsts in 
10 events. In two other tournaments, he finished second. At the 
super-strong Nottingham 1936 and Semmering-Baden 1937, he 
went undefeated and finished just below the top both times. He was 
now repeatedly finishing ahead of Alexander Alekhine. Then, on 
Reuben's next visit to Europe, he tied with Paul Keres for first place 
at AVRO 1938, which was the strongest tournament held until that 
120

121 
time and, for those of us who suspect that FIDE ratings have 
become outrageously inflated, the strongest tournament ever. "Both 
his sporting results in the 'thirties and the sheer quality of his 
games," wrote Wolfgang Heidenfeld in Draw!, "make . . .  [Fine) one of 
the outstanding players-possibly the outstanding player of the 
period." 
Reuben was, then, a great player, but paradoxically, not good 
enough. During the mad and bad years of the 1930s and 1940s-the 
era of Stalin, Hitler, Hirohito, and bread lines-no American could 
hope to make a career in chess unless he were world champion or, 
at the very least, U.S. champion. Reuben ran up a narrow plus-score 
against Alekhine but could not arrange a match; and in the U.S. 
Championships of those years . . .  
Fine Versus Reshevsky 
If Fine eclipsed Sammy Reshevsky in the international arena and 
finished ahead of him in several U.S. Opens, he failed to win the U.S. 
Championship in four attempts, trailing behind Reshevsky in three 
of them. I must take some responsibility for my good friend's dis­
comfiture. In the 1936 and 1940 championship fixtures, Sammy 
defeated me and Fine only drew. If the results had been reversed, 
Fine would have finished first equal in 1936 and won outright in 
1940. Then, in the 1944 U.S. Championship (without Reshevsky), I 
beat Fine in the decisive encounter. 
Although Reshevsky outscored Fine on a number of occasions, I 
considered the latter the better player because of his greater 
knowledge and deeper understanding of the game. It showed in his 
superior international record. Fine lacked only Reshevsky's bulldog 
tenacity and singleness of purpose. What Viscount Melbourne said of 
Lord Macaulay-that he wished he were "as cocksure of anything as 
Tom Macaulay is of everything"-defined the distinction between 
Fine and Reshevsky. If Reshevsky's religious beliefs were so strong 
that he never doubted anything, Fine questioned everything. That 
included, I believe, his right to devote so much time to what many 
people regarded as a frivolous pursuit that contributed little to the 
well-being of society. 
Doubts are always the enemy of blind dedication, which is so 
essential for aspiring world champions. Unemployed from 1939 to 
1941, Fine saw that a future dedicated to chess was bleak at best, 
and he obeyed the dictates of common sense, returning to school in 
the mid-1940s and earning a psychology doctorate in 1948 from 
U.C.L.A. During World War II, he worked first as a translator 
(Dutch, French, German, Italian, Yiddish, you name it! )  and then 
for the Department of the Navy as part of a team to determine

122 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
where German U-Boats were most likely to surface. Later, he did 
research in the area of psychological warfare, including a study on 
kamikaze attacks. 
In the field of Freudian psychology, Fine became a giant, serving 
as an honored visiting professor at his old alma mater, the City 
College of New York (Class of '32), not to mention stints in the 
same capacity at the University of Amsterdam, the Lowell Institute 
of Technology, and the University of Florence in Italy. Founder of 
the Creative Living Center, located in midtown Manhattan, he 
authored The History of Psychoanalysis, a standard work in the 
field that was first published in 1979. Among Reuben's 16 non-chess 
books, important titles include Freud: a Critical Re-evaluation of 
his Theories (1962), The Healing of the Mind (1971), The Develop­
ment of Freud's Thought (1973), The Meaning of Love in Human 
Experience (1985), and The Forgotten Man: Understanding the 
Male Psyche (1987). 
But as I was saying about Fine and Reshevsky, when playing over 
their games from the U.S. Opens and the U.S. Championships of the 
1930s and 1940s, I noticed a tiny distinction between the two . 
Fine, who never had trouble focusing his attention in high-profile in­
ternational events, occasionally lost tactical control of middlegame 
positions in domestic tournaments, whereas Reshevsky virtually 
never suffered such accidents. Sammy's bad positions came from 
poorly played openings. I believe that in American events, Fine 
often found himself wondering why he was playing chess for pennies 
and let his mind wander. Take, for example, the following forgotten 
game against a non-master:

strongest grandmasters. 
In spite of lapses, Reuben Fine was a great player who compiled a 
stunning international record. The comparison may not have been

made before, but I think that Fine played a lot like Bobby Fischer. 
Both were active positional players who possessed universal styles, 
and both won games in a variety of ways. "My chief objective," Fine 
once wrote, "was always precision, wherever that would take me." 
As Savielly Tartakower noted, Fine could make "something out of 
nothing" a la Capablanca. But he could also play grandiose and 
risky attacking combinations:

Against Mikhail Botvinnik, Fine played a game that reminds me 
of Fischer's win over Tigran Petrosian in game seven of their 1971 
candidates' match. Notice Fine's excellent opening preparation, easy 
negotiation of complications to achieve relevant positional aims, 
and final penetration with the Rooks.

Dutch Treat 
To support himself, Reuben or Ruby, as we called him, began to 
write chess books. And lots of them. Some of these books such as 
Basic Chess Endings, Modern Chess Openings (sixth edition) and 
Dr. Lasker's Chess Career (with Fred Reinfeld) became classics; 
others suffered the critical ravages of time. Most of his books sold 
well, and along with Reinfeld, he was the most popular chess writer 
of his time. A well-deserved popularity, too. He wrote clearly and 
concisely, and beginners bought his books by the thousands.

Chapter XII

For a time, Ruby lived in Holland, serving as Max Euwe's second 
in the 193 7 return match against Alekhine. Ruby became fast 
friends with Emma Thea Keesing, the daughter of his Dutch pub­
lisher. After a brief courtship, they were married on September 1 ,  
1937; and Ruby brought his bride home to Kew Gardens, New 
York, where according to my old address book they lived at 115-25 
84th Avenue. 
Emmy was a bright, dark-eyed, dainty beauty with a pixieish 
sense of humor that made men love her. A former reporter with 
Amsterdam's Het Volk, she was a real Dutch treat. My wife, Nina, 
and I were fond of her, and since the Fines were neighbors, we 
socialized together. In those days, both my wife and I worked; and 
I was sort of a big shot by virtue of owning a brand new Plymouth. 
Price: $540. How natural, therefore, for all of us-sans Emmy, who 
was a diabetic and decided she could not make the trip-to drive 
down to the Jersey shore for a weekend at Bradley Beach, where we 
rented rooms and rushed out to the waiting sand. 
The day was beautiful, and Ruby and I soon fell fast asleep on 
the beach. Suddenly, we were awakened by loud voices coming 
from the water's edge. My wife, looking bedraggled, was arguing 
with a lifeguard. We arrived on the scene just in time to see a 
policeman load Nina into a paddy wagon. The lifeguard claimed 
that she swam out beyond the ropes and told him to get lost when 
he went out to get her. He then tried to tow her back by the hair, 
and she kicked and cursed at him. And so off Nina went to the 
police station, where we were told the judge would hold a speedy 
trial. 
Ruby and I dashed back to our rooms, dressed in a flash and 
arrived at the police station to find Nina playing gin rummy with 
the chief. The judge was on the way after postponing his weekend 
hunting trip, and we soon found ourselves in the adjoining 
courtroom. I acted as my wife's attorney, and Ruby claimed to 
represent the New York Times. 
The lifeguard told his story, after which I put my "client" on the 
stand. "Tell me," I asked, "did you use foul language toward this 
gentleman when he tried to pull you out of the water?" Innocently, 
this sweet young thing, who once posed for Charles Dana Gibson, 
looked at the judge and answered, "Your honor, such language is 
foreign to my nature." That might have been enough, but I thought 
it fitting that Ruby make the final move. "Your honor," I said, "we 
have here Mr. Reuben Fine, a staff member of the New York Times, 
who saw everything. I don't think it will benefit your fair city if 
word leaks out that local lifeguards deal so harshly with the public." 
Down came the judge's gavel with a bang. Case dismissed!

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
With a Friend Like Me 
In the early years of our chess careers, Ruby and I played a match 
for the then huge sum of .$50, which was put up by James Newman. 
My opponent got off to a flying start by winning the first two 
games, and all he needed was a third win to finish the match. But 
there followed two draws, and I won the rest to take the .$50. 
I think that this match put a hex on Ruby-the same kind of 
Indian sign that Sammy Reshevsky had on me until I beat him two­
zip in a training match for the 1948 world championship tourna­
ment. I had a facility for drawing with Ruby and losing to Sammy 
in U.S. Championships and, in the process, wreaking havoc on the 
former's career plans. That was why Ruby inscribed my copy of his 
Basic Chess Endings with the request to "Please look this over be­
fore playing Reshevsky." 
One moment that I will never forget is when we drove home after 
I won the 1944 U.S. Championship-in large part because of 
defeating Ruby in our individual game. "You know," he said with­
out bitterness, "you've always stood in my way." He was right, and 
the thought saddened me. The phrase, "With a friend like me," 
came to mind. 
My wife was genuinely fond of Ruby, and unlike myself, she was 
in no kind of competition with him. After he and Emmy got 
divorced in 1944, Nina could not bear to see him so depressed and 
often invited him to dinner, where she tried to fix him up with 
dates. He eventually recovered and married Sonya Lebeaux, who 
bore him his only son, Benjamin. 
Sonya figured in a small incident that occurred during my 1946 
match in Hollywood against Herman Steiner. One evening, Ruby 
and his new wife came to see us play. When the game was over, he 
and I wandered off discussing its manifold and recondite complica­
tions, never realizing that we left his wife waiting outside the 
playing room. Luckily, she was still there when we doubled back 
some 40 minutes later. 
How's that for a couple of absentminded professors? 
On January 25, 1993, Ruby entered St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical 
Center in Manhattan. He had suffered a stroke, and on March 26, he 
died from pneumonia. The loss of this old friend, an uncrowned 
world champion if ever there was one, haunts the (very) few of us 
who remain from the glory days of the 1930s, when the United 
States, radiant victor in four consecutive Olympiads, ruled the roost 
of world chess.

Chapter XI I I  
'fhe fittle cBig Man of Chess 
Nothing is more responsible for the good old days than a bad mem­
ory. I know that. But I still say that 1934-the year Adolf Hitler 
consolidated power, the year Joseph Stalin ordered a law to exe­
cute millions of orphaned children cluttering Soviet cities, and the 
year dry winds stirred up a Dust Bowl in the Middle West-was a 
great year for American chess. What better way to forget one's 
troubles than by playing the royal game? 
The Western Open or, as it later became known, the U.S. Open 
was being held in Chicago at the newly built Lawson YMCA. I 
travelled to Chicago aboard a Greyhound bus and snared one of the 
YMCA's better rooms for a dollar a night. There were some 75-cent 
rooms, but I always liked going first class. As Evalyn Walsh McLean, 
a fabulously wealthy Washington socialite of the period, put the 
matter, "My own preference, generally, is for show." 
Little did I realize that Sammy Reshevsky, the famous Wunder­
kind of the early 1920s, would also be at the tournament. Although 
only 22 or 23 at the time, he was emerging from semi-retirement, 
having devoted the previous few years to studying accounting under 
the watchful eye of Julius Rosenwald, his benefactor. Lest you fail 
to recognize this name, Rosenwald was at that time the head of 
Sears & Roebuck. 
Before meeting Sammy in Chicago, I had only seen pictures of 
him in the American Chess Bulletin-pictures in which he was 
playing a simultaneous against 20 U.S. congressmen or posing with 
Edward Lasker and Geza Maroczy. He appeared to be a cute little 
boy with ringlets, a sailor's suit and high-button shoes. Imagine my 
surprise, therefore, when I shook hands with a rapidly balding and 
shy young man who had the most delicate features that I had ever 
seen. As the tournament draw would have it, we played early on; 
and I felt sure of victory until Sammy essayed one of his now 
famous Knight maneuvers. He proved that my optimism was totally 
unwarranted, and the game ended in a draw. 
I did not know then, but learned later, that Sammy handled 
Knights like David Janowski shifted Bishops or Geza Maroczy

Sammy's facility with Knights was no mystery. Indeed, it was an 
expression of his greatest chess strength-the ability to calculate 
tactics like an adding machine. "Technically," wrote Reuben Fine in 
The World's Great Chess Games, "Reshevsky is characterized above 
all by superb tactical skill . . . .  Unlike [Mikhail] Botvinnik he is little 
concerned with the strategical backbone of the game. What he cares 
about are tactical combinations, and these he handles to perfec­
tion." 
Fine's description, which runs counter to the popular notion of 
Sammy as a positional player, is instantly recognizable to those of 
us who had to play this pocket-sized computer. The discrepancy 
between the common and insider views has its source in how 
Sammy applied his tactical genius. If Mikhail Tal used his talent to 
attack enemy Kings, Sammy exercised his ingenuity to find unlikely 
defenses or win difficult endings. His games had the appearance of 
positional chess but not the substance. The following "positional" 
game is a case in point-a struggle in which Sammy spends his time 
not weighing positional abstractions but wending his way through a 
maze of lengthy exchanging combinations:

Bowser on My Trousers 
Playing a chess game with Sammy Reshevsky was like trying to 
shake off a pitbull that clamped its teeth on the leg of your trousers. 
No matter how you thrashed your leg or chess pieces about, he 
would not let go. During the 1930s and 1940s, I was +0 -4 against 
him in U.S. Championship play. No one was tougher on me, and at 
one time or another, I fought 'em all. 
Our game in the 1936 U.S. Championship was typical of what he 
did to me and, for that matter, to almost everyone else. Before the 
tournament, Al Horowitz and I worked out some interesting pawn-

136 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
sacrifice variations in the Tarrasch Defense, one of which I sprang on 
Sammy. He could never resist a pawn, trusting in brute calculation 
to negotiate the hazards. Before long, I had a far superior position, 
but Sammy did not collapse. He hung tough, held his game to­
gether, and put me away with a pretty combination the moment 
my guard came down. And he did all of this with only seconds on 
the clock. Such was my admiration for Sammy's performance that I 
included the loss in If You Must Play Chess, a collection of my best 
games.

Black is beautifully developed, and White is bent double. His 
Queen Knight does not have a single move. Given that White was 
also in severe time pressure, he appeared to have an impossible task 
ahead. But as I wrote about my opponent, "In those days we did 
not realize that his greatest asset is a diabolical ability to save him­
self in harrowing time pressure in even the most delicate positions."

Devastatingly Funny 
At the 1942 U.S. Championship, my relations with Sammy hit a

138 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
snag because of the funniest and most devastating game that we ever 
played. We met in round six, when my score stood at 4%-lf2. Our 
game was crucial. In the position below, I played 45 . . . .  R-NS: 
Sammy Reshevsky-Arnofd Denker 
U.S. Championship, I 942 
Not only can I draw easily with lateral checks, Sammy's flag had 
fallen. At least 40 to 50 spectators saw it drop. Whereupon, tourna­
ment director L. Walter Stephens rushed to our table, picked up the 
clock from behind, and turned it around so that Sammy's clock was 
now on my side. He instantly declared me forfeited. I appealed to 
Sammy, who would only say that he was not the tournament direc­
tor. Then, along with several spectators, I appealed to Stephens. 
But to no avail. He announced archly, "Does Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis ever reverse himself?" The reference was to Judge Landis, the 
commissioner of baseball installed after the White/Black Sox scandal 
of 1919, who was renowned for ruling with an iron fist. 
In the early part of 1948, a second incident occurred that tested 
our friendship. Sammy was preparing for the world championship 
tournament of that year to determine a successor to the deceased 
Alekhine, and I agreed to a training match on condition that we 
played no more than three games a week. Sammy stipulated that 
the games not be published. In game one I caught my opponent in a 
prepared variation of the Two Knights Defense, weathered a fierce 
counterattack and hung on to win. Frankly, I astonished myself by 
breaking Sammy's jinx. The next game was a Gruenfeld Defense in 
which I flatly outplayed my fearsome opponent. A unique event in 
the many encounters between us. 
I was leading 2-0! At which point, New York Post chess colum­
nist Horace Bigelow published the first game. Although I had abso­
lutely nothing to do with this breach of trust and, for the record, 
have published neither game to this very day, Sammy blamed me 
and refused to continue the match. Such behavior on his part was 
most unusual, as he had hitherto honored all of his commitments. 
Because Sammy is no longer with us, I feel released from my non-

Unfortunately, the scoresheet is indecipherable after move 45. 
The second storm in our personal relations passed. Sammy's 
chess stature was too immense and the episode too minor for him 
to remain angry. And while on the subject of Sammy's stature, both 
Al Horowitz and Bobby Fischer believed that in a title match, he 
would have beaten Mikhail Botvinnik during the early and mid-
1950s. Wrote Bobby on one occasion, "For a period of ten years­
between 1946 and 1956-Reshevsky was probably the best chess 
player in the world. I feel sure that had he played a match with 
Botvinnik during that time, he would have won." As for myself, I 
cannot say who would have won such a match, but I can say who 
did win a short match between the two in 1955. Sammy triumphed 
2%-1lf2. Like the great Capablanca, Sammy was lazy, rarely studied 
openings or prepared for specific opponents; but also like the im­
mortal Cuban, he more than held his own with the giants of the 
time by relying on his natural gifts-in Sammy's case, gifts for calcu­
lating defensive tactics and endgame variations. 
By the time Sammy turned 80 in 1991, he was long past his best 
years. Yet this seven-time U.S. champion was still the little big man 
of chess and remained too hot to handle for many players. Just take 
a look at some of his nice wins from recent events. Or take a look at 
the following dour squeeze from a half century past. Mind you, it is 
not one of Sammy's great technical efforts (for one of those, see his 
victory over Fischer in the first game of their 1961 match) but a 
hardscrabble affair that provides a fair idea of what we had to face 
on a normal day.

Strictly Kosher 
Chapter XIII 
143 
Over the years, my wife, Nina, and I grew increasingly fond of 
Sammy and his wife Norma. We respected Sammy's strong religious 
feelings, and on many a Saturday, when he was not allowed to use 
mechanical transport, I walked him home from the Manhattan 
Chess Club down to his apartment at about 12th and Madison. My 
wife and I often went to dinner with him and observed how he 
cross-examined restaurant owners as well as chefs to assure himself 
that the food would be strictly kosher. During tournaments, he of­
ten travelled great distances in order to observe the Jewish Sabbath. 
The above, and much more, I have seen. But not until the 
U.S.A.-U.S.S.R match of 1946 did I watch him starve himself rather 
than eat unkosher food. We were staying in Stockholm, and had it 
not been for my wife, I think he might have become very ill. Nina 
spoke to a hotel maid in Yiddish and managed to strike a responsive 
chord. Sammy was soon served two hard-boiled eggs, toast and 
tea-and all in glass dishes. It was the first food he had tasted in 
nearly three days. 
For many people, the strict observation of rituals in their respec­
tive churches presents problems. But not for Sammy. Never did I 
hear him complain about hardships during a tournament. Never did 
I hear him complain about his lot when Norma became violently ill. 
He simply accepted the situation and took excellent care of her. If 
that's what religion did for Sammy, then more of us ought to give it 
a chance. 
Sammy has gone to his God now, having passed away from a 
heart attack on April 4, 1992.

Chapter XIV 
''Ifim an Officer of the Czar!" 
If you were looking for someone to play the role of a Russian gen­
eral in "His Imperial Majesty's Army" and if Emil Jannings or Erich 
von Stroheim were unavailable, then you could not have done bet­
ter than hire Alexander Alexandrovich Alekhine. Chess champion of 
the world from 1927 to 1935 and from 1937 to 1946, he com­
manded every bit of attention that his imposing name suggests. 
By birth the son of a landowning Marshal of Nobility (his father 
was privy councillor to the conservative Fourth Duma), Alekhine 
created the impression in his bearing and attitude of royal power 
progressively collapsing into total decadence. Having arrived in the 
West in 1921, this dispossessed nobleman was blond in hair and fair 
in complexion, cruelly handsome, and always ramrod straight­
thanks largely to a corset that he was seldom without. Given to 
wearing suits with striped pants and shirts with old-fashioned wing 
collars, he looked like a diplomat on his way to present credentials 
at the Court of St. James. 
I got my first peek at Alekhine in 1929 during a simultaneous ex­
hibition that he gave at the Manhattan Chess Club. My good friend 
Irving Kandel was lucky enough to procure a board and kind 
enough to let me join him in consultation. I can still see Alekhine's 
famous piercing look when approaching a board for the first time. 
He stared at you as if his eyes were snapping your picture. Months 
later, when I again played against him in a simul at the Hungaria 
International Chess Club, he repeated the same procedure, only this 
time he stopped aod said, "Oh, you again." Both games were drawn. 
The following afternoon (or was it the following year?), Alekhine 
played a 20-board blindfold simultaneous at the Manhattan. Al­
though not a record-setter, it was the greatest such exhibition that I 
have ever seen or read about. Just imagine, the man played 20 top 
masters, some in consultation, scored well and produced some 
beautiful games. 
Alekhine's memory was legendary. Just as those eyes photo­
graphed your image and that brain effortlessly conducted huge 
blindfold exhibitioos, so his memory stored all that passed before it.

Chapter XN 
149 
My friend Mendel Najdorf claims that during the Margate tourna­
ment of 1938, he mentioned to Alekhine that they had crossed 
swords 11 years earlier in a simultaneous in Warsaw, Poland. 
"I won our game," said Najdorf. 
"So, you're the one who gave me the Rook," replied the world 
champion who played blindfolded against Najdorf. 
A Chess Superman 
In 1932, Alekhine returned to New York and stayed for several 
months. But this time he was no longer the fastidious, yet vibrant 
powerhouse of 1929. Gone was the regal bearing and that fresh, 
young and eager look. He smoked incessantly and was careless 
about dropping ashes on his clothes. Something had happened, and 
my guess is that chess success and public adulation failed to satisfy 
his restless nature. In a newspaper interview from 1944, he said, "If, 
sometime, I write my memoirs-which is very possible-people will 
realize that chess has been a minor factor in my life. It gave me the 
opportunity to further an ambition and at the same time convinced 
me of the futility of the ambition." Or as the composer, Felix Men­
delssohn, once observed, "Chess is too earnest for a game; too much 
of a game to be earnest about." 
Alekhine still played great chess, though I noticed a certain ner­
vousness and uncertainty in his manner. He came to the Manhattan 
daily, played 10-second chess with us Young Turks and would keep 
us up most of the night because he never wanted to go to bed. 
During this period, he seemed to have no life other than chess, and 
that life appeared to be going to pieces. 
A chess Superman losing his mental pawns? I don't want to ex­
aggerate Alekhine's breakdown. After all, he remained a colossus. 
Take, for example, his famous simultaneous exhibition at the old 
Seventh Regiment Armory on Park and 66th. The event took place 
on election day, November 8, 1932, and pitted Alekhine against 50 
four-man consultation teams made up of most of the top masters on 
the East Coast. A thousand spectators attended, and the opening 
ceremonies featured music from a brass band. Play lasted more than 
12 hours, beginning at 3:30 p.m. and continuing past 4 a.m. the fol­
lowing morning. Alekhine scored a phenomenal +30 -6 =14, eclips­
ing Jose Capablanca's total of +28 -6 =16 of the year before. But 
before Capa-philes lynch me, the other side of the coin is that the 
Cuban finished his exhibition at midnight or four hours earlier than 
Alekhine. By midnight, Alekhine had completed only 10 games! 
The sharp struggle below shows both the quality of opposition 
faced by Alekhine and the brute chess strength that he could exert

tough consultation teams amazed us. Both the Manhattan and 
Marshall chess clubs fielded numerous teams stuffed with masters. 
Other squads came from the Brooklyn Chess Club, the Flatbush 
Chess Club, the Hungaria International Chess Club, the Park Avenue 
Chess Club, the Jewish Morning Journal, the Young Men's Hebrew 
Association, City College, Columbia University, New York Univer­
sity and so on. Members of the teams included Fritz Brieger,

Jack

Rudolph Smirka, Oscar Tenner, this writer and several more 
masters. A young Paul H. Nitze, who would later gain fame as an 
arms negotiator, also played. 
We are often told that if chess is an art, then Alekhine is the 
greatest player ever. He studied chess "eight hours a day on 
principle" and sank himself into what Vladimir Nabokov called its 
"abysmal depths" as no other grandmaster before him. During the 
London Congress of 1922, a chess patron took Capablanca and 
Alekhine to a music hall show. "Capablanca never took his eyes off 
the chorus," testified the patron later, "and Alekhine never looked 
up from his pocket chess set." Certainly, Alekhine consciously 
viewed himself as a chess artist, striving for and achieving aestheti­
cally pleasing effects even in simuls. The following flawed diamond 
was played in an exhibition at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago:

Analyzing with Alekhine 
Alekhine was very nice to me in both personal and chess terms. On 
numerous occasions, he treated me to dinner, which was no small 
deal in the days of the Great Depression. One evening, Bert Kadish, 
a young newspaperman, invited us to a speakeasy housed in a local 
Democratic Party headquarters. Against the backdrop of a huge 
American flag that covered an entire wall, we had dinner. Or at least 
Bert and I did. Alekhine hardly touched his food. Chain smoking 
the entire time, he polished off two bottles of wine. He loved the 
grape, and in keeping with my image of a true Cossack, he could 
hold quite a bit. 
Alekhine chose me as his partner in two consultation games 
against Isaac Kashdan and Richard Warburg (of the banking 
Warburgs). We won the two games fairly easily, but more impor­
tantly, I learned a lot about how the world champion analyzed 
chess positions. Alekhine taught me to sit on my hands and not to 
play the first move that came to mind, no matter how good it 
looked. He examined everything, whipping through an astonishing 
number of variations. When I offered a suggestion, he took it seri­
ously and ran it through the wringer of detailed analysis. And if my 
idea survived this logic-crunching, he cheerfully adopted it. 
"Analyze, analyze, analyze! "  was Alekhine's motto. Moreover, he 
did not confine himself to logical moves. Any move, no matter how 
silly it appeared, merited attention. And not infrequently, he dis­
covered sparkling ideas at the end of seemingly awful continuations. 
My dear friend Arthur Dake, a great American master of the 
1930s, was quite chummy with Alekhine even though Arthur nailed

Chapter XW 
153 
him repeatedly in rapid transit play. Arthur believes that Alekhine's 
distrust of intuitive moves and his penchant for analyzing positions 
to death accounted for his relative weakness in speed games. That 
makes sense because otherwise there is no explanation for how the 
vastly talented Alekhine could perform so poorly in this variety of 
chess. 
An Unhappy Genius 
I am sure that there are plenty of happy geniuses, but Alekhine was 
not one of them. What I saw was a very unhappy man, who drank 
prodigiously and smoked constantly and seemed bent on self­
destruction. 
The excesses that I observed in New York eventually undermined 
Alekhine's practical chess strength. In 1935 he narrowly lost a title 
match to Max Euwe, an upset that no one predicted. To appreciate 
the shock attendant on Alekhine's defeat; one need only examine 
the great man's tournament and Olympiad record from Kecskemet 
in 1927 through the Warsaw Olympiad in 1935. He participated in 
19 events, playing 224 games. Of this number, he won 151, drew 67 
and lost only six. That's about one loss every two years. In a period 
of nine years, he finished second but once in a tournament. 
Alekhine's shock at defeat doubtlessly eclipsed even that of the 
chess world. He suddenly discovered that he loved the world chess 
title more than alcohol and tobacco and dropped both vices until 
after defeating Euwe rather easily in the 193 7 return match. 
We tend to forget that Alekhine was only 45 when he recovered 
his title-a man in early middle age. He needed only to keep 
control of himself to maintain his chess strength for many years to 
come. But he returned to the bottle with a vengeance, though for a 
period his results suffered little. As late as 1943, he could shatter 
tournament fields. I am thinking about his victory at Prague with a 
score of 17-2, which was 2% points ahead of Paul Keres. 
Shortly thereafter, however, Alekhine collapsed as a chess force. 
By late 1944, he could barely defeat a Spanish master, Ramon Rey 
Ardid, in a match; and by 1945, he was routinely drawing and 
losing games against justifiably obscure Spanish and Portuguese 
masters. His play was unrecognizable. 
On March 24, 1946, at age 53, Alekhine was found dead in a 
shabby hotel room in Estoril, Portugal. He choked to death on a 
piece of meat. A police photograph shows a portly, mostly bald old 
man, dressed in an overcoat to keep warm and slumped back in a 
ratty armchair. Today, while staring at this grisly picture, I try in 
vain to recognize the man of martial mien whom I once knew so

154 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
long ago-the displaced Russian noble who used to pound tables 
and proclaim in a thick Russian accent, "I am an officer of the 
czar!"

Jfllexander Jfllekhine 
He paused for just a moment at the top of the stairway leading from 
the airplane-and then all six feet four inches of the man came 
bounding down the steps with the ease of someone half his age. I 
watched in admiration as my 80-year-old friend, still handsome and 
still ramrod straight, took long, purposeful strides across the tarmac 
to the air terminal. 
Dr. Max Euwe, world chess champion from 1935 to 1937, had 
just arrived in Atlanta, Georgia, for the 52nd meeting of the FIDE 
General Assembly. The time was August 1981. 
As Dr. E came through customs, I walked up to him and shook 
his hand. Then we embraced. It was a warm and wonderful reunion 
with a man I had grown very fond of over the years. A kind and 
thoughtful human being, he never permitted himself the luxury of 
losing his temper, always weighing every word carefully lest he give 
offense. 
And while on the subject of words, his own word was his bond. 
Once you had it, you could sleep soundly. 
As Max and I waited for his luggage and chatted about the latest 
news, thoughts from somewhere far back and deep down began to 
surface in my mind. Thoughts from what seemed like another age. 
Thoughts that had nothing to do with sleek and shiny Atlanta 
bathed in warmth and prosperity. Thoughts about early postwar 
Europe and all those sad-eyed people in alleyways handing over 
their few belongings to furtive, sharp-eyed black marketeers for 
food. And, of course, thoughts about my first meeting with Dr. E 
shortly before Christmas in the cold, bombed out London of 1945. 
An Innocent Abroad 
Simply getting to London in December 1945, proved to be a titanic 
struggle. It provided me with my first direct confirmation that all 
was not shipshape in Europe following six years of war. I had been 
155

156 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
invited to play in the annual Hastings fixture over the Christmas 
and New Year's holidays of 1945-46 and in the London "Victory" 
International set to start about two weeks later in mid-January, and 
was desperately attempting to book passage. But to no avail. 
Enter Maurice Wertheim, the immensely wealthy investment 
banker and chess angel, who bankrolled much of American chess 
during the 1940s. Maurice managed to squeeze me into a berth on 
the Queen Mary, which was making its final voyage as a troop 
carrier-a voyage so rough that I clearly remember walking up and 
down hill on heaving decks in a grim battle to stave off seasickness. 
Mter reaching London, I immediately hooked up with Herman 
Steiner, the chess teacher of Hollywood stars, who had arrived first 
aboard one of the old Pan-Am Clippers and who had thoughtfully 
arranged for our rooms at the four-star Savoy. Parking my bags, I 
set off wide-eyed through streets filled with the debris of bombed 
buildings to perform all the chores given me by Mrs. Wertheim, the 
former wife of Gene Seiberling of auto-tire fame. Many of her aunts 
and uncles from Sweden, most of them old and frail, had sat out the 
war in England; and I spent a long day playing the role of Santa 
Claus by dispensing Mrs. W's much-needed medicines and goodies to 
her overjoyed relatives. 
Back at the hotel, I found the following note from Dr. Euwe: 
"Would you and Herman be my guests for dinner this evening? 
Please phone my room if you can make it." 
"Make it?" Was he kidding? Nimzovich himself could not have 
built a blockade that would have kept me from dining with the man 
who beat Alexander Alekhine. 
Amateur World Champion 
Born in a suburb of Amsterdam on May 20, 1901, Machgielis or Max 
Euwe played in his first chess tournament at age 10, a one-day 
event in which he won every game. In 1921, at age 20, he captured 
the first of his 13 Dutch national titles and drew a match with Geza 
Maroczy ( +2 -2 =8), one of the world's leading grandmasters. 
Here, then, was a young comer who would soon be a major con­
tender, right? 
Wrong! Max, you see, discovered a positional law of life that 
every veteran chess master knows all too well: If you expend too 
many tempos on work and love, then your chess development will 
lag. Majoring in mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, Max 
graduated cum laude in 1923, took a teaching position in 1924, 
and earned a doctorate in 1926. Still worse from the chess angle, he

Chapter XV 
157 
acquired a teaching license in bookkeeping, passed an actuarial ex­
amination, took up flying, boxing and swimming, and got married 
in 1926. He eventually fathered three daughters. · 
Although Max competed in some 60 tournaments and contested 
20 matches during the 1920s, most of these competitions were 
small, local affairs. He averaged only one strong tournament a year, 
and he did not garner a major first prize until Hastings 1930-3 1, 
when he finished ahead of Jose Capablanca. Instead, Max made it 
into the pantheon of great masters via the novel route of losing and 
occasionally drawing matches. 
Max's ploy was to select famous opponents, lose narrowly, and 
not become a defeatist. Over his Christmas and New Year's holiday 
of 1926-27, he lost an exhibition match to Alexander Alekhine ( +2 
-3 =5); during the Easter break of 1928 and the Christmas-New 
Year's vacation of 1928-29, he lost two 10-game matches to Efim 
Bogolyubov by a single point each. Then, in 1931, he continued his 
merry ways by dropping a hard-fought match to Capablanca ( +0 -2 
=8), but the following year he beat Rudolf Spielmann and drew 
with Salo Flohr. 
In adversity, Max flourished. He began to make a mark in top­
flight tournament play, thereby becoming a living advertisement for 
Capablanca's claim that one learns more through defeat than 
victory. Following the win at Hastings, he shared second prize at 
Berne 1932 and Zurich 1934, both times behind Alekhine, and then 
finished first equal at Hastings 1934-35, ahead of Capablanca and 
Mikhail Botvinnik. 
As the eventful year of 1935 dawned, and after some 15 years in 
the international arena, Max enjoyed a status among masters rough­
ly equal to that possessed by Alekhine in 1924, after that immortal 
had also spent a decade and a lustrum in top competition. But there 
the similarity ended. For Alekhine was a professional and Euwe an 
amateur. Max's victory in the Olympic Amateur Championship at 
The Hague in 1928 was emblematic of the fact that this world ama­
teur champion was also an amateur world champion-the last 
player who was able to scale the Everest of chess in his spare time. 
And not by luck, either! 
"'The Weakest of World Champions" 
Nothing infuriates me more than to hear Max Euwe described as 
"the weakest of world champions" and as someone who made it to 
the top only because of Alekhine's alcoholism. First of all, the life­
time score between these two rivals is only narrowly in Alekhine's 
favor, 44-38. In addition, Dr. E, who captured 102 first prizes

158 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
during his tournament career, won a half-dozen match games from 
Alekhine that have never been surpassed for their sheer wondrous 
accuracy. Just take a look at game eight of their first match in 
1926-27, or game 20 in 1935, or games one, five, 17 and 29 in 
1937. The latter game, just like the famous Fischer-Keres Ruy at 
Cura9ao 1962, is one of those rare battles in which Black's losing 
move remains unclear to this very day.

Black makes no mistakes his game is always difficult."

Bl. "[Euwe's] best game of the whole series"-Alekhine. 
There can be no doubt that Dr. E was in Alekhine's league. But 
more important than their overall lifetime score and the conduct of

Chapter XV 
159 
individual games is a crucial fact that has never, so far as I know, 
been remarked upon: As late as game 56 in the lifetime competition 
between Alekhine and Euwe, the score was dead even! Only when 
Alekhine won game seven of their second title match did he go 
ahead for keeps. Oh yes, Alekhine never won a tournament game as 
Black against Euwe. 
So, while I cannot deny the intellectual validity of making com­
parisons among the 13 world champions, I can state that it is more 
enlightening to argue about who is the strongest among these 
distinguished chess minds than about who is the weakest. 
Having said that, let me lay my cards on the chess table: While 
Max Euwe was a first-class human being whose friendship I treas­
ured, I never warmed up to his style. It seemed dry and uninspired 
when compared with Alekhine's danger-is-my-business approach. 
None of us realized it at the time, but Euwe's play, for all of its oc­
casional brilliance, was a harbinger of the chess computer. Thus, 
heaven help the player who launched an ill-prepared attack or even 
a well-prepared attack against Euwe! 
What Fred Reinfeld wrote of the following, seldom-published 
game applies to a lot of the chess played between these two giants: 
"In this titanic struggle, Euwe successfully withstands the withering 
fire of a characteristic Alekhine attack. Although Alekhine ulti­
mately succumbs because he tries to force the game at all costs, this 
should by no means minimize our appreciation of Euwe's cool and 
resourceful defensive play in a very trying position."

Winning the World Title 
At Zurich 1934, Euwe defeated Alekhine in a brilliancy prize game 
that ought to have served as a wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee call for 
the world champion and his fawning critics. 
It did not. Alekhine's record was simply too overwhelming for 
anyone to give the young Dutchman much chance to win the title 
match scheduled for late 1935. From Kecskemet in 1927 through 
the Warsaw Olympiad in 1935, Alekhine competed in 19 events, 
played 224 games, won 151, drew 67 and lost only six. That's 
about one loss every two years. Over a period of nine years, he 
missed first prize in precisely one tournament. 
Yet in Max's brilliant win at Zurich one sees the reasons for his 
title victory the following year. Not only did my friend level his 
score with the champion over their previous 12 encounters, he also 
conceived a combination that epitomized his tactical acuity. At the 
time, Alekhine dismissed the brilliancy as a tactical cheapo; later, 
after regaining the title in 1937 (by a score of 15%-9%), he sang 
another tune. "Does the general public, do even our friends the crit­
ics," he wrote, "realize that Euwe virtually never made an unsound 
combination? He may, of course, occasionally fail to take ac­
count . . .  of an opponent's combination, but when he has the initia­
tive in a tactical operation his calculation is . .  .impeccable."

162 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Max employed his tactical genius not to devise original strata­
gems a la Alekhine but to apply general rules accurately to given 
positions. "Euwe as [a] strategist," wrote Alekhine, "stands at the 
opposite pole from where Reti stood. Reti declared in his famous 
book, New Ideas in Chess, that he was interested only in the 
exceptions; Euwe believes, perhaps a little too much, in the immu­
tability of laws." 
All of which means that while Max was not an original player, he 
was certainly a formidable one-a tactical genius who enforced gen­
eral positional laws with the rigor of a trained mathematician. In 
the words of Hans Kmoch, he was "logic personified, a genius of law 
and order." Study the combination below, consider Alekhine's emo­
tional reaction, read Max's dispassionate commentary given in quo­
tation marks, and stop imagining that he was lucky to defeat 
Alekhine +9 -8 =13 in their first title match:

Euwe-A/ekhine 
Zurich, / 934 
"The text is severely criticized by Alekhine on the ground that it 
is based wholly on a tactical finesse. This latter consideration is, 
however, only incidental to the primary strategic significance of the 
text move . . . .  The basic point underlying the text is that the player 
with the greater freedom of action ought to strive to increase his 
mobility by opening up new lines wherever possible . . .  .lt is true that 
at first sight this move seems quite daring and even a contradiction 
of White's plan of the game, for Black obtains the square Q4 for his 
pieces, the QP is isolated and there are possibilities of counterplay 
for Black on the K file . . .  .It will therefore be understood that White 
decided on the text move only after the most searching study of the 
position."

"It is this surprising move which establishes the soundness of 28.

this beautiful combination. For White's 31st move is a loud echo of 
a famous Alekhine brilliancy. Here is how Alekhine defeated M. von

Dinner at Eight 
After returning to my hotel and receiving Max's invitation to dinner, 
I went upstairs to dress for the occasion. For dinner was at eight-at 
the Savoy. And with champagne flowing, what a gala occasion it 
turned out to be. Here was the great Dr. Max Euwe, about whom

164 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Herman and I had read so much, playing the role of polished 
raconteur. 
In answer to one of our questions, Max said, "Alekhine's weak­
ness was that he could not sit on his hands during a game. He had 
to be doing something to satisfy his restless imagination and ap­
pease his forceful personality. What he did was usually brilliant and 
frequently surprising, but for me at least, it was not shocking. My 
practice was to search positions in advance for ideas that Alekhine 
might employ to upset the status quo. Of course, his ideas were no 
less strong even when they were predictable." 
That evening, I must have listened with mouth agape. And even 
Herman, my black-haired Magyar friend who usually dominated 
every occasion by virtue of sheer volume alone, appeared subdued. 
For once, this child of nature controlled his animal exuberance and 
could be found guilty of listening. Though, to be sure, not for long, 
as he soon departed on a date. (Women were everywhere in Her­
man's life, and I have to admit he had excellent taste.) 
As for Dr. E and me, we took an evening stroll and soon got lost 
in one of those Holmesian London fogs that roll in so suddenly. As 
we wandered blindly through streets made unrecognizable by the 
wreckage of war, our conversation got around to the question agi­
tating every chess person just then: What should be done to 
Alekhine for apparently authoring several anti-Semitic articles in the 
Nazi press? 
Max believed that Alekhine had been drinking heavily at the time 
and was coerced by a logic of promises and unpleasant possibilities. 
The unpleasant possibilities did not, however, constitute an excuse. 
And the late Reuben Fine headed up a successful effort in the United 
States to pressure the British organizers of the "Victory" Interna­
tional to withdraw their invitation to Alekhine. 
About a month after our long walk in the fog, near the end of the 
"Victory" International, Dr. Euwe was unanimously elected chair­
man of a players' committee to take up the question of Alekhine's 
alleged collaboration with the Nazis. 
I found myself in anguish. Back in the Depression years of the 
early 1930s, Alekhine lavished me with kindnesses-free dinners, 
superb analysis sessions, instructive practice games and so on. He 
even chose me as his partner in consultation games. This king of 
chess treated a young, unknown player like a prince. He became my 
hero and chessic guiding light. And now, I found myself going along 
with the condemnatory herd, repaying the currency of kindness 
with the coin of unproved accusation. 
To this day, nearly a half century past, I regret that more of us

Chapter XV 
165 
did not act like a certain officer in De Gaulle's Free French army, 
whose parents had been murdered in 1911 at Rostov-on-Don in a 
Ukrainian pogrom. I'm speaking about Dr. Savielly Tartakower, who 
publicly pleaded Alekhine's case and then, facing down the entire 
group, proceeded to take up a collection for the stricken champion, 
who was penniless in Portugal. As Dr. E later wrote, "Tartakower 
was never a 'joiner,' and he hated mass demonstrations." 
I'm not sure how long Max and I stumbled that night through the 
freezing fog. Our adventure, which marked the beginning of a long 
friendship, ended only after we asked a bobby for the way back to 
the Savoy. 
Dr. E, I had discovered, was easy to be around and easy to talk 
with. He also possessed a fascinating quality: He was the first 
grandmaster I had ever met who was genuinely concerned about the 
plight of his fellow masters. Although his years as president of FIDE 
were still only a glimmer far ahead in history's tunnel, he spoke 
passionately about promoting chess worldwide so as to improve the 
lot of grandmasters. 
The Summer of '46 
In 1945 and 1946, I played chess virtually non-stop. Following my 
winter campaign in Hastings and London, I returned to the United 
States to prepare for an upcoming U.S. Championship match against 
Steiner, which was played from May 4 to 18. After winning that 
contest, I launched my summer campaign in Europe, which in­
cluded doing battle at Groningen, Holland, in August and Septem­
ber in the first major tournament after World War II. A few days 
following that event, I departed for Moscow to participate in the 
second U.S.A.-U.S.S.R. Team Match. 
Since I arrived in Amsterdam a week or so before the Groningen 
tournament was to begin, Dr. E invited me to stay at his home, 
where I got to know his wife and three beautiful daughters. Family 
dinners, chess talk and analysis, and old-fashioned socializing filled 
several delightful days until our departure for the tournament. 
In the great Groningen International, Dr. E scored his last major 
triumph, tallying 14-5 to finish only a half point behind Botvinnik 
in a tournament that had all of the world's top players except for 
Reuben Fine, Paul Keres and Samuel Reshevsky. My showing was a 
respectable and deeply disappointing 9%-9lf2, which was good 
enough to share 10th-12th with Alexander Kotov and Dr. Tarta­
kower. I say "disappointing" because in round 11 against Dr. E, I 
experienced the worst mental blackout of my career. Tied for third 
at the time with Vassily Smyslov at 7-3 and having already drawn

tion after move 4 7.

The news was bad. In my absence, Fine and Reshevsky convinced 
Maurice Wertheim, captain of the U.S. team, that they should 
occupy the top boards in the upcoming match against the Soviet

Union. But as U.S. champion, I had a claim to the top board, and as 
I pondered the injustice of this sneaky action, I began to see red. 
Here's the result.

So demoralized was I by this defeat that even though I had 
already drawn as Black with Botvinnik and Smyslov, I managed to 
score only 21j2-S% in the remaining eight rounds. To his credit, Dr. E 
was equally upset about the outcome of the game, especially since 
he had offered a draw a few moves earlier. As for the Soviets, they 
eyed my loss askance, doubtlessly ascribing to us the same motives 
that influenced the outcome of key games among themselves. 
During the Groningen tournament, Dr. E quietly demonstrated 
that he was firmly on the American side in the turbulent early years 
of the Cold War in Europe. He wrote a speech in Dutch for me to 
deliver over radio, and everyone remarked on how well I repre­
sented the United States. 
This tiny success, along with thousands of other little victories, 
were crucial for tamping down anti-Americanism. And speaking of 
anti-Americanism, I will never forget the banquet following the 
Groningen event, when the Swedish player Erik Lundin received a 
round of applause because his country sent a shipload of wheat to 
Holland, while the United States received no similar appreciation, 
even though it was sending far more food and clothing. "The pro­
blem," Dr. E told me, "is that you do not superintend the distri­
bution of your goods, and they land up on the black market." 
Indeed, when my wife was at tea with a Dutch family one after­
noon, the lady of the house found herself without sugar. She 
quickly telephoned her "black-market man," and the sugar (marked 
from America) arrived a few minutes later. 
Max the Mum 
When Max visited New York briefly in mid-1947, I had the oppor­
tunity to repay a few of his many favors. We went on a boat trip 
around Manhattan, and the former world chess champion was as 
pleased as a child by the Statue of Liberty. We dined at Cabana 
Carioca, a lively Brazilian restaurant known for its lightly clad 
dancers and delicious food; and when we went over to the Yorkville 
section of Manhattan on East 86th, Max surprised me by being one

168 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Dutchman who did not drink beer. He also surprised my wife Nina 
by showing up with flowers at the Lenox Hill Hospital just before 
she gave birth to my son Mitchell. I hadn't said peep, but he had his 
quiet ways of finding out. 
Max was quiet in another way. He never discussed his heroism 
during the Nazi occupation. Yet not only did he write letters to 
Alekhine asking the latter to intercede on behalf of the Dutch 
martyrs, Dr. Gerard Oskam and Salo Landau, he also put his life or 
at least his liberty on the line for several others. 
I learned of one instance from Max's friend, Hans Kmoch, the 
famous in-house annotator at AI Horowitz's Chess Review. Hans 
was living at the time on Central Park West somewhere in the 
Eighties. His wife Trudy, a Jew, had constant nightmares about her 
interrogations and beatings in Holland by the Nazis. Hans had little 
money, and Trudy spent much of the day in bed screaming. 
Enter Nina. My wife was working in the New York City welfare 
system and managed to get them part-time assistance. Hans then 
confided in me about how Dr. E greased palms and used his in­
fluence to save Trudy's life by keeping her out of a concentration 
camp. But mind you, I heard this from Hans, not from Dr. E, who 
was always Max the mum about his good deeds. 
Mr. President 
In 1970, Max Euwe was elected president of FIDE, a position he 
held until 1978. His efforts in that post to hold together both 
Fischer-Spassky I in 1972 and Korchnoi-Karpov I in 1978, though 
widely reviled at the time, are universally acclaimed today. He also 
presided over a massive expansion of FIDE from 72 countries to 
106. And no wonder: he visited more than 100 countries as FIDE 
president, tirelessly promoting chess. A journalist fittingly dubbed 
him "The High-Flying Dutchman." 
There is a lot about Max's life in chess that could be discussed at 
great length. As a theorist, he introduced the Scheveningen Varia­
tion of the Sicilian Defense and edited Chess Archives, which 
served for nearly two decades as the pacesetter in opening analysis. 
As an author, he wrote far more voluminously than any other world 
champion, including Alekhine, who published 17 volumes. 
But my subject is Max Euwe as I knew him. 
The years passed, and we met regularly, if briefly, during the 
Olympiads of the 1970s. True, his stuffed schedule precluded re­
peating our leisurely get-togethers of yesteryear; yet when I decided 
to return to competitive chess after an absence of 15 years and was

Chapter XV 
169 
seeking a few invitations to European events, Max got the job done, 
unlike the American representative of the time who pronounced my 
request as undoable. 
Twice during the 1970s I visited Max in Amsterdam. Since he 
had given up teaching in 1957, one might have thought that his life 
had slowed down. Not at all. As president of FIDE and as a 
consultant for various computer companies, his plate was loaded. 
Yet there always seemed to be some space left over for an old friend. 
For most people, work expands to fill the time allotted; but for 
Max, time expanded to complete the work allotted. 
What Max wrote about Savielly Tartakower ought to be said of 
Dr. E himself: "Without men such as he, the chess world would not 
have been nearly what it is. It is not the rules and the precepts 
which make the chess community; it is the individuals." 
Our Final Farewell 
The FIDE Congress in Atlanta was over, and Max and I were back at 
the airport-this time to say good-bye. During his stay in Atlanta, 
he appeared to be more relaxed than I had ever seen him. No longer 
president of FIDE, he had time to reflect at length upon the future 
of chess. He believed that the royal game would soon become a 
required subject in schools throughout the civilized world, and he 
enumerated the many benefits therefrom. He also had high hopes 
for social experiments involving chess that he had initiated in Africa. 
Max radiated optimism and good health. And like all of his other 
friends, I felt bright and important in his presence. As he walked to 
the plane, I noticed the same spring in his step as on arrival. 
Imagine, therefore, my shock when learning of his death from a 
heart attack on November 26, 1981, just three months after what 
turned out to be our final farewell.

Chapter XVI 
fin Offer I Couldn't f\_efuse 
When someone wins a U.S. national championship, he is hit by a 
barrage of unusual business offers. Although my title was for chess, 
which was not one of the more popular pastimes back in 1944, I 
still received numerous offbeat proposals. 
One of the oddest was to become president of the Southern 
Nevada Disposal Service, a beautifully named garbage company. The 
starting salary was munificent, but it was an offer that I both could 
and did refuse after discovering that the company was Mafia 
controlled. 
Another proposal came from a chicken farmer in Toms River, 
New Jersey. He reasoned that anyone with enough brains to be­
come a chess champion could surely find a plan to fatten chickens 
more economically. A dubious idea. Often, I recall Weaver Adams, a 
master who inherited a chicken farm and who was-so to speak-a 
white man clear through. He wrote a book, White to Play and Win, 
lived in a white house on White Street, chewed antacid pills that left 
the inside of his mouth perpetually white, and raised only white 
chickens that laid white eggs. Predictably, Adams' business was soon 
no more than a shell. 
There were other offers and endorsements, plus the usual phony 
land-development schemes. All came to nought. Then, about a year 
later when things had quieted down, I received a phone call from an 
old man named Koback, who owned a pharmacy in Hartford, Con­
necticut. It involved . . .  
An Offer I Couldn't Refuse 
The year was 1946. Mr. Koback read that I was going to Moscow to 
play in a 10-board chess match between the United States and the 
Soviet Union. The Cold War was on, and the U.S. State Department 
hoped to improve relations between "the two super powers" by 
sponsoring this international competition. Mr. Koback suggested 
that we discuss over dinner a matter that "could prove quite 
profitable for the two of us." 
170

Chapter XVI 
171 
We met the following Sunday in New York at Liichow's, a great 
old German restaurant down on East 14th. Koback was a tiny, frail 
man, and he came with his only daughter, a dark-haired, bright­
eyed woman of about 30. He also brought along a thick folder filled 
with pictures, maps and old news clippings that he used to illustrate 
points in his story. 
Koback's family owned the only chemist's shop in Tuapse, a 
small Russian town on the Black Sea. And it was to this small town 
that many Russian nobles fled some 30 years earlier to escape the 
Bolsheviks. The Kobacks collected millions in gold and jewels by 
arranging passage to Turkey for aristocrats and members of the 
haute bourgeoisie. But the Kobacks quite literally had to run for 
their lives when the Communists discovered their trade. They left 
behind a fortune in buried treasure. 
Old Koback showed me on maps where portions of the treasure 
were hidden, and he provided photographs and news clippings of his 
family posing in front of their Tuapse shop. "All these years I was 
hoping for a change in government," he said in a voice made hoarse 
by emphysema, "but I realize now that it is not to be in my 
lifetime. I want my daughter to enjoy some of this wealth." Koback 
claimed that the Soviets were anxious to make 50-50 deals because 
of their dire need for hard currency, and he asked me to represent 
his interests. "Half of all you recover," he concluded, "will be yours, 
and by the most conservative estimate, that should amount to half a 
million dollars." 
My mind began to swim. Half a million bucks, maybe more! Such 
talk occurred only in the movies. I could become rich without 
having to work for it. Here was an offer I couldn't refuse. 
One week later, in August 1946, I was off to Groningen, Holland, 
to play in the first great chess tournament following World War II. 
Most of the top players were there, including the cream of the 
Soviet crop. I planned to play myself into form for the U.S.A.­
U.S.S.R. match scheduled for September. And I made an interesting 
draw with Mikhail Botvinnik, who won the tournament a half point 
ahead of Max Euwe. 
At Groningen, however, my mind was not on chess. All I could 
think about was how to approach the Soviets with my secret. One 
of the "Russian" group was Salo Flohr, the famous Czech star who 
landed up living in Moscow after his country was overrun by the 
Nazis in 1939. 
You do know Grandmaster Flohr, don't you? This delicate and 
diminutive man spoke English and seemed more worldly and 
sophisticated than the other members of his delegation. Although

172 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
only 38 years old at the time, he no longer enjoyed the kind of 
prestige that prompted FIDE in 193 7 to designate him the official 
challenger to Alexander Alekhine. His great tournament victories at 
Hastings 1931, 1933 and 1934, Moscow 1935, Podebrady 1936, 
etc. were only trophies from a better time. Gone from his game was 
the aggressive yet flawless positional play of yesteryear.

At Groningen, Flohr and I talked a lot and became good friends. 
He asked me to call Nina, my wife, who was still in New York, and 
to have her bring a suitcase of goodies for Raisa, his wife. What a 
celebration we had when Nina arrived. It soon seemed natural that I 
should reveal the secret to Salo. To my astonishment, he was not 
even slightly surprised and acted as if the matter were routine. He 
promised to arrange a meeting in Moscow with the relevant govern­
ment people. 
Specialists in Soviet history tell me that this easy intercourse be­
tween one of Stalin's subjects and a Westerner strikes them as unbe­
lievable. Certainly, it was unusual. The explanation is that even the 
Iron Curtain of Stalin had rents here and there-tiny breaches 
through which the dictatorship served its interests. Fortune hunters, 
for example, were tolerated if they were apolitical and if they de­
posited hard currency in Soviet coffers. You scratch my pocket­
book, and I'll scratch yours was the philosophy. 
Mission to Moscow 
On my first day in Moscow, Flohr phoned to say that all had been 
arranged and that he would pick me up the following morning. The 
meeting was held at the Hotel Moskva, where I was introduced to 
two men who looked like my idea of members of the secret police. 
We talked a bit, and they agreed to arrange everything to my 
satisfaction. Money division, no problem. Transportation to Tuapse, 
again no problem. They would provide a private airplane. The only 
problem was how to explain my remaining in Moscow after the 
American team departed.

17 4 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
The next day Salo and his wife arrived early at our hotel with a 
solution. Nina would feign illness and check in at a hospital for 
treatment. And I, as a devoted husband, would stay on. The plan 
seemed very clever, but my wife would have none of it. "They'll 
poison me," she said, "and toss you off the airplane, making it look 
like a good natural death." Such variations occurred all the time 
when Stalin was the Soviet king, and Nina insisted that we select 
instead the variation of leaving with our group. 
What to do? After talking all night, we decided to trust Salo. We 
turned over our maps and offered him half of our share. If all went 
well, we would still make more money than we ever dreamed 
possible. In return, Salo promised to cable us when the treasure was 
or was not recovered. "Met your father in Tuapse" (or the reverse) 
was the simple code. 
Back in New York, while awaiting the cable, I telephoned Mr. 
Koback and related all that happened. He listened quietly, and if he 
was displeased with my handling of the matter, he gave no sign. 
Weeks passed. Then came the cable. It read, "Never met your father 
in Tuapse." I was heartsick and drove all the way to Hartford to 
show Old Koback the message. He seemed less upset than I, which I 
attributed to his illness. As for his daughter, he said that she was off 
visiting some friends. 
Such a sad ending to what promised to be a pot of gold at the 
end of my personal rainbow! Still, I soon got used to the idea of 
working for a living and forgot about the crushing episode. 
Salo's Gold 
Years later, someone told me that Salo got divorced (in truth, his 
first wife died) and was living with a much younger woman, which 
seemed hardly surprising given that divorce was routine in the ci­
devant Soviet Union. But after hearing that he and his lady were 
travelling back and forth to Prague, Czechoslovakia, I became 
curious. Foreign travel was an expensive proposition for Soviet citi­
zens: They had to pay not only their fares but also healthy bribes to 
procure exit visas. Much later I heard a rumor that the two travel­
lers married and moved into Moscow's elegant Ukraina Apartments, 
whereupon my suspicions grew like mushrooms in a hothouse. Was 
Salo's sudden affluence some of my money finally coming out of 
hiding? Surely, a chess instructor could never afford to live at the 
Ukraina among Soviet nomenklaturshchiki. 
I was tortured with doubts for many more years until a Jewish 
refusenik claimed that he saw Salo and wife tooling around Moscow 
in a Nova Zeiss. That was the last straw. I hit the ceiling over Flohr's

Chapter XVI 
175 
duplicity. Unable to sleep, I knew that there would be no peace 
until I confronted him. 
One day in the early 1980s, I cabled Salo with news of my im­
pending arrival in Moscow and asked him to pick me up at the 
airport. But a woman named Elena, who claimed to be his second 
wife, came instead. An attractive, dark-haired woman in her early 
60s, she drove me to their apartment. She explained that Salo was 
away and that we would see him the next day. No surprise, I 
thought, since he lectured all over the country. I slept well that 
night, and after a hearty breakfast, Elena and I set out to meet my 
old confidant. 
On the way she suddenly revealed that Salo had suffered a stroke 
and was resting at a medical facility outside the city. Wild thoughts 
rushed through my mind. Why hadn't she told me sooner? Why? 
Why? Abruptly, she swerved from the main road and drove up to an 
ugly, low building that abutted a much larger one. 
As we entered, a buxom woman clad in slovenly nurse's garb got 
up from a desk and led us down a long, dark and deserted hallway. 
She paused only a moment to unlock the door to a small room 
before returning to her post. The dusty room was nearly bare with 
only a bed and a tiny barred window. There was no closet. The bed 
was so diminutive that it looked more like a child's crib, and on it 
lay someone with a wrinkled neck and gray head with his face 
turned to the wall. Was it the great Grandmaster Flohr, or was 
Elena playing some kind of game? I was frightened and confused, 
not knowing what to think. 
Elena bent over and gently rubbed the person's back. I watched 
raptly as he slowly turned his head and looked up with a totally 
blank expression. A few seconds passed, and Elena whispered in the 
man's ear and motioned for me to come closer. Just as I leaned 
over, he let out the most frightful cries that I have ever heard. He 
was trying to speak, but there emerged only wild screams. The 
scene was so overwhelming that I could not think clearly. Yes, the 
figure in bed resembled Salo, but it was a scaled down version that 
could not have weighed more than 80 pounds. 
The commotion brought with it the bosomy nurse and a hypo­
dermic needle. Soon peace and calm returned. Although no more 
than 15 minutes had elapsed since our arrival, I felt sapped and was 
unable to speak all of the way back to Moscow. 
Entering Salo's apartment, I unabashedly poured myself a tall 
glass of vodka neat, tossed it down, and literally fell into a large 
leather chair, legs splayed and hands draped over its arms. As Elena 
moved to and fro, preparing something to eat, I began to study her

176 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
more closely, nagged by the feeling that we had met somewhere 
long ago. 
Salo's uwife" 
Elena must have read my mind. She said, "You still don't recognize 
me." I confessed that she was right and then said that there was 
something familiar about her. "I must have gained too much 
weight," she replied with a smile, "for you to recognize Koback's 
daughter! "  My jaw dropped. I could see a slight resemblance, but I 
could not imagine what she would be doing in Moscow. And that's 
when her story came pouring out. 
After I returned to the United States in 1946 and brought Elena's 
father the bad news, the old man sent his daughter to Moscow to 
check out my story. She met Salo at one of his chess lectures, and it 
was love at first sight. She said they later married and lived happily 
until Salo's stroke. 
"That's all well and good," I interrupted, "but what about my 
money?" 
"There was no money," she answered. 
"Then where did you get the money to live so well?" I flashed 
back in the bottom-line spirit that her bare assertion was not 
necessarily the naked truth. 
Elena walked across the living room and reached into a drawer of 
a china cupboard. She removed a very official looking document 
and handed it to me. "This is the last will and testament of Salo's 
father," she said, "who was one of the richest men in Czechoslo­
vakia. It was he who left us all that money, which is why we were 
constantly travelling to Prague. I suspected that you felt cheated, 
but I knew it would have been useless to protest our innocence. 
You had to come and learn the truth for yourself. Just imagine your 
suspicions if I had wired that you could save yourself a lot of bother 
because Salo was too ill to see you." 
Salo's Father 
On the flight back to New York, I was haunted by my thoughts. 
What a way to pause at life's exit! And, too, I was saddened by my 
distrust of Salo and Elena. She was correct-! had had to see for 
myself. 
That's when the first bombshell dropped. In Florida, word 
reached me that Salo staged a remarkable recovery and that he and 
Elena moved to Prague where he died some months later. (In fact, 
he died in Moscow.) But the real blockbuster was the second bomb-

Chapter XVI 
177 
shell, and it dropped only when I received an issue of a Russian 
chess magazine devoted to the late Grandmaster Flohr. There were 
several of his best games, a list of his greatest tournament victories 
and a section with photographs of Salo with celebrities. In one of 
the photos he was playing a simultaneous against a group of boys. 
The caption, if memory serves, read: 
Salo Flohr's annual exhibition at the Maribou 
Orphanage-the only home he ever knew as a boy.

Chapter XVI I  
'fhe Gentle Giant of Chess 
Dr. Ossip Bernstein was a broad-shouldered giant of a man with an 
intellect to match. Wearing a blue beret on a Kojak-shaven head and 
sporting an FDR-style cigarette holder cocked upwards at a jaunty 
angle, he shuffled along like the huge, six-foot-four-inch bear that he 
was. 
You never had trouble spotting him in a crowd. 
We first met in January 1946, at the "Victory" International in 
London. From the moment he strode into my hotel room and 
announced himself, we became like old friends. The normal routine 
was for him to visit my room every evening following 
the 
tournament round; and from his ubiquitous briefcase, he would 
dump on my bed a treasure cache of the most wonderful canned 
foods. Ham, cheese, butter, pate, caviar, crackers-all the good 
things that were impossible to find in England at the time. My single 
contribution to the party was Nescafe coffee which I had so 
presciently brought from the States. (Just to give you some idea of 
the English diet in the immediate post-WWII years, I clearly recall 
losing 22 pounds in a stay of six weeks.) 
You can talk about playing baccarat in Biarritz or summering 
along the Cote d'Azur, but for me, the high life was sitting in an 
overcoat on a hotel bed in wintry London, doing justice to Bern­
stein's gourmet goodies and listening to his stories about the great 
masters of the early 1900s. And this man, who was born in 1882 , 
relished nothing more than talking about David Janowski, Jacques 
Mieses, Akiba 
Rubinstein, Karl Schlechter, 
Siegbert Tarrasch, 
Mikhail Tchigorin and other chess immortals. 
By analyzing various positions with Bernstein, I quickly dis­
covered that even at age 63 he remained a strong player. I could see 
why Edward Lasker once wrote, "I believe Bernstein had true world 
championship caliber," and why chess encyclopedist Harry Golom­
bek described Bernstein's style as "massive and sparkling." Yet the 
subject of this lavish praise, who is remembered chiefly for losing 
several famous games to Jose Capablanca, remained a lifelong ama­
teur. He once went 18 years without competing in an important 
178

tournament. 
Chapter XVII 
179 
Clearly, a chess career so slight yet so distinguished was sugges­
tive of a substantial second life away from the board. As Bernstein 
and I pored over chess positions in the cold, bombed-out London of 
nearly a half century ago, my friend told me his story. 
The Fate of Fortunes 
To sum up Ossip Bernstein's life in seven words, he made two 
fortunes and lost three. 
Born in Imperial Russia as a member of what Marxists call the 
haute bourgeoisie, Bernstein wanted for nothing as a youth and in 
1906, took a doctorate of law from Heidelberg. Ever a capitalist at 
heart, he quickly established a highly successful practice in Moscow 
as an international financial lawyer. From 1906 to 1914, he added 
to his family's already considerable fortune, while simultaneously 
making a name for himself as a strong grandmaster. 
Bernstein first attracted attention as a master in 1903 when he 
finished second behind Tchigorin in the All-Russia Championship, 
defeating the winner in their individual game. From 1905 to 1914, 
he participated in nine international tournaments with astonishing 
success for a part-time amateur. His best result was a tie for first 
with Rubinstein at Ostende 1907, one of those dinosaur-sized 
tournaments of yesteryear. The two men each scored 19%-81!2 in a 
29-player field. 
Bernstein also played some extravagant games at Ostende. Take a 
look at the opening of Bernstein-Savielly Tartakower: 1. P-Q4 P­
KB4 2. P-QB4 P-K3 3. N-QB3 N-KB3 4. P-K3 P-Q4 5. B-Q3 N-K5 6. 
N-B3 P-B3 and now 7. P-KN4! ! .  Typical of my brilliant friend. But 
Bernstein's most remarkable game of his most active period in chess 
has to be the following corker, which Irving Chernev once nomi­
nated as the most brilliant and most misunderstood of all drawn 
games: 
Dr. Ossip Bernstein-Aron Nirnzovich 
St. Petersburg, I 9 / 4  
Nirnzoindion Defense 
I .  P-Q4 N-KB3 2. N-KB3 P-K3 3. P-B4 P-QN3 4. N-B3 B-N2 5. P-K3 B-NS

P-QR4 I I .  B-K2 PxP 1 2. PxP RxRch 1 3. BxR 0-0 1 4. 0-0 
Amazing, isn't it? In addition to its distinguished middlegame 
play, this struggle is celebrated as an early illustration of the hyper­
modern principle of controlling central squares with pieces rather 
than pawns. The game seems eerily before its time and provides the

180 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
kind of cold shivers offered by Velasquez's Views from Villa Medici, 
two 17th-century harbingers of Impressionism. 
1 4  . . . .  N-KS 1 5. Q-B2 P-KB4 I 6. N-Q2 NxN 
In his much-ignored annotations to this game, Georg Marco 
explains that 16 . . . .  Q-N4 can be adequately met by 17. P-B4. 
1 7. QxN R-R I 1 8. B-QB3 Q-K I 
Dr. Tarrasch termed this move "difficult to comprehend," while 
Wolfgang Heidenfeld in Draw! failed to comprehend it correctly. As 
for J. Cena's notes in O.S. Bernstein: Parties d'echecs, they are 
tellingly vague at this juncture. Only Marco writes insightfully, 
"Evidently Nimzovich wishes to reply to 19. R-Rl by 19 . . . .  RxRch 
20. BxR Q-Rl, with an attack against the Bishop as well as against 
the KNP. With . . .  Q-Kl, Nimzovich has thus prevented his opponent 
from disputing his control of the QR file (by opposing Rooks). He 
may also have considered continuing 19 . . . .  N-B3, followed by 20 . 
. . .  Q-RS." 
1 9. P-QS P-K4 20. P-B4 B-B I 2 1 .  Q-N2 Q-K2 22. PxP? 
Marco punctuates this move with two interrogatives, whereas we 
in less rigorous times adorn it with one. Interestingly, Heidenfeld, 
Cena and even Dr. Tartakower in Modeme Schachstrategie, his 
book on Bernstein, pass by this move and in consequence com­
pletely misrepresent what occurs later. Marco recommends 22. R-B3 
for White, concluding that the first player would be up a sound 
pawn after 22 . . . .  P-KN4? ! 23. PxNP N-Bl 24. P-R4 N-N3 25. P-N3 ! 
(Marco refutes 25. P-RS in an analysis of stupefying length). 
22 . . . .  NxP 23. B-Q4 B-Q2 24. R-R I R-K I !  25. R-R7 Q-Q I 26. Q-R I P-BS! 
27. PxP N-N3 28. B-KB3 NxP 29. BxKNP 
In the tournament book, Dr. Tarrasch writes, "White fears naught 
and captures the Pawn, as he has calculated to a hairline how he can 
best parry all attacks." In variations, as it were, so writes nearly 
everyone else. But as we shall see, White stands to lose this position. 
29 . . . .  Q-N4 
Marco terms this move the point of 26 . . . .  P-BS. Black threatens 
. . .  Q.x.B, . . .  N-Q6 and . . .  N-R6ch. 
30. B-R8! 
My friend Bernstein does the best that he can.

30 . . . .  N-Q6? 
Chapter XVII 
181 
All of the lads except Marco adorn this move with an exclama­
tion point. Indeed, the move appears immediately destructive, 
threatening 31. . . .  R-K8ch as well as 31. . . .  Q-K6ch. But it also per­
mits White to save himself with a blinding display of defensive pyro­
technics. The winning move is 30. . .  . R-K7 ! ! , and I direct the reader 
to Chess Review (November 1935) for the concrete variations.

game and instead wrote of Sir Henry Channon's dining room, 
"Baroque and rococo and what-ho and oh-no-no and all that. Very 
fine indeed." 
Following the St. Petersburg tournament of 1914, Bernstein did 
not compete in another major master event until Berne 1932. He 
was far too busy surviving that hurricane called history. "The Revo-

182 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
lution of 1917 in Russia," he would later write, "had thrown me out 
of my professional and customary routine, and the successive waves 
of civil war had hurled me from pillar to post until I finally landed 
in Paris." 
Those few words encompass a lot of adventure. Bernstein came 
close to losing his life at Rostov-on-Don in 1917 while on a business 
mission; and he, his wife and two small children later fled from 
Moscow to Kiev, eventually landing up in Odessa, where he was 
arrested by the Cheka, the Red secret police. 
"This arrest," wrote Ossip's good friend Edward Lasker, "took 
place during the 'Red terror,' when the mere fact that a man was a 
member of the well-to-do bourgeoisie stamped him as a criminal. 
Bernstein's crime was his role as legal adviser to bankers, industrial­
ists and trusts. There was, of course, no court trial. One of those 
sadistic minor officials, who always show up on the wake of revolu­
tions when executions are the order of the day, had a firing squad 
line up Bernstein and a number of other prisoners against a wall. 
Then, fortunately, a superior officer appeared who asked to see the 
list of the prisoners' names. Discovering on it the name, Ossip 
Bernstein, he asked him whether he was the famous chess master. 
Not satisfied with Bernstein's affirmative reply, he made him play a 
game with him; and, when Bernstein won in short order, he had 
him and the others led back to prison and later released." 
Yes, I know-yet another story about a last-minute reprieve from 
the firing squad. But Bernstein was absolutely convincing when he 
described at length how his hands were shaking when playing 
against the officer, and I believed his story then and believe it still. 
In 1919, Ossip and family escaped from Odessa on a British ship. 
By a circuitous route through Bulgaria, Turkey, Serbia, Austria and 
Norway, the exhausted Bernsteins washed up in Paris in 1920 with 
barely enough money to live for a month. 
It was sufficient. Having lost his inherited first fortune, Ossip now 
set about amassing his first self-made fortune-and succeeded. But 
he then lost this second fortune in the world financial crash of 1929 
and 1930. Whereupon, he built a second self-made fortune which he 
then lost when fleeing to southern France and eventually escaping 
to Spain after the Germans captured Paris in 1940. He was lucky 
that he did not also lose his life because he was interned by the 
Vichy regime, usually a prelude to being turned over to Adolf 
Eichmann's lads. 
"My wife and I knew that we had to get out of France," Ossip 
told me. "We headed for Spain on foot, walking through the Pyre­
nees at night over mountain roads and hiding in caves during the

day from the Germans and their collaborators. Denker, try to imag­
ine what it was like: two people in late middle age running for their 
lives, stumbling along in pitch darkness, tripping over rocks, and 
skinning our hands and knees every 20 minutes or so. Once, I fell 
flat on my face, which completely knocked the wind out of me. 
After several absolutely exhausting days, tortured by thirst and with 
our clothes in tatters, we reached Spain, and I vaguely remember 
passing unconscious from a heart attack. Thanks to some of my 
friends in Spain, the Spanish border police did not send us back. We 
were among the lucky few." 
In 1945 Bernstein returned to Paris, reestablished contact with 
his son (a prisoner of war in Germany for five years), recouped a 
portion of his financial losses, and later played first board for the 
French at the 1954 Olympiad in Amsterdam. 
Second Chess Career 
Bernstein's second chess career, beginning with Berne 1932, was less 
compelling in terms of tournament results than his first. He scored 
respectably, not spectacularly, and on occasion, as at Groningen 
1946, disastrously. But the great veteran could still bite as he 
proved by nearly devouring Alexander Alekhine in a Paris training 
match of October 1933. That match was drawn, +1 -1 =2, but 
Bernstein did most of the chewing. In 1940 he won a grandiose, 
though seldom published consultation game from Alekhine.

wallows in river mud. He played ambitiously even in simultaneous 
exhibitions and enjoyed showing friends what he called his "lesser

In 1954, at age 72, Bernstein had his last hurrah by tying for 
second with Miguel Najdorf (behind Chile's Rene Letelier) in a 
UNESCO-sponsored event in Montevideo, Uruguay. Moreover, my 
old friend, who was probably smarting from a newspaper article de­
scribing him as "the Grandfather of Chess," captured the First Brilli­
ancy Prize by obliterating Najdorf in one of the prettiest games of 
the 1950s.

Surreality Becomes Reality 
One lovely Paris day in 1953, my wife Nina and I found ourselves in 
the Bernsteins' cozy apartment on Rue des Marronniers. We were 
their guests for lunch, and as we entered the dining room, my wife, 
an art historian, could not take her eyes off a large Chagall canvas 
hanging above the server. Noticing her admiration and astonish­
ment, Ossip said, "I guess you are wondering how we can afford 
such a priceless work of art?" 
Whereupon, our host related a story about how his good friend 
Marc Chagall, whose work prompted poet Guillaume Apollinaire to 
coin the word "surrealist," fled Paris in 1940 before the advancing 
Germans, leaving Mrs. Bernstein the key to his apartment. When the 
Germans arrived, Mrs. B. rounded up several Russian friends, some 
of whom were former nobles working as taxi drivers; and in the 
dead of night, they transported Chagall's paintings to a friend's barn 
in the countryside. If the Nazis had captured these paintings, they 
would have either burned them as examples of Jewish "decadence" 
or sold them into private collections. 
After the war, Chagall returned to Paris, fearing that his paintings 
had been destroyed. When he learned the real surreal story about

Chapter XVII 
187 
what had been done, he was so overcome with emotion that he left 
the room, returning minutes later with a sketch in which a guardian 
angel in the likeness of Mrs. B. floated protectively over a farmhouse 
in a beautiful pastoral setting. 
From this sketch Chagall created the painting that so riveted 
Nina's eyes. 
When Ossip finished the story, Mrs. B. and Nina went out to the 
kitchen to fuss over dessert and coffee. We sat drumming our fingers 
on the table until Ossip grabbed a chess set and his trademark blue 
beret. "Denker," he announced, "it is a fresh summer day in Paris. 
Let's get out of here." 
A few minutes later, we were seated at an outdoor cafe on a 
narrow, Left Bank street. A light breeze cooled us. As Ossip ordered 
coffee and liqueurs, I emptied the pieces on to the board and 
glanced across the street. "Hotel Rue de la Harpe," read a sign. The 
hotel appeared to be one of those small, spotless Parisian hostelries 
run by formidable French females. 
Ossip set up a position which had an interesting legend both 
behind and in front of it. 
White to Play and Win 
During the 1970s, a rumor circulated that the above position 
occurred in a Bernstein-Capablanca game played in Moscow circa 
1914 and that Bernstein resigned at this point. But a Russian 
farmer, so the story goes, became so intrigued with the final 
position that it preyed on his mind day and night. Until, one 
afternoon, the truth dawned on him: Bernstein should not have 
resigned! The farmer worked out a win for White and mailed the 
analysis to Tigran Petrosian, then the editor of 64. Unfortunately, 
the letter lay unopened until Anatoly Karpov assumed the reins. 
Karpov, so the story goes, read the letter and turned it over to 
Mikhail Tal, who was so impressed with the analysis that he went 
looking for the farmer at his collective. Alas, the poor fellow had 
passed away.

188 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
But on that cloudless blue day back in 1953, as I sat sipping on a 
brilliant yellow-green chartreuse, Ossip told a different story about 
the same position. "I first saw the position," he said, "just a few 
years ago while on a business trip to Spain." At a chess club in 
Madrid, a Spanish lad asked Ossip why he had resigned a won game 
and showed him the position and some clever analysis. 
"I hated to disillusion the kid," Ossip told me, "but the entire 
story was a hoax to publicize a very beautiful and exciting problem. 
Capa and I never arrived at such a position. Still, as you Americans 
are always saying, never let facts get in the way of a good story." 
Have you figured out White's win? Well, forget about the obvious 
1. P-Q8=Q, which loses to 1. . . .  N-B2ch. The solution: 
I .  N-B6ch K-N2 
The only move. On 1. . . .  K-N3, White wins with 2. B-R5ch KxN 
3. P-Q8=Qch. And if 1. . . .  K-R1, the winning line is 2. P-Q8=Qch K­
N2 3. N-R5ch K-N3 4. Q-B6ch K-R2 5. Q-N7, mate. 
2. N-RSch K-N3 3. B-B2ch KxN 4. P-Q8=Q N-B2ch 5. K-K6 NxQch 6. K-BS 
The threat is 7. B-Q1ch P-K7 8. BxP, mate. 
6 . . . .  P-K7 7. B-K4 P-K8=N 
Black must prevent 8. B-B3, mate. 
8. B-QS 
The threat is now 9. B-B4 and 10. B-K2ch. 
8 . . . .  P-B7 9. B-B4 P-B8=N I 0. B-NS 
The threat is 11. B-K8ch. 
I 0 . . . . N-QB2 I I .  B-R4 and wins 
Black cannot adequately parry the threat of 12. B-Q1ch. 
Ossip and I worked out the variations meticulously, reckoning 
on every line except one. We overlooked what Capablanca used to 
call a "petite combinaison" on the part of our two queens. They 
mercilessly attacked the weaknesses in our indefensible position 
when we returned to Ossip's apartment six hours overdue! 
"Am I Not a Chess Idiot?" 
Tolerant of human weakness, Ossip Bernstein was a man who 
laughed readily and genuinely at himself. During the Zurich tourna­
ment of 1934, he missed a winning knight maneuver against the

Chapter XVII 
189 
Swiss master, Fritz Gygli, and exclaimed to Emanuel Lasker, "Am I 
not a chess idiot?" 
"That seems to be a reasonable explanation for that move of 
yours," Lasker responded. 
"Will you give me that in writing?" Ossip asked. 
"Gladly," said Lasker. And Bernstein proceeded to draw up a 
quasi-legal document to the stated effect. 
Ossip also exhibited an obvious love and compassion for his 
fellow human beings. His was a wonderful philosophy of acceptance 
so rare these days. Once, in the presence of his eight-year-old 
granddaughter, he asked in his usual booming voice, "Denker, do 
you know why we grandparents love our grandchildren so much?" 
Innocently, I answered that I did not. 
"Because they are the enemies of our enemies," he replied, the 
customary twinkle in his eyes. 
Only years later-well after Ossip's death at St. Arroman in the 
Pyrenees on November 30, 1962-did I grasp the depth of that 
remark. You see, he enjoyed making combinations even when away 
from the chess board.

Chapter XVI I I  
Isaac JCashdan: 'The Gentle, 
Scientific Grandmaster 
Here is how the New York Times reported the death on February 
20, 1985, of a famous American chess master: "Isaac Kashdan, one 
of the foremost chess players in the United States in the 1930s and 
1940s and for many years the chess editor of the Los Angeles 
Times, died Wednesday at his home in West Los Angeles. He was 79 
years old and is survived by his wife of over 50 years, Mrs. Helen 
Kashdan, and a son, Richard." 
But for me, "Isaac Kashdan, one of the foremost chess players in 
the United States," was simply "Kash"-a flesh-and-blood man 
whom I knew well and deeply respected. And, yes, whom I liked 
very much. 
In the most important sense, Kash was unlike other grand­
masters. I never detected a trace of anger or violence in the man. 
Against the backdrop of New York City in the Depression 1930s, his 
gentle and kind ways made him seem almost too civilized. We were 
the Young Turks back then, and we stepped on a few toes. But not 
Kash. I remember occasions when he became annoyed at some un­
kind or nasty remark. He would never react meanly, though he did 
have a quiet humor leavened, when necessary, with sarcasm. 
Kash was, then, different from the rest of us. And so was his 
chess. As a player, he resembled a scientist, holding a position up to 
the light and turning it this way and that, rather than a warrior 
readying for the kifl. But don't misunderstand me: Isaac Kashdan 
was a very great player indeed. At the 1928 Hague Olympiad, he 
scored + 12 -1 =2 on first board to take the gold medal. His overall 
score in Olympiad play of +52 -5 =22 is second to none among 
American grandmasters. In 1930, after defeating Lajos Steiner in 
match play, he again travelled to Europe, winning three strong 
tournaments, and finishing second in a fourth. Kash played 49 
games in Europe that year, winning 36, drawing 10 and losing 
three. Against the flower of European masterhood, he scored 41-8 
191

192 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
(over 83 percent), setting a pace more appropriate for Swiss system 
events. 
Subsequently, Kash finished second to Jose Capablanca at New 
York 1931 and to Alexander Alekhine at Pasadena 1932. During his 
heyday from 1928 to 1934, he and Salo Flohr were regarded as the 
two strongest challengers for Alekhine's crown, given the world 
champion's disinclination to permit Capablanca a rematch. Indeed, 
Kash played the world champion to a virtual standstill, losing only 
once in, if memory serves, six or seven tournament games. No 
wonder that Alekhine himself once predicted that Kashdan was his 
most likely successor. 
Kash's strength was in the endgame, and he was often called der 
kleine Capablanca. In the middlegame, there was the slightest 
touch of rigidity: He loved the two Bishops too much. In this 
limited sense, it would not be preposterous, though admittedly un­
kind and inaccurate, to call him der kleine Janowski. "What he 
lacked," Reuben Fine once wrote of Kash, "was knowledge of the 
openings, and the willingness to risk tactical adventures; eventually, 
in spite of his comprehensive grasp of the game, his overcautious­
ness began to take its toll." I think that Reuben is too hard on Kash, 
forgetting that this world-class grandmaster also had to make a 
living during the Depression years. Kash's problem was not caution 
but lack of practice. 
The central tragedy of Kash's chess life was his failure to win the 
U.S. Championship, which might have provided him with the 
economic wherewithal to pursue chess full time. From 1928 on­
wards, Kash was clearly the best player in the United States, but the 
aging Frank Marshall was attached to his title. Kash bargained and 
haggled with Frank for years until Marshall voluntarily relinquished 
the crown. The result: the first modern U.S. Championship tourna­
ment in 1936. But by this time, Fine and Samuel Reshevsky had 
surpassed Kash. 
In 1942, Kash came within a move-that is, a move by AI 
Horowitz-of winning the cherished title of U.S. champion. He was 
sitting on a final score of 12lf2-2lf2 as he also sat and watched 
Reshevsky (12) struggle to save an endgame two pawns down. And 
sure enough, Horowitz missed a win at the 58th turn. A playoff 
match was arranged between Reshevsky and Kashdan that Sammy 
won, 7%-3%. The tally is deceptive because not only did the two 
grandmasters trade victories in the first four games, but also 
Reshevsky had few easy wins in the match. Kash's victory in game 
two ended Sammy's unbeaten streak in U.S. title play at 76 games. 
In game four, Kash did something that many of us thought im­
possible: He methodically ground Reshevsky into submission. Virtu-

nlly no one did that back then. "I had butterflies in my stomach 
playing over that game," wrote GM Arthur Bisguier in Chess Life 
shortly after Kash's death, "because I knew from hard experience in 
the 1950s the difficulty of squeezing Sammy."

"Kashdan plays perfect chess all the way through," wrote Reuben 
Fine of this game, "and makes Reshevsky pay for some slight inaccu­
racies in the opening." Slight indeed! 
In his Chess Life comments, Bisguier hit on another truth about 
Kash's play: "So Kashdan was a positional player. But there is one 
qualification to this statement: He belonged to an older generation 
of players that still sought truth at the board rather than the point. 
Thus, when the occasion demanded, he let loose with risky, 
sacrificial attacks." All of which explains Kashdan's "Immortal 
Game," a masterpiece against a player of IM strength that in its 
outrageous sacrificial extravagance dwarfs many more celebrated 
brilliancies.

He Gave as Well as Received 
Kash was a giver. In 1933 he and A1 Horowitz started Chess 
Review. A fine problemist and Kriegspiel player, Kash set up several 
feature departments in what developed into a great magazine. But 
the Depression years were tight; food itself was no sure bet; and 
Kash sold his interest in Chess Review to work at odd jobs in order 
to support his family. When his second son required special medical

196 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
care and a warm climate, Kash and Helen moved to California. It 
was a great sacrifice because in those days New York was America's 
only chess town. 
Still, it was not long before Kash got things going in California. 
He promoted tournaments, and he wrote a chess column for the Los 
Angeles Times after Herman Steiner's death in 1955-a column that 
he held until a disabling stroke in 1982. He was the spark plug 
behind the famous Piatigorsky Cup tournaments of 1963 and 1966, 
though his lasting memorial will be the series of Lone Pine tourna­
ments from 1971 to 1981. With financing from his good friend 
Louis Statham, he turned tiny Lone Pine (pop. 900) into the pre­
eminent spa of world chess. 
As remarkable as Kash's accomplishments were, I will remember 
him for other things-for those magical moments when memory 
holds the door. There was the time, more than a half century ago, 
when Kash, Helen and the rest of the American delegation were on 
an ocean liner headed for the 1933 Folkestone Olympiad. AI 
"Buddy" Simonson had gone a few drinks beyond his limit, and he 
proceeded to pass out in Kash and Helen's stateroom. But no 
matter, never mind-as was said of the philosophical dispute 
between Bishop Berkeley and David Hume. Kash simply smiled 
philosophically and let him sleep. "We all know that Buddy can't 
handle more than one drink," he said. 
Or there was the formal dinner at the Hastings tournament of 
1931-1932. The Colonel Nawab Sir Umar Hayat Khan, the patron 
of famous Indian master Sultan Khan, took a liking for Helen 
Kashdan. He offered Kash 150 English pounds for her to join his 
harem. "It will be much easier for you to replace her," he told Kash, 
"than for me to find another Helen at my age." 
Many men might have taken offense. Kash retold that story many 
times with undiminished enjoyment.

the Candle at cf3oth ends 
The Great Depression was a terrible time for most people, but like 
all periods of history, it had compensations. For chess at least, the 
Depression years provided the backdrop for America's most success­
ful era internationally. Imagine having to select an Olympiad team 
from this star-studded array of talent: Weaver Adams, Sidney Bern­
stein, Arthur Dake, Reuben Fine, AI Horowitz, Edward Lasker, Isaac 
Kashdan, Alexander Kevitz, Frank Marshall, Fred Reinfeld, Sammy 
Reshevsky, Anthony Santasiere, George Shainswit, Albert Simon­
son, Herman Steiner, George Treysman, Robert Willman and others. 
Is it any wonder that American teams dominated the Olympiads of 
the 1930s? 
Unfortunately, many of these players were unable to compete in 
Olympiads or other events in Europe because of what the poet Gray 
called "chill penury." Back then, defrayed travelling expenses and 
honoraria were unknown; a master competed merely for the honor 
of representing his country. Players had to pay their own way, 
though a few were fortunate enough to have patrons willing to foot 
some of the bill. Lack of money, then, and little else kept us from 
achieving even greater things. Had we been allowed (and had we 
been capable) of fielding three teams, I firmly believe we would 
have walked away with all three medals in the Olympiads. 
The American chess stars of the 1930s congregated in New York 
City, and from this fiery cauldron of competition emerged a tall, 
slender young man with bright black eyes and a long nose that 
seemed to keep watch over a ribbony moustache. This man had an 
optimistic approach to life and was quick to see the humor in most 
situations. He was gentle and sensitive, as befitted a young man 
descended from a long line of rabbis. He loved chess and unselfishly 
dedicated his life to the game. Though he was very poor until late in 
life, I never heard him complain. AI Horowitz, one of four sons born 
to Mr. and Mrs. Louis Horowitz, was a truly rich man.

Where Chess Review was Born 
Chapter XIX 
201 
Al might have remained "just another" of those now nearly forgot­
ten masters of the 1930s had it not been for the Great Depression. 
Working as a trader at the Wall Street firm of Hoit, Rose & Troster, 
AI found that by 1932 he could no longer make a living. And so, 
strictly for economic reasons, he abandoned Wall Street! "I re­
turned to chess," he used to say, "on the theory that I could win a 
quarter a game and that a quarter could buy a meal." 
Al also turned to something else-a marvelous undertaking that 
would captivate him for the rest of his life. In 1933, at the height of 
the Great Depression, he got the idea that chess would have a much 
larger following if it had a modern magazine with lively articles and 
photographs. He took on Isaac Kashdan as his partner, borrowed 
money from his friend Fritz Brieger, and rented a loft at 60-10 
Roosevelt Avenue in Queens-the manger where Chess Review was 
born. 
Starting a business when everyone else was ceasing business 
proved tough sledding. As the years passed, one partner after an­
other came and went. Lesser men would have despaired, but Al had 
faith. To keep the magazine afloat, he wrote books (all told, about 
20) and barnstormed the country for months at a time, giving free 
simuls to all who subscribed. And sometimes the tours brought 
their own rewards:

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Al's courage in adversity shone through during one of his barn­
storming tours. On February 17, 1940, about seven miles west of 
Carroll, Iowa, he and travelling companion Harold Morton, the New 
England champion, met head on a motor van driven by one Frank 
Robbins. Morton was killed instantly, and AI wound up in St. 
Anthony's Hospital in Carroll with severe internal injuries. Although 
AI lost the hearing in his left ear, he wasn't fazed. He now had the 
advantage, or so he quipped, of being able to turn a truly deaf ear to 
bothersome people. 
Chess players hung together in the poor old days. In 1936, AI 
and I shared a room at the Lincoln Hotel in New York. The night 
manager, an Indian named Chief Hall, was a loyal member of the 
Manhattan Chess Club, and he saw to it that we stayed at the 
Lincoln on a "due-bill." (To this day I have no idea what a "due­
bill" may be. All I know is that we never paid rent.) We also shared 
all of our worldly possessions (zilch), and whoever hustled a few 
quarters that day bought dinner. When there were no quarters, our 
dinner was bread, beans and coffee procured after standing for hours 
in a blocks-long bread line. 
AI and I prepared opening variations together for unsuspecting 
masters-variations that we got a chance to try out that summer at 
the U.S. Open in Philadelphia. This tournament was organized by 
the American Chess Federation, a body that merged with the Na­
tional Chess Federation in 1939 to form the present-day U.S. Chess 
Federation. 
But as I was saying, in a strong field of a dozen of the country's 
top players, AI finished first, and I tied for second with Arthur Dake. 
In spite of our success, we had to borrow money to get back to New 
York because the tournament director ran off with the prizes. Here 
is Al's best win at Philadelphia, an effort of sustained attacking and 
sacrificial virtuosity that compares more than favorably with many 
of today's brilliancies:

This little-known gem is unquestionably one of the classic attack­
ing games of 20th century chess. 
That same year of 1936, thanks to another example of Fritz 
Brieger's generosity, the first modern U.S. Championship was held 
at the old and elegant Hotel Astor in New York City. It was a great 
tournament, with as many as 500 spectators a day straining to get a 
look at the games. The newspapers ran photographs and daily re­
ports. At long last, chess appeared to come of age. But there were 
still many tough years ahead before Chess Review began to pay off. 
Al was a marvelous mimic and storyteller. His descriptions of 
how the rabbis in his house sat around the table and debated the 
Talmud were so vivid that when I visited his home in Brooklyn, it 
seemed as if I had already met the other guests. And as a chess

204 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
master, Al was of the highest rank. He played in eight U.S. Cham­
pionships, placing as high as a tie for third in 1944. The top spot al­
ways eluded him, though several times he began with a dazzling 
string of wins, only to fall apart in the final rounds. Incredibly, 31f2 
decades separated his first championship in 1936 from his last in 
1972, just one year before his death. In 1941, he challenged the 
then invincible Sammy Reshevsky to a match for the national title 
and lost a very hard-fought encounter, +0 -3 =13. 
Al's chess style was as sharp as a Ninja sword, and drastic 
fireworks were common in his games. For example, in the following 
position, Black has just played 21. . . .  R-K1, a natural enough move. 
But imagine his shock when Al announced mate in seven!

Many of Al's better games possessed a panoramic quality. They 
were heroic affairs with involved conceptions. As in the win over 
Kashdan, he never stinted his imagination. And, too, he could defeat 
the greatest.

"You Can Take Rat Poison on It!" 
Next to George Treysman, AI Horowitz was the best odds-giver in 
the United States. He would never hesitate to grant Knight odds to 
players strong enough to warrant only pawn and move. Yet he was 
successful thanks to psychological tactics and engaging banter, not 
to mention a natural genius for the game. "The penguin," he would 
declaim grandiloquently when pinning an opponent's piece, "is 
mightier than the swordfish." And if his opponent reached to make 
a devastating move, AI would lean over and inquire confidentially, 
"We are playing touch move, aren't we?" The flustered opponent 
would usually withdraw his hand automatically and deny ever hav­
ing touched the piece! I remember one time when AI had a lost po­
sition against Buster Horneman, a local amateur. AI told Buster the 
winning move. The moved looked good, but naturally, Buster was 
suspicious. "Can I trust you?" he asked. "If I tell you it wins," AI 
answered, "you can take rat poison on it!" 
AI tirelessly publicized chess wherever he went. "It's a great 
game! "  he used to exclaim. "No matter how bad one is, there is 
always somebody worse. If you lose to a 10-year-old, then select a 
nine-year-old, and so on, down the line, until you have met some­
one slightly worse than yourself." When AI took over the New York 
Times chess column in 1962 from an aging Hermann Helms, who 
had written it gracefully for over SO years, his infectious enthusiasm 
helped to convince the editors of that staid institution to run col-

Chapter XIX 
207 
umns three times a week. AI kept the column until October 1972, 
when illness compelled him to leave Reykjavik, Iceland, during the 
Fischer-Spassky match. 
AI burned the candle at both ends. On the average, he put in a 
full day at Chess Review before popping in at the Marshall Chess 
Club around 7 p.m. A few hours later he could be found kibitzing at 
Fischer's 42nd Street Emporium, and still later at about 11 p.m., he 
would wind up the day playing skittles at the Manhattan Chess 
Club, offering Knight odds to all comers until closing time. Then off 
he would go to his favorite delicatessen for a late-night snack of hot 
dogs and beans or for a second hot pastrami sandwich to chase the 
one that he ate for lunch. 
Where food and most other things were concerned, AI was a 
confirmed New Yorker. One report had him lamenting the absence 
of hot pastrami sandwiches in Iceland while he was still at the 
Fischer-Spassky match. At any rate, to conclude Al's typical day, he 
dragged himself off to bed at about 4 a.m. after smoking the last of 
his third pack of cigarettes. 
I once asked Al why he never took a vacation, since I felt that 
some fresh air and exercise would do him good. Jokingly he replied, 
"Are you trying to kill me?" Is it any wonder that he never had the 
stamina to play through a tournament at a consistently high level? 
The wonder to me was that he was able to do as well as he did given 
his devotion to awful health habits. 
AI "retired" in 1969 when he sold Chess Review to the USCF. 
For the first time in his life, he wasn't poor, though he kept up the 
breakneck pace. 
I last saw AI shortly before his death. He looked emaciated. Years 
of heavy smoking and a total lack of exercise wrecked his circula­
tory system. He knew that he was dying and fought back the tears 
when we met. Then, with a faint smile, he said, "We had some good 
times, didn't we?" Ours was the saddest of partings. Death came a 
few weeks later, on January 18, 1973. He was 65. 
Israel Albert Horowitz will be remembered always as a rare, un­
selfish worker for the royal game-a man who, as we used to say, 
brought oil for the lamps of Caissa. His place in the lore of American 
chess will forever be secure.

Chapter XX 
'fhe cJ>aderewski of Chess 
If you are ever down Argentine Way and happen to meet a group of 
excited chess players crowded around a small balding man, the odds 
are that you have stumbled upon Moishe, Miguel, Mieczyslaw or 
Mendel Najdorf holding court on the second floor of the elegant 
Buenos Aires Chess Club. 
How do I know? 
Well, I know Mendel, as he is called by his friends. And I also 
know the allure that he exerts. This virtuoso of the chess board, 
who moves pieces to the correct squares as fluently as Paderewski 
played the piano, draws people to him like a magnet attracts iron 
filings. He is beloved throughout the chess world as being among 
the most generous and gifted of great masters. 
In spite of unbelievable adversity, Mendel has never given up on 
life by surrendering to bitterness, though Lord knows he had reason 
to do so. Suffice it to say, Mendel became Argentina's greatest 
grandmaster by staying on in the country following the Buenos 
Aires Olympiad of 1939. This young Jew, born in 1910 and a native 
of Poland, had no illusions about a future in his Nazi-occupied 
homeland. 
Mendel the Master 
As a chess master, Mendel is renowned for the breadth of his endeav­
ors. Not content with tournament and match competitions, he took 
up blindfold chess, playing 45 games simultaneously back in 194 7 .  
By the reckoning of some folks, he is the sans voir world 
champion, though many authorities argue the case for either George 
Koltanowski or Alexander Alekhine. 
Najdorf also made a run at the world title for regular chess back 
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, competing in two candidates' 
tournaments. He came fifth at Budapest in 1950 and sixth at the 
famous Zurich 1953 fixture. In addition, he missed becoming 
"Champion of the Western World" when he lost two highly publi­
cized matches to Sammy Reshevsky in 1952 (+4 -8 =6) and 1953 
211

212 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
( +4 -5 =9). In the 1970 "Match of the Century" between the late 
U.S.S.R and the World, he scored +1 -1 =2 against Mikhail Tal. 
That, in brief, is the story of Mendel's "serious" chess. It is also 
the least interesting part of his story as a chess master, since it was 
obvious to everyone that he would never become world champion 
without studying opening theory-something that he had no inten­
tion of doing because of professional workaday obligations. Unlike, 
say, Frank Marshall and Reshevsky, he could not work full time on 
chess. Indeed, Mendel worked scarcely at all on chess. He and his 
friend, GM Carlos Guimard, labored instead at building an insurance 
business that eventually grew to over 100 employees and made 
both of them rich. 
The most interesting thing about Mendel as a grandmaster is his 
style and how that style contributed to his winning numerous 
mixed tournaments ahead of men who excelled him in high­
category candidates' events. Besides winning at least a dozen inter­
national tournaments in Mar del Plata, he took first prizes at such 
stellar events as Amsterdam 1950 (ahead of Reshevsky) and Havana 
1962 (ahead of Boris Spassky, Vassily Smyslov, Lev Polugaevsky et 
alia). Typically, he tallied lopsided results of 80 percent and higher 
in these and other tournaments. 
Mendel had a knack for mowing down the bottom half of mixed 
tournaments, and this facility earned him a reputation as a risk­
taking tactician rather than a positional player. Which is flatly 
wrong. Yet the source for this disinformation is none other than 
Mendel himself! Just read his charming "Salad Days" article in the 
July 1964 Chess Review in which this crafty and witty man anno­
tated three of his best games: an early tournament contest, a simul­
taneous effort and a quickie at Queen Rook odds. Forget about 
deep positional victories over Mikhail Botvinnik, Boris Spassky and 
many others. Mendel gave us instead what he values in chess, and 
we then carelessly concluded that blinding brilliancy defined the 
Najdorf style. In an issue of La Nacion (1944), Mendel described the 
following miniature as his best game, while in the "Salad Days" 
article he called it "one of the most brilliant of . . .  [my] youth":

Where and when was this game played? Mendel gives his oppo­
nent as one Frenke and the where-when as Warsaw 1927, but Raul 
Castelli in his jNajdorf! lists the opponent as one Sapiro and the 
where-when as Lodz 1929. Such confusion reigns because while my

Referring to himself in the third person, Mendel writes, "He was 
fascinated by the magic of combinations and sought particularly for 
that continuous sacrifice of pieces which, aimed for attack on the 
enemy King, reckons without regard for material since, in the end, 
the goal will have been reached . . . .  He was not content with a simple 
routine victory but probed for the hidden and the spectacular."

The above game, along with the famous Gliicksberg-Najdorf 
"Polish Immortal," represents Najdorfs style for many people. And 
Mendel certainly plays along with the myth that he is merely a 
tactical child of nature. In truth, he achieved his famed shutouts 
against the lower half of tournament tables with a style that was 
half-Capablanca and half-Lasker. He took positional rather than Tal­
like tactical risks.

Many of Mendel's games, like those of Jose Capablanca, are diffi­
cult to play but easy to play over. The current game is simplicity 
itself: Mendel gambits the Queen Rook pawn, and the moment he 
wins it back, the game is over. That's all.

Occasionally, Mendel lets the cat out of the bag and reveals how 
hard he strives for the kind of easy simplicity that only results from 
skilled application of positional principles. Here is a victory-a vic­
tory highly praised by Bobby Fischer-over Paul Keres, along with 
some of Mendel's notes in quotation marks:

"Now the game changes to the Dutch Defense. I believe, after N­
QB3, that the Dutch is not best because Black's KB is normally his 
best piece and should be preserved at K2 or Q3. It was my first time 
to play this system, and I believe that next I should not play the 
normal P-KN3, but rather P-K3 and castle quickly."

"White could play P-QR3, obligating the exchange of Black's 
Bishop. However, why lose a tempo for this when Black's KB is not 
strong here. You must never have fear of poorly placed pieces. Don't 
force your opponent to make a good move!"

"A strategic error. Why? Because Keres has opened the game too 
early; White has better freedom of movement. Don't open the 
position when you are less developed than your opponent. Black 
should have played for a closed position. The right move was 9.

"Whenever the opponent has two or three pawns advancing

And so, one sees that Mendel also wins games against the greatest 
masters and makes the victories look easy. I believe that his notes 
to the above game, which employ phrases such as "very easy," "very 
clear" and "very simple," constitute a tiny testament of his style. 
Add to this simplicity a willingness on his part to take positional 
gambles against lesser lights, and you explain his celebrated results 
in mixed tournaments. 
Mendel the Man 
The year was 1946, the place was Groningen, Holland, where 20 of 
the strongest masters in the world met to play in the first important 
chess tournament following World War II. Mendel Najdorf was on 
hand representing Argentina, and we struck up a friendship that has 
lasted to this day. Although I played earlier that year at Hastings 
and London, Groningen was my first major international test. Men-

Chapter XX 
217 
del showed me the ropes, imparting some great insider advice for 
which I am still grateful. 
One day, while we were lunching together at the Hotel Frigge, 
something happened that will forever remain fresh in my memory. 
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a shabbily dressed woman shuffled over 
to our table and asked if she could sit down. 
The woman said that she had news for Mendel. Now, "news" of a 
certain genre is the detritus of war; and settling into a chair, she 
told Mendel that she witnessed his wife and other family members 
Ƶoing to the Nazi ovens. She showed him some family mementoes. 
The two began to sob, and she bared a forearm to show her camp 
number. Whereupon, the sobbing turned to uncontrolled weeping. 
The two got up together and left. 
To an innocent American, this-the saddest scene that I had ever 
witnessed-was almost unbelievable. Oh, yes, I knew that a mad­
man had struck across Europe and destroyed tens of millions of 
people. But my knowledge was gleaned from newspapers and news­
reels. Normal men, as French philosopher David Rousset has ob­
served, do not know that everything is possible; and I lacked what 
psychologists call "felt knowledge" until that awful afternoon nearly 
a half century past. 
Finally, Mendel heard the news for which he had waited since 
that day in late September 1939, following the conclusion of the 
Buenos Aires Olympiad, when he elected to remain in Argentina. 
Stranded in a foreign land with no money and a language barrier to 
surmount, this young Polish Jew created a new and prosperous life 
for himself, all the while dreaming about being reunited with his 
family. The dream was now shattered. 
Mendel eventually remarried, fathered two daughters who both 
became medical doctors and settled into the sweetness of life recov­
ered. Until, that is, his new wife developed cancer and quickly 
passed away. He visited us in New York, and although I knew how 
hard he was hit by this second tragedy, he never uttered a word of 
complaint. Mendel's considerate behavior earned him the love and 
respect of all his friends. 
Mendel and Me 
It is always a tremendous pleasure to meet up with Mendel, and 
when I was invited to participate in the 1948 Mar del Plata Inter­
national, I was desperate to play. To spend evenings talking and 
pushing wood with Mendel and to acquaint myself with Buenos 
Aires, the pearl of South America-well, few delights, to paraphrase

218 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
the poet Swinburne, could more surely consume a chess master's 
desire. 
The problem was that the invitation arrived just as I was plan­
ning to give up chess. My wife Nina and I were living in a small 
apartment in Forest Hills with two growing boys, and she de­
manded that Mar del Plata be my final chess fling. As I agreed to her 
conditions, I couldn't help recalling George Bernard Shaw's observa­
tion about desire fulfilled: "There are two tragedies in life. One is to 
lose your heart's desire. The other is to gain it." 
Still, I set out for Mar del Plata determined to conquer the chess 
world. But I played despicably. After starting well with two wins 
and six draws, I reeled off seven straight losses before recovering 
with draws in the final two rounds. My total was 6-11, which was 
good enough to tie for 16th-17th in an 18-player field. What hit me 
was the gambling bug, and my ups and downs in the tournament 
were like a graph of my luck at the roulette and card tables. 
After arriving in Buenos Aires, I hooked up with Grandmaster 
Gideon Stahlberg, a hard-drinking Swede who, like Najdorf, was a 
member of the Class of '39 that decided to sit out the war in 
Argentina. He promptly introduced me to his foolproof system of 
winning at roulette, which fit in nicely with daily poker games and 
sessions of trente et un. In about a week I was broke and had to 
borrow money from Mendel just to survive. I also began losing chess 
games like a child. 
I gave up poker and jettisoned roulette, but trente et un fasci­
nated me. Well-dressed gentlemen with immaculate silver manes and 
the graceful gaits of retired matadors sat at the tables behind moun­
tainous stacks of chips. They were invariably accompanied by beau­
tiful women and always played for high stakes. From one of the 
croupiers, I learned that these men, who accorded with my idea of 
how aristocrats ought to look, were the famous cattle barons of 
Patagonia. 
They were also my financial saviors. I reasoned that these gentle­
men must eventually lose, and each day for no longer than 20 
minutes, I bet against their largest bets. Soon, I recouped almost all 
of my losses and paid back Mendel. Luck or insightful strategy? 
Whatever the answer to that question, there has never been any 
luck in Mendel's results against me in five-minute chess. Although 
our friendship dates back over 40 years, we always play chess, as 
Edward Lasker used to say, for blood. Back in 1981, during the 
Korchnoi-Karpov title match at Merano, we played speed chess vir­
tually every day. I would have lost a lot of lire except that I placed

Chapter XX 
219 
some large bets with him on Karpov and wound up nicely ahead, 
even though my wife threw some expensive champagne parties. 
Mendel got his revenge in Moscow during the first Kasparov­
Karpov match back in 1984. He would invite me to the National 
Hotel for dinner with him and his wife, and afterwards we would 
repair to his suite and play past midnight. Showing no mercy, he 
beat me like a baby. There was one evening that I came out ahead a 
measly three rubles; otherwise, I lost miserably. 
Only once have I seen Mendel at a complete loss when playing 
speed chess. That was at Wijk aan Zee in 1971, when he challenged 
his personal chess nemesis, Tigran Petrosian. 
In tournaments, 
Petrosian ran up a huge plus score against Mendel, who seemed 
helpless against the great Armenian, though he could hold his own 
against Tigran-tamer, Boris Spassky. Well, Tigran whipped Mendel 
game after game, and the more the former won, the sadder the 
latter looked. The scene was pathetic. Najdorf could not win a 
single game. His customary witty banter deserted him, and he began 
to look up at me piteously. I was deeply saddened by the cruel 
spectacle. 
Mendel in the Mood 
Mendel is never better than in a chess ambience. At tournaments, 
the moment he makes a move, he jumps up from his seat as though 
pricked by a pin and rushes nervously out of the playing enclosure 
into the public gallery. He will then wail that he has a lost game 
(translation: he is about to win) or buttonhole passersby with the 
invariable question, "Wie stehe ich?" or "How do I stand?" On one 
occasion, he distractedly asked this question of a bespectacled 
young man wandering outside the playing enclosure, who replied 
only with a scornful smile. The bystanders roared as Mendel 
blushed, for he had addressed the question to his opponent! 
One evening back in 1978 at the time of the Buenos Aires 
Olympiad, Mendel invited me to the world famous Buenos Aires 
Chess Club. As you enter what was once a large private home, you 
face an imposing wooden staircase. To the left and right are spa­
cious rooms for chess, but the real action takes place on the second 
floor in the club room where Mendel holds court amid huge leather 
armchairs and sofas. As people sit about sipping coffee or enjoying a 
snack, our hero talks grandly about chess. When the soliloquy even­
tually yields to passionate Latin disagreements, Mendel usually 
challenges the opponent to a speed match at odds from 10 to 20 to 
one. To refuse the challenge would be to concede error. 
Suddenly, it's Mendel in the mood. With a wide grin, he beats out

220 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
a friendly banter while winning game after game to the vast amuse­
ment of the gallery. Finally, he orders drinks for everyone, including 
the opponent. These days, holding court is his great love. He thrives 
on it. 
And if you look closely, you can see him grow larger as the 
evening moves on.

"You know that, I know that, but these silly people don't 
know that. " 
-Alexander Alekhine (Manhattan Chess Club, 1932) 
What if I were to tell you that a young man did not learn the 
moves of chess until age 17, that he did not play in his first 
tournament until age 20, and that by age 21 he was a member of 
the world championship American team at the Prague Olympiad of 
193 1 ?  
Right, but I'm not nuts. The young man was Arthur Dake, a play­
er who had in the words of chess immortal Reuben Fine, who 
knows of what he speaks, "a natural gift for the game which has 
rarely been equalled." 
Arthur arrived in New York in the late summer of 1929 with only 
a sailor's duffel bag slung over his shoulder and a determination to 
meet and beat the great masters of the greatest city on earth. 
"Grand Central Station," Arthur would later say, "was so big and 
my hometown, Portland, so small, that it took me 30 minutes to 
find my way out of the place." 
Believe him. Arthur never tells lies and is incapable of cynical 
calculation. Not, mind you, that these fine qualities are expressions 
of freely made moral choices. They are not. They are simply part of 
the man-a natural gentleman of childlike earnestness with an 
authentically powerful mind that is without a reflective, intellectual 
cast. When Larry Parr, the co-author of this book, went to interview 
Arthur at his home in 1984, he was greeted even before reaching the 
porch. In the middle of the front yard, Arthur slapped Larry on the 
back, thrust a piece of devotional literature at him ("One Day at a 
Time"), and hustled him into the living room to the roar of Victory 
at Sea, which is what Arthur calls "inspirational music." 
Larry thought that meeting the 7 4-year-old Dake was a lot like 
running into a tornado of chitchat. Imagine, then, what Arthur was 
like back in 1929 ! Imagine what electricity this kinetic and frenetic 
221

222 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
man generated on the New York chess scene. 
First, though, I want to pause for a deep breath and ask if you've 
heard the story about. . .  
Playing Pots with Alekhine 
One evening about 60 years ago at the Manhattan Chess Club, 
Arthur and I found ourselves pushing wood 
with 
Alexander 
Alekhine at 25 cents a game. A large crowd collected around our 
table as the world champion took the first three pots, whereupon I 
won a couple. Arthur then mopped up by winning six off the reel. 
As Arthur's streak mounted, Alekhine's face went from red to 
purple. The humiliation of reaching into a little black coin purse to 
fetch more quarters, combined with surrendering his seat at the 
board, enraged the champion. He challenged Arthur to a match, 
who begged off. "Everyone here knows that you would slaughter 
me in a match, so why play one?" said Arthur. Mollified for the 
moment, Alekhine levelled the challenge a second time after Arthur 
kept winning. 
"Look Doctor," Arthur said tactfully, "I know you are the better 
player and are merely off-form this evening." 
Gesturing at the spectators surrounding the board, Alekhine re­
plied, "You know that, I know that, but these silly people don't 
know that!" 
Here was the great Alexander Alexandrovich Alekhine, who 
stood astride the chess world with arms akimbo like the Colossus of 
Rhodes, challenging a then virtually unknown American master 
from Portland, Oregon, to a match. The scene would have been sad 
if it had not been so funny. 
Alekhine's next disaster against Arthur came a few months later­
to be exact, on August 28, 1932. At the Pasadena International, 
Arthur became the first American to defeat the world champion in 
tournament play.

Much that is pure hokum has been written about this move. 
Walter Korn says that Alekhine desired "to lure a possibly bookish 
novice into the unknown," whereas Reuben Fine uncharacteristi­
cally cops out with, "A peculiar place for the Bishop, but Black

wishes to force a clarification." 
Chapter XXI 
223 
Clarification, indeed. Arthur tells the story this way: "Alekhine 
and I had spent the previous day analyzing the Panov Attack against 
the Caro-Kann. So as a psychological ploy, he played into our 
analysis-all the while searching me with his famous piercing stare. 
But I looked him right back in the eye and played 6. N-B3. He then 
visibly weakened and tried the inferior 6 . . . .  B-K3." Boundless and 
often careless confidence was Arthur's stock in trade.

intently studying the position.

Awarded two exclamation points by Fine. "I wanted to trade 
Queens against history's greatest attacking player," 
admitted 
Arthur, "but after 29. QxQch KxQ, the Black King marches to Q4, 
with a hard win for White." Arthur's frank statement that he feared

224 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
the world champion even when enjoying a clearly winning position 
points up the man's utter inability to dissemble. He always says 
what is on his mind, a trait that is morally praiseworthy and social­
ly dangerous.

From Kecskemet in 1927 
through Bad Nauheim in 1936, 
Alekhine lost four games in regular tournaments. As Fine wrote of 
this battle, "To beat Alekhine was always a notable feat." 
But Not Grapes of Wrath 
When Arthur finally found his way out of Grand Central Station, he 
headed directly to the Seaman's Institute on the Bowery, where he 
met a world-class checker master, Kenneth Grover. The two men set 
up a chess-and-checker stand on Coney Island, taking on all comers 
for a quarter a game. Thus began his immersion in the chess sub­
culture of New York. 
Within a month after Arthur's arrival in New York City, the stock 
market crashed. Customers quit coming to Coney Island; members 
dropped out of the Manhattan and Marshall chess clubs; students 
became scarce. AI Horowitz helped by giving Arthur some of his 
students-an act of extraordinary generosity during the Great De­
pression. But the future "Grandmaster from Oregon," to quote the 
title of Casey Bush's recent book about Arthur, had no family in 
New York and, therefore, no safe harbor away from street reality. 
Just procuring a place to sleep and an occasional meal of hot dogs 
and beans became an epic struggle. 
Arthur, loose-limbed and gangly to begin with, grew as thin as 
the shiny seat of his pants. He was suffering for what he would later 
call "fame and glory, art for art's sake." His diet narrowed down to 
water, coffee and green grapes. Indeed, Ruby Fine explained only 
half-jokingly that Arthur eventually gave up chess because "he 
couldn't live on grapes any longer." 
Arthur tried everything to stay in chess. He and Grover ran poker 
games in their midtown Manhattan digs just off Sixth Avenue and 
52nd Street. But the two gamesmen found that line of play too 
double-edged. Characters like Damon Runyon's Dave the Dude, 
Harry the Horse and Black Mike Marrio were all too common. Said

Chapter XXI 
225 
Arthur, "We took cuts out of large pots and were doing well. Until, 
one night, six thugs with 'heaters' appeared, and Ken and I decided 
to get out of the poker business." 
Looking back at how Arthur lived in those days, I am amazed 
that this naive and friendly Westerner survived at all, let alone be­
came a great master. For in addition to the fine qualities mentioned 
already-so inimical to survival in the street canyons of Manhat­
tan-my friend was generous to a fault. If he had only a quarter to 
his name, he was willing to go halves with another in similar need. 
But don't get me wrong. For all his generosity, Arthur was a 
mensch, not a milquetoast. At age 16, he shipped out as an appren­
tice seaman aboard the S.S. Bearport bound for Shanghai. "I was a 
self-styled Jack London," said Arthur. 
Shanghai in 1926! It was the most wide-open city in the history 
of the world, and my friend learned all about life and a kind of love 
in that fascinating cesspool of squalor and taxi girls. In 1929, Arthur 
picked up some more pointers in a Sochi nightclub from a leggy 
Russian dancer, whose officer boyfriend kept patting his leather 
pistol holster. Another lesson came one afternoon aboard ship when 
Arthur fought a four-round boxing match against a tough Filipino. 
"We hated each other's guts," Arthur grins, "but after half killing 
ourselves became close friends!" 
That's the way Arthur was-a two-fisted guy in chess and life 
who, nonetheless, never had a mean thought. He may have lived on 
grapes, but I warrant that they never tasted bitter in his mouth. 
They were grapes of the vine, not of wrath. 
A Speed Demon 
That Arthur could squash Alekhine in speed chess ought to surprise 
only youngsters under 75. For the young Oregonian was a speed 
demon. A typical victory was a 12-0 rout in September 1935, of a 
field that included Fine, Horowitz, Sammy Reshevsky, yours truly 
and virtually every other top American master. 
Arthur had a lot of Bobby Fischer in him. There was the same 
meteoric rise, and having analyzed with both of them, I can say the 
same gift for summing up positions quickly based largely on intui­
tion. Neither man had to plod through lengthy variations to find 
good moves, and both men made chess look easy by the speed with 
which they played. Like the young Viswanathan Anand of the cur­
rent day, Dake and Fischer played entire tournament games in a few 
minutes. That is the good news about Arthur's play. 
The bad news is that this natural genius, like nature itself, had

226 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
the attention span of a hummingbird, a common failing in brilliant 
minds that are untamed by formal intellectual training. Arthur 
never studied chess in a disciplined fashion, never slowed down long 
enough to record analysis for future reference (there was always a 
game going somewhere, and Arthur had to be there!) and never 
adopted a sane tournament regimen. So often in his career, Arthur 
started tournaments with a string of wins and ended them with a 
skein of losses from trying for victory in drawn positions. On one 
occasion, he had Jose Capablanca within a move of resignation but 
cockily played as quickly as the famous Cuban. And lost. What did 
not come easily for Arthur, often came not at all. 
Arthur's opening repertoire was modern even by today's stan­
dards. He played the English because of its positional nature and 
the Sicilian because it was still relatively unhooked. None of us 
feared his opening play, but we dreaded his handling of endgames, 
the classic preserve of the natural player. His opponent in the fol­
lowing game described Dake's performance as "wizardry":

About this move, the amazed loser wrote, "I considered my 
chances very good, since Black's Queenside pawns are on the same 
colored squares as my Bishop. But what Dake does with his Knight 
is sheer magic, surely one of the finest played endgames in the lit­
erature of chess."

After Arthur won the Marshall Chess Club championship in 193 1, 
he climbed America's chess ladder at a dizzying pace. Shortly fol­
lowing the Prague Olympiad of that same year, he tied for first with 
Akiba Rubinstein and F.D. Yates at Antwerp; finished third with 
Fine at Syracuse 1934; tallied 11-1 to tie with Fine and Herman 
Steiner for first at Mexico City 1934-35; etc. etc. But he made his 
real mark at the three Olympiads in which he represented the 
United States. His overall result of 75.6 percent ( +27 -4 =14) is 
second among American players only to that of Issac Kashdan. 
At the Warsaw Olympiad of 1935, Arthur scored +13 -0 =5 to 
turn in the best single result of that event. "I was visiting the coun­
try of my heritage," Arthur once said, "and touched all the right 
pieces." As a special prize, the Polish-American hero received a valu­
able painting of Polish rural life by the artist Wasilewski. "But it was 
on the ship trip back aboard the S.S. Pilsudski," Arthur often says, 
"that I won my most wonderful chess prize-my wife, Helen." 
The couple were wed in November 1935, and although Arthur 
and Helen crisscrossed the country on a series of simultaneous tours 
(with Arthur achieving in Milwaukee a career-best simul score of 
+ 71 -0 =1), the energy and the money began to dwindle. Arthur 
taught chess in the Milwaukee public schools in 1936-37. He was 
part of a program promoted by Arpad Elo of later ratings fame.

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
In April 1937, Arthur's daughter, Marjorie, was born. Shortly 
thereafter, his chess career died. He would not play seriously again 
until the Lone Pine tournament of 1973, following his retirement as 
a supervisor at Oregon's Department of Motor Vehicles. Here was 
the kind of play that the chess world lost for 35 years:

But Black is surely dead after this move? Note that White loses

Righting the Wrong 
Somehow, in the awards shuffle of the early 1950s, Arthur got dealt 
out of a grandmaster title. Don't ask me why. Here was a master 
who had an equal or plus score against every leading American play­
er except Reshevsky. Against Fine, Arthur scored 7 wins, 7 losses 
and 8 draws; against Kashdan, 1 win and 6 draws; against Steiner, 5 
wins, 2 losses, 3 draws; and so on. "The failure to recognize him as a 
grandmaster," wrote Walter Korn in America's Chess Heritage, "re­
flected on the system, not on the person." 
Arthur proved Korn's point beyond argument when at Lone Pine 
in 1974 and 1976, he finished ahead of such strong young players as 
Larry Christiansen, John Fedorowicz and Yasser Seirawan. Several 
youngsters, who wondered if this unknown old geezer could take a 
punch, found themselves wondering what hit them. Among his 
victims in the 1976 fixture was Ken Rogoff, a young comer who had 
finished second a year earlier in the U.S. Championship.

good thing, I could point in reply to righting the wrong done t o  
Arthur Dake. In 1986, I was able to convince FIDE to award this 
great player the GM title for his many fine performances during the 
1930s. 
From time to time I run into my friend at tournaments. He is a 
good deal older and slower than the young chess speedster of yes­
teryear, who used to quip, "I'll dake it off," during lightning games. 
But he is otherwise unchanged-still childlike in his friendliness, 
still generous to a fault and still ambitious in chess. In 1991, he was 
inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame. 
Thus I give you Arthur William Dake, a decent and considerate 
spirit, and an American original if ever there was one. I look forward 
to meeting with him for many years to come. 
Helen Dake, Arthur's wife of 58 years, has just died. In a moving 
memorial in the July 1994 Chess Life, my friend wrote about his 
loss and about what he values in life: 
At the 1935 Warsaw Olympiad, I scored 15112-21!2 to post the 
best absolute result of that event; and I can still remember 
thinking during the trip back aboard the S.S. Pilsudski that 
the greatest chess prize of my life was a famous painting of 
Polish rural life that I had just received. 
That's when I met 26-year-old Helen Gerwatowski during the 
intermission of a shipboard movie. Helen, who was returning 
to America after visiting her ancestral Poland, simply turned 
around and smiled at me. That's all. 
Some six weeks later, after a whirlwind romance, we married 
on November 14, 1935. And this remarkable person, who was 
truly my most wonderful chess prize, became my wife for 5 8  
years until her death on April 1, 1994. 
Let me tell you about my Helen. She was a lady who unfail­
ingly prayed the rosary every morning, who never failed to 
say "I love you" every evening; who supported me in my ef­
forts to become a chess professional during the Depression 
'30s; who baked celebrated lemon meringue pies for the Altar 
Society and Oregon blueberry muffins for a former Chess Life 
editor and good friend [Larry Parr] ; who travelled to Rome, 
Paris, and Poland, thanks to the generosity of our daughter 
Marjorie; and who passed away, fittingly, on Good Friday 
with a palm-leaf crucifix in her hand. 
I fell in love with Helen at first sight, but I never imagined 
back then that like a flower in perpetual unfolding, Helen

232 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
would reveal over the years an ever-more textured human 
soul that somehow grew in generosity and faith in Our Lord. 
For me, Helen was an ever-evolving wonderment of strength 
and wisdom; for others, she proved that by working in the 
shipyards during World War II and at Hartford Insurance for 
the ensuing 20 years, one could be a normal, healthy person 
yet also be fully alive. 
My Helen, who for so many decades bravely played the role 
of a "chess widow," has now left me a chess widower. I grieve 
the loss of my mate of a lifetime.

Chapter XXI I 
Mol'e 01'er, 1/alentino! 
The first time that I saw boyish, handsome Herman Steiner was in 
the early 1930s at the Manhattan Chess Club, where he was playing 
a match against Reuben Fine. He lost narrowly. 
The impression that Herman made was striking-a one-time 
boxer, he was well built in a wiry way. But this impression was also 
fleeting. I did not really get to know him until years later when we 
were both playing in the 1934 Syracuse International. I had agreed 
to share a room with Sammy Reshevsky, blithely unaware of his 
special wakeup alarm system. And the very first morning, Sammy 
shattered my dreams with the loudest wailing and lamentations that 
I had ever heard. He was praying. 
"Stop complaining and go back to bed," I said. 
"Don't you realize we've lost the Temple?" he mumbled. 
That was more than I could take, and later the same day, I 
moved across the hall to Herman's room. There, the attack on my 
sleep was of a different kind. Thinking back across the decades, I 
still have not decided which would have been better for my chess: 
staying with Sammy and losing some sleep, or hanging out with 
Herman and getting practically no sleep at all while learning all 
about life and ladies. 
You may talk about the Valentinos and Navarros, but they had 
nothing on the man whom we would later call Handsome Herman 
of Hollywood. He was one charming devil with a disarming smile 
and a twinkle in the eye that women could not resist. The most 
beautiful women imaginable literally fought just to share him. I had 
never seen the like and did not complain because it permitted me to 
enjoy the overflow. Herman, wherever you are, I want you to know 
that I will always be grateful. 
Admittedly, however, I exhibited no such gratitude at the time 
in our individual game, which is given here because it was our first 
tournament battle and set the tone of future encounters.

What happened in the tournament to early-to-bed, early-to-rise 
Sammy Reshevsky? While Herman and this grasshopper were out 
partying (was this the tournament where Herman and I came back 
at 4 a.m. with a parking sign and put it in bed with one of our 
sleeping friends?), Sammy gathered points like rosebuds to win the 
Syracuse event easily with a score of 12-2. 
A Child of Nature 
"Herman," my good friend Al Horowitz once said, "has the body of 
a grown man and the uncontrollable spirit of a young stallion." 
Right, but I don't think that even Al knew how apt the description 
was. Herman was a child of nature, warm and friendly as a lap dog 
and totally spontaneous and uninhibited. No matter how tight a 
spot he squeezed himself into, he always wiggled out thanks to his 
boyish and buoyant enthusiasm. 
Horowitz used to tell the story of how Herman, during an Olym­
piad game, once touched the wrong piece and was forced to move 
it. He jumped up from the table, rushed about the room gesturing 
with the guilty finger, and screamed, "Fingerfehler! Ich habe einen 
Fingerfehler gemacht." That was Herman to a "T." 
Herman's perky ways did not always sit well with his chess. Of 
course, he was an outstanding master, winning the U.S. Open twice, 
representing the United States at four Olympiads (scoring well at 
the Hague 1928 and Prague 1931), and racking up two or three 
excellent international results such as first at Berlin 1931 (ahead of 
Ludwig Rellstab, Fritz Saemisch and Lajos Steiner), second at Brno 
1932 Uust behind Salo Flohr) and third at Pasadena 1932 (tied with 
Reshevsky and Arthur Dake). But too often he was as irrepressible 
over the board as away from it. 
Herman probably holds the all-time record for playing Rook lifts 
to the third rank with the intention of sliding the piece over to the 
Kingside. Most of us understood what he had in mind and countered 
victoriously on the Queen's wing. For a drastic example of Herman's 
singleminded approach, turn elsewhere in these pages to "Starry 
Knights in Hollywood," which contains the first game of my 1946 
match with Herman. 
Still, Herman's style made for fascinating if not always winning 
chess. One of the tournament books about the 1952 Stockholm 
Interzonal had as much space devoted to Herman's games as to 
those of Alexander Kotov, who won that event by three points. 
Herman scored only 50 percent at Stockholm, but he kicked up 
plenty of dust even in defeat.

Chapter XXII

On those occasions when Herman curbed his drastic ebullience, 
usually when representing the United States in international team 
matches, he played formidably. In the U.S.A.-U.S.S.R. Radio Match 
of 1945, a 10-board affair, Herman was the only American to make 
a plus score, defeating Igor Bondarevsky on board six, 1%-Ifz.

Hot Hollywood Hunk 
In 1932, at age 27, Handsome Herman headed west to California. In 
July 1933, he took over the chess column in the Los Angeles 
Times, which he would edit until his premature death in 1955. 
If Southern California were a chess desert when Herman arrived,

Chapter XXII 
241 
he soon transformed it into an oasis. He opened a club at 108 North 
Formosa Avenue, his celebrated Hollywood Chess Group, and at­
tracted such famous students as Humphrey Bogart, Louis Hayward, 
Margaret Sullavan and Billy Wilder. Others who might happen by on 
those warm, lotus evenings in Old Hollywood included the likes of 
film greats Lauren Bacall, John Barrymore, Charles Boyer, Myrna 
Loy and the breathtaking Linda Darnell, whom Reuben Fine de­
scribed as the most beautiful woman he ever saw. 
Herman had found heaven as the hot Hollywood hunk of chess. 
He married a concert pianist named Selma and sired two sons, 
Eugene and Armin. They lived in a large and tastefully appointed 
home, a wedding present from Selma's mother, that also housed the 
Hollywood Chess Group. Of course, as a master of the attack, he 
continued to check out and mate numerous budding starlets 
seeking the favor of someone who 
knew 
the famous actor 
Humphrey Bogart or the mega-mogul Billy Wilder. 
Where women were concerned, Herman broke bread with the 
poet Richard Armour: "I am not very covetous,/! do not crave a 
lot./The things I want are limited/To what I haven't got." 
And if Herman loved Hollywood and its pulchritudinous attrac­
tions, his love was returned. That Steiner charm worked wonders, 
and many of the golden women and powerful men of Old Holly­
wood helped him to promote chess by working the royal game into 
movies and press releases. On the set, Herman could get away with 
just about anything, including flirting with leading ladies. During 
the filming of Cass Timberlane, he told Lana Turner, "Don't play 
chess. Sitting at a chess board for hours might make you fat and 
spoil that perfect figure." 
Herman's many friends even found bit parts for him in their films. 
One of Herman's more prominent roles was as Adolf Hitler, whom 
he certainly resembled after pasting down his shiny black hair and 
clipping his mustache. 
uThe Goal of My Ambition" 
Don't get me wrong. Handsome Herman may have been a playboy, 
but he remained first of all a man of chess. More than anything else, 
he longed to become United States chess champion, which he once 
described as "the goal of my ambition." After his greatest interna­
tional triumph, first prize in the London "Victory" International of 
1946, he challenged me to a match for the national title that I had 
won in 1944. 
I accepted readily. Not only was the $5,000 purse munificent by 
the standards of the mid-1940s, but I had no reason to believe that

242 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
the pattern of our previous results, beginning with the above Syra­
cuse game of 1934, would alter in the proposed 10-game match. 
I was right and won 6-4. The story of that match, which took 
place in Los Angeles in May 1946, can be found in Chapter IX. My 
purpose here is merely to report that I was not guilty of wounding 
Herman's spirit. Always an incorrigible optimist, he attributed his 
loss to the strain of raising funds and issued another challenge for 
the following year. But as luck or skill would have it, I lost my title 
in the fall of 1946. Sammy Reshevsky scored a lopsided result of 
16-2 in that year's championship. 'Nuff said. 
Herman's championship quest eventually succeeded. In 1948, he 
topped a 20-player field that included Isaac Kashdan to cop the 
title. It must have been a sweet victory. Certainly it was richly 
deserved. And what gave Herman considerable satisfaction was to 
win the championship by playing chess his way.

One day in late November 1955, during that year's California 
State Championship, Herman felt ill. He called a doctor, who visited 
him at his home. During the examination, Herman died of a heart 
attack. It was the end of a journey that began only 50 years earlier 
in Hungary-a journey that took him first to New York and inter­
national chess fame, and then to Old Hollywood where this man­
child stopped living before growing old.

disputed by Steiner for reasons that are today unclear. The match referee 
eventually ruled in Fine's favor, though not before ordering the two young

outgrow this style, whereas Fine would become the ultimate smoothie.

Chapter XXI I I  
$or George 'freysman 
the cFay Was the 'fhing 
"You castle your way, and I'll castle my way .... " 
-George N. Treysman 
In 1928, at the age of 14, I was accepted as a junior member of the 
Manhattan Chess Club, which in those days occupied the entire 
ground floor of the Sherman Square Hotel on 71st and Broadway. 
Everything about the Manhattan was structured and ordered, 
even to how members should behave and dress. One advertisement 
for the institution read, "A Club for Gentlemen of Discernment who 
Enjoy the Royal Game." If the club secretary, L. Walter Stephens, 
frowned at you, it was because you failed to pass muster. "Young 
man," he would announce in his best Princeton accent, "you are 
improperly accoutered." 
Given this sheltered upbringing in chess, the reader may imagine 
my astonishment when years later I visited the Stuyvesant Chess 
Club, an absolutely unique institution of a kind unfortunately gone 
forever. The Stuyvesant, which was located on New York's lower 
East Side at 14th Street just west of Second Avenue, was a com­
pletely different world, filled with people who would rather play 
chess than eat. It was as if I had crossed some unseen border and 
wandered into a foreign land. Here few people spoke English, and 
most conversations were in Russian, Yiddish or Polish. It was a good 
thing for me that chess is a universal language. 
In the Bohemian atmosphere of the Stuyvesant, there were no 
restrictions on noise; and people wore what they felt comfortable in 
or what they could afford. You could hear shouted epithets such as 
"dummkopf!", "patzer!", "pfuscher!", "schlemiel!" and so on. 
Everyone was a chain smoker. The fumes were, as Norman Lessing 
has written, "thick enough to cut in chunks." The smoke reminded 
me of a Holmesian London fog, and the light bulbs with their green 
mandarin-hat shades above the tables resembled street lamps vainly 
251

252 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
attempting to pierce the miasma. The place was usually packed. 
The club consisted of a long loft in an old brownstone, half a 
story above street level. There were chess tables out front, card 
tables to the rear and still further back a small kitchen whence 
emanated coffee, tea and sandwiches-all served at the chess tables 
so as not to disturb games in progress. 
The host, Jacob "Yankele" Bernstein, was short, fat and greasy­
looking, in addition to being completely bald and having a neck like 
a wrestler's. Happily married to Anna Casement, a plump woman 
with a last name that still echoes loudly in Irish history, he wore a 
perpetual grin on his face and was usually friendly and pleasant. The 
exception was when someone walked out without paying a bill-a 
practice that he nonetheless tolerated. He loved chess people and 
was quite a strong player. It was said that Yankele could not have 
paid his own bills were it not for the poker games that he cut on the 
second floor, directly below his own quarters on the third. 
That he ran a gambling parlor-right beneath the night sticks of 
his wife's numerous brothers and cousins on the police force-was 
proven when the cops raided the club and hauled him into court. 
Luckily for Yankele, the judge was a chess player who asked, "If 
yours is not a gambling establishment, then tell me, 'Who is the U.S. 
chess champion?"' 
"Arnold Denker!" replied Yankele, and the case was immediately 
dismissed. 
Yankele never reformed himself. He was too easy-going for the 
conventional world. One story has him asking a question at a 
Wilson-for-President rally: "Mr. Wilson, is it true that if you're 
elected, every man will have work?" When Wilson answered yes, 
Yankele protested, "But Mr. Wilson, I don't want to work. I'm a 
gambler." 
uKing of the Put Down" 
I visited the Stuyvesant Chess Club many times over the years and 
got to know some very interesting characters. One of them was 
George Nelson Treysman, the "King of the Put Down" and the self­
proclaimed ruler of chess on Manhattan's East Side. 
A one-time waiter with a penchant for spilling soup on customers 
whom he disliked, George soon found it necessary to earn his living 
at chess. Medium in height, gaunt and emaciated-looking with high, 
knobby cheekbones, Treysman's face resembled the death mask of a 
Mongol warrior. The single redeeming feature was his eyes. They 
were deep-set, like two black coals resting in a pool of water, and

Chapter XXII 
253 
when he laughed they fairly rippled and overflowed until tears 
streamed down his cheeks. 
Treysman could have been a fine actor, since he had just the 
right amount of ham in him. There were times when he would feign 
royalty, and he carried it off so well that I think he began to believe 
it. Once, when I inquired about his background, he twirled his ever­
present white shawl about his neck in a single sweeping motion and 
replied, "Don't you honestly feel that you are in the presence of 
nobility when you are in my company?" 
Although Treysman never cracked a chess book and played in no 
more than a half-dozen tournaments, he had a natural talent so 
great that he could hold his own with the best. Were it not for his 
heavy smoking, poor diet and totally undisciplined lifestyle, he 
might have gone far. At age 55 and well past his prime, he finished 
third in what was the first master tournament of his life-the 1936 
U.S. Championship!

Treysman's years in coffeehouses, spent grinding out games day 
in and day out, provided him with an excellent technique, which he 
demonstrated in this struggle. 
George never gave tournament chess more than a passing doff of 
the cap. Except in 1936. In that year he not only came within one 
or two moves of winning the U.S. Championship, he also went 32 
games without defeat-a skein that began with the Rice-Progressive 
Chess Club Championship, continued through an arduous qualifying 
tournament for the U.S. Championship finals, and ended in round 
10 of those finals when a very weary Treysman played a ghastly 
game against my friend, AI "Buddy" Simonson. 
The Odds-On Favorite 
As an odds-giver Treysman was the king. He had no peer, not even 
the great AI Horowitz. Indeed, George had to be tops just to sur­
vive. Knowing his strength, players would haggle with him and 
demand outrageous odds for risking their money. He would usually 
agree-but not before insulting his prospective opponent for de­
manding such an unfair advantage. All the while he knew that he 
was going to play, but he wanted the opponent to feel that he had 
driven a hard bargain. When first witnessing this performance, I was 
truly shocked, not realizing that it was merely a ritual like the 
mating ceremony of storks to establish dominance.

Chapter XXll 
255 
In The World of Chess, Anthony Saidy and Norman Lessing de­
scribe the course of a typical Treysman hustle: 
George would approach his prey courteously enough. "Would 
you care for a game of chess, sir?" 
This usually produced a wary response. "Chess? No, I don't 
think so." 
"Pinochle, maybe? Clabriash?" 
"Not interested." 
"Casino, dominoes? Maybe you'd like to shoot a game of 
pool? They got a nice pool hall across the street." The 
customer would try to wave him off but George was a hard 
man to shake. "Ping-Pong, tiddlywinks? What's your best 
game? I'll play you anything you want and give you odds, 
that's how much I think of you." 
By this time the man was angry. "Okay, I'll play you chess. 
What odds will you give me?" 
Then the game would begin. George was a master of psycho­
logical warfare. With the saddest expression in the world, he would 
look out into the ever-present audience and wail, "You see, this is 
the kind of low-life that I have to put up with in order to live." 
Other times, he would belittle an opponent's move by pointing out 
its threat to the kibitzers. "Look how crude and low his plan is," he 
would say. Then he would make a move and extoll the beauty and 
artistry of his own play. Of course, he always neglected to point out 
the real threat behind his move, which was far different from what 
he revealed to the onlookers. And when an opponent finally grab­
bed the bait, he would finish him off and ask, "How can you be 
such an idiot to believe everything that people tell you?" 
A good question. Yet idiots were never wanting. 
Take Jack Richman, the owner of a Lower East Side delicatessen, 
a happily married family man, and model material for one of those 
manic Manhattan melodramas. You see, Jack caught the chess bug, 
an affliction absolutely fatal to family life and financial limb back in 
the 1930s and 1940s. 
Jack and George soon developed a relationship based on negative 
symbiosis. Jack worked all day at his delicatessen, played blitz 
chess all night against George at the Stuyvesant, and returned to 
work in the morning with neither sleep nor the previous day's 
receipts. George was no better off. He too went sleepless by taking 
his winnings to the race track and then losing them.

Daorge's pocket 
After losing business, wife, children and home, Jack took up 
residence on 42nd Street where he sat shoulder-to-shoulder with 
George in all weather, hustling the "suckahs" for quarters. Dressed 
always in two complete suits, Jack said that the inner garments 
were his weekday wear, the outer apparel his Sunday best and that 
he wore both because he could not decide which he liked better. 
When cadging smokes, Jack would invariably ask in his thick Noi 
Yawk accent, "Hey, ya got a Shysterfield?" Unfortunately for Jack, 
I was a confirmed Camel man, having appeared in nationally pub­
lished cigarette advertisements. 
By the mid-1950s both men were going downhill fast, holing up 
near Times Square at the New York Chess & Checkers Club or, as 
we called it, the flea house. One day, George and a young Allen 
Kaufman, who is nowadays the distinguished executive director of 
the tony American Chess Foundation, were swapping news when a 
ratty-looking Richman slouched in. 
"See that guy," George rasped like someone suffering from throat 
cancer, "I made him into a chessplayer!" By which he meant that 
he had ruined his life. And when looking at Jack, you couldn't help 
thinking about the words of the writer who moaned, "I am not 
actually unhappy; it is something worse than that." 
Unlike George, Jack had a softer side. True, he would malevo­
lently tell opponents to "Break a leg!", which he rendered into his 
imprecise Yiddish as "Brach a jass!" or "Break a foot! "  Yet when 
confronted with a gratuitous kindness that even his suspicious mind 
could not fault, he would say, "Brach nicht kein foss!" or "Don't 
break a foot! "  
George's coffeehouse games do not survive. Certainly, he played 
extremely aggressively in these sporting contests and sought tactical 
complications relentlessly. The pay, after all, was the thing. The 
following tournament games, in which the opposition was well 
below Treysman's level, give a fair idea of his coffeehouse play:

Doing It His Way 
To play successfully at odds required more than attacking tech­
nique; it required quick-witted chutzpah. On one memorable occa­
sion, George was extending Queen odds to an opponent just a bit 
too strong for such an overwhelming advantage. So he devised a 
new way of castling by which he put his Rook immediately on Kl . 
The adversary scratched his head and inquired how it was that 
when he castled, his Rook ended up on the Bishop's square, and 
when George castled, it ended up on the King's square. To which 
George replied, "You castle your way, and I'll castle my way, 
okay?" 
"Okay," agreed the patzer. 
Another Treysman technique for confusing the opponent and 
saving precious seconds in time pressure was to grab a salt or pepper 
shaker when queening a pawn. "I'm not a cheater!" George would 
exclaim indignantly. "Don't I always take the salt shaker when 
White and the pepper when Black?" 
Sometimes, when all else failed, George would lean across the 
table and lower his voice to a confidential tone. "Do you realize," 
he would ask, "that you are matched against the founder of the 
Treysmanic School of Chess?" To this day I have yet to .discover 
what or where that school was, but it sure had the power to 
intimidate. 
For the spectators, the show was great. For his opponents, it was 
quite another matter. George was fond of singing songs as he 
played, and he always hit his best rhythm when a win was within 
reach. There was the tender favorite, "Who Hit Nelly in the Belly 
with a Flounder?"; and he simply loved another song with a refrain

Chapter XXII 
259 
which went, "They call me Shirley just because my hair is curly." 
But my favorite was "In Spain, they say, the chess reigns plainly in 
the main." 
Treysman rarely played against equals. His greatest joy came 
from giving odds and insulting his opponents. It was said that he 
could curse in seven languages, though he always did so with a 
smile. 
George led a lonely and, at the end, a depressing life. In his final 
years before dying of throat cancer in 1959, he was reduced to 
sitting mute at the chessboard and to writing out insults on a 
scratchpad. This veteran gamesman, his ravaged neck wrapped in 
discolored gauze, expected no pity and received none. 
Looking back across the decades, dozens of pictures flash before 
my eyes of George hustling chess. But for some reason, I often fix 
on the night that he was playing Charles Jaffe, who had once been a 
leading player (he defeated Capablanca in a tournament game) and 
who was by that time a sickly old man. Jaffe, who made some 
money publishing works in Yiddish, had a bad game, and George 
was riding him hard. When he threatened to tear Jaffe limb from 
limb and to feed him to the crocodiles, the latter stood up and sent 
all the pieces flying across the table and stomped out. 
Not to be upstaged, George looked around, spread out his palms 
in an elaborate shrug, and asked with the most innocent tone and 
face in the world, "What kind of variation is that for a nice Yiddish 
writer?"

Stormin' JVorman: 
Caissa 's Con man 
I'm an honest man. I follow the rules and believe that the rules are 
to be followed. So it was quite a surprise to answer the doorbell one 
afternoon in 1944, shortly after winning the U.S. Chess Champion­
ship, and to find two burly FBI men who wanted to question me. 
Their visit had to do with Norman Tweed Whitaker, a man whom 
I had met several years before, when I was in my early twenties. At 
that time I was staying in Chevy Chase with my dear friend Isaac 
"Izzy" Turover, a professional chess player turned successful Wash­
ington, D.C., lumber dealer. My purpose for being in the area was to 
give a series of exhibitions and lectures. I met Whitaker after my 
first local simul, and we hit it off immediately. 
A scion of a socially prominent Philadelphia family, Norman 
seemed sprinkled with gold dust. His father, Herbert Whitaker, was 
a noted mathematics teacher, while his mother enjoyed repute as a 
champion whist player. At one of Philadelphia's outstanding high 
schools, he served as president of the student senate, vice president 
of his class (1908), president of the engineering club, vice president 
of the debating society, president of Phi Sigma fraternity and, to be 
sure, president of the chess club. 
Yet Whitaker was not particularly attractive. Born in 1890, he 
was about five feet nine and rather stocky at 180 pounds. His 
complexion was ruddy, and his light brown hair was chopped to a 
crew cut. One would hardly give him a second look. But when he 
smiled, his whole face lit up. And his eyes-they fairly spoke to 
you. His manners were those of a Southern gentleman, and when 
alone with you, he spoke with so much enthusiasm that he just 
carried you along. Further, he had the benefit of a fine education at 
Georgetown and Oxford, the personal presence of a man who once 
wielded power (he served as an Assistant Secretary of the Interior 
during the Teapot Dome scandal of 1922), and the intellectual self­
assurance of an outstanding scholar of German literature. When he 
turned on the charm, he made you feel as if you were the only 
262

person in the whole wide world who really mattered. 
No wonder that I was completely fascinated by Norman. We 
dined together at the very finest restaurants, and he even intro­
duced me to one of his favorite pastimes, the Sport of Kings. We 
also played a lot of chess, and during the two weeks that we spent 
together in 1935, I was able to see why he had won the Western 
Open, which is today known as the U.S. Open, in 1923 and 1927 
and why he owned a 2-1 record against Sammy Reshevsky.

Stormin' Norman played a hard, attacking game that was as short 
on subtlety as his so-called Whitaker Gambit (1. P-K4 P-K3 2. P-Q4 
P-Q4 3. B-K3). His finest achievement was clear second at the 
Eighth American Chess Congress, played in July 1921. He scored 8-
3 to finish a half point behind David Janowski, whom he defeated in 
their individual game. In that tournament, he also beat Frank 
Marshall, who trailed badly at 6-5. Other successes included a 
match victory over Jackson Showalter in 1918 and a drawn match 
with Fritz Saemisch in 1960. Together with Glenn Hartleb, he 
authored 365 Selected Endings (1960), a superb collection that is 
written in both English and German. 
Norman could trade tactical blows with the best of them, as is 
demonstrated in the game below against Marshall. Just take a gan­
der at the pretzel-like position following 27 . . . .  R-KBl.

Norman's forte in chess and, as we shall see, in life was rough-and­

even as he grew older retained a puncher's chances in individual 
games against the very best. At age 61, he dismembered Isaac 
Kashdan (White) in the following little-known game from the 19 5 1

Norman and Gaston 
Strange to say, one thing did bother me about Norman. How could 
he always be so well-dressed and spend so much money without 
working? In the end I convinced myself that he had inherited a 
fortune. By the time I left Washington, D.C., we were good friends. 
Yet it was the last time that our paths crossed. Over the years he 
sent me postcards with interesting positions from his games, and he 
occasionally dispatched a congratulatory telegram about something 
I did. It was just such a message that brought those two husky FBI 
gentlemen to my door on that sunny afternoon in 1944. 
They had been tailing Norman for some time. He had given them 
the slip, and I was suddenly their hottest lead. Their goal was to 
find out where he and a confederate, Gaston Means, hid $100,000 
(about a million crisp ones in today's dollars) that they received 12 
years earlier from the wealthy socialite and Washington Post co­
publisher, Evalyn Walsh McLean. Mrs. McLean thought she was pro­
viding them with ransom money for the kidnapped Lindbergh baby. 
Years later Norman would maintain steadfastly that for good and 
honest reasons this money was handed over to three strangers at the 
Highway Bridge entrance to Washington, D.C. Few people believed 
him, and in the press Norman was called "The Fox." 
Mrs. McLean's lettuce was never recovered despite years of inten­
sive searching. Whitaker served time on Alcatraz Island. He stood up 
to it in good style and could even be witty about this episode in his 
life. As he once noted, he robbed only the rich because there was so 
little to be had from the poor. "Anyway," as he put it, "there would 
be no sense of achievement." He took pride that some of his frauds 
made the textbooks. 
The Lindbergh fraud was still better. It made the front pages. For 
weeks, Norman and Gaston Means, a paunchy ex-Justice Depart­
ment agent and a bag man for bigwigs in the bribe-ridden Harding 
administration, basked in the notoriety of being this nation's most 
callous cads. 
Headlines in the New York Times from May 1933 read, "Means 
and Whitaker on Trial in Capital"; "Washington Court Is Thronged 
as Flier [Charles Lindbergh] Testifies in Means and Whitaker Case"; 
"Whitaker Is Also Found Guilty of Plot to Mulct Mrs. McLean in 
Lindbergh Case." And so on. No wonder that years later, when Nor­
man used to visit the offices of Chess Review, Al Horowitz would 
roar, "Come on in, Norman, and pull up an electric chair!" 
The era of Bonnie and Clyde was also the time of Norman and 
Gaston. I do not know much about the road Mr. Means travelled to 
reach the apex of infamy, but I can trace Norman's trail from

266 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Georgetown Law School graduate and Washington, D.C. patent 
attorney to supposed chief kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby and 
criminal louse. 
In 1916 Norman was practicing law in Washington, and America 
had yet to enter World War I. Whatever views he had about Woo­
drow Wilson's decision in April 1917 to involve America in the war, 
Norman was determined to remain at peace. According to records at 
the Bureau of Investigation, the forerunner of the FBI, he moved 
from state to state, animated by the noble desire to keep ahead of 
draft notices. Only on November 16, 1918, five days after the war 
ended, did Norman appear at Fort Dix, New Jersey, to serve one day 
before being discharged for "defective vision." 
In November 1921, Norman and brother Roland, plus sisters 
Dorothy and Hazel Whitaker, were arrested for violating the Dyer 
Act that banned transport of stolen cars across state lines. The 
Whitakers had latched on to the family values issue over seven 
decades before Dan Quayle and Bill Clinton; the four were saying 
via concrete deed that an upper-middle-class family that steals to­
gether stays together, albeit under lock and key. 
Their racket, as described in the New York Times of February 
26, 1922, involved "a nationwide plot to recover insurance on auto­
mobiles claimed to have been stolen and transported from one State 
to another." Although disbarred in 1924, Norman kept the courts at 
bay on the criminal counts for nearly four years. But on July 16, 
1925, the Times reported that Norman had left Philadelphia the 
day before to serve two years at Leavenworth, "chained to United 
States Deputy Marshal Knox." 
There followed an episode of comic relief. 
On December 5, 1930, local police arrested Norman in Pleasant­
vale, New Jersey, for putting slugs in a pay telephone! A bit later, he 
played the role of chief of the Soviet secret police in America to 
peddle phony secrets to one Ralph Easley, head of the anti-Com­
munist National Civic Federation. He raked in a tidy 20 G's for that 
scam-or about a quarter million in today's so-called currency.

the 
18-month-old 
Lindbergh baby from the famous aviator's estate near Hopewell, 
New Jersey. That same month, Norman was found guilty in Tampa, 
Florida, on a charge similar to his earlier Dyer Act conviction. Out 
on appeal, he jumped bail and headed north to cash in on the agony 
of the Lindberghs. Time was of the essence because the baby could 
turn up any moment, alive or dead. (And as it happened, dead.

Chapter XXIV 
267 
Colonel Lindbergh identified the remains-fractured skull and all­
on May 13, 1932.) 
Norman and Gaston teamed up. The latter, claiming to be a go­
between who was merely extending his good offices, had already se­
cured $100,000 in ransom money from Mrs. McLean. That was in 
March 1932. Norman then played the role of chief kidnapper in a 
second scam to squeeze an additional $35,000 from the lady. Intro­
duced to Mrs. McLean at her South Carolina vacation home as "a 
dangerous killer" known as "The Fox," Norman lived up to his bil­
ling. "His behavior," wrote George Waller in The Story of the Lind­
bergh Case, "was quite in character for an underworld boss. His 
eyes shifted continuously, surveying the room. Then he insisted on 
examining the entire house . . .  searching for hidden microphones." In 
the style of Edward G. Robinson, Norman threatened to machine­
gun the thrilled society matron in the event of a double cross. 
Candor compels me to admit that Norman and Gaston did not 
have to play a grandmaster combination to dupe Mrs. McLean. For 
by all accounts, this socialite, who owned the midnight-blue Hope 
diamond and the 921f2 carat Star of the East, also owned an unrated 
brain. As David Brinkley writes in his amusing Washington Goes to 
War, "When she [Evalyn] complained to Daddy Walsh that walking 
to school was 'a little trying to my dignity,' he produced for her a 
blue victoria coach drawn by two prancing sorrels and driven by a 
coachman in silk hat and gloves. Said Evalyn, 'My own preference, 
generally, is for show."' 
And a show, after all, is exactly what Norman and Gaston gave 
her. But the two conmen failed to consider the paradox that Mrs. 
McLean's reputation as a dim bulb could accidentally throw light on 
their dark doings. When she asked a friend at the Washington Post 
to help her pawn a two-foot rope of diamonds to raise the $35,000, 
that friend contacted the great lady's attorney. Said Mrs. McLean's 
savior later, "I suspected that Evalyn was in the hands of unscrupu­
lous persons who were endangering her life and her property." 
By late June 1932, Norman sat in a New York City jail waiting to 
be extradited back to Washington, D.C. Described in newspapers as 
"a suave and smiling prisoner" and termed "a mighty cool proposi­
tion" by then police commissioner Mulrooney, Norman managed to 
escape charges of bilking Mrs. McLean of the initial $100,000. He 
faced trial the following May only for the failed conspiracy to de­
fraud the intended victim of an additional $35,000. 
Back in the 1920s and 1930s, villains were nothing if not brazen. 
As Norman boarded the train for Washington, his young wife stood 
at the gate and, as was reported in the Times, "blew kisses in his 
direction." The jury in Washington, however, did not blow kisses; it

268 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
slapped both him and Means in the chops with a two-year sentence. 
And the $100,000? Means told the jury that a man with a red 
lantern stopped him on the aforementioned bridge and whispered 
"Eleven," supposedly a password between Mrs. McLean and himself. 
He thereupon handed over the greenbacks on the assumption that 
she was calling off the ransom deal. Means, who got 15 years for the 
initial successful scam, died in prison. 
Did Norman somehow latch on to the missing money as was 
assumed by those FBI agents who knocked at my door? When 
asked that question back in 1932 by New York City Deputy Police 
Chief John J. Sullivan, our boy answered, "I got none of it. I wish I 
did." 
Too bad that Chief Sullivan, an Irishman with a brogue more 
Hibernian than a dram of the Blushful Hippocrene on St. Patrick's 
Day, did not know chess. He would have realized that a great 
master such as Norman would first make sure of his material com­
pensation before sacrificing a major piece of time in prison. 
Discovered Check 
When Izzy Turover saw how close Norman and I were becoming, he 
warned me about the man. But such were Norman's powers to 
charm that nothing could have made me believe that this kind 
gentleman was a swindler, including Izzy detailing to me one of his 
pet schemes. 
Norman would establish residence in a small town and open a 
good-sized bank account. Next, he became active in civic and 
church affairs. After some months, during which he built up an im­
peccable credit rating, he would buy a new car at the local Cadillac 
agency on a Friday afternoon after the banks closed. He would pay 
by check, and the following day he would drive to a nearby town 
and offer to sell the car for cash. Invariably, the used car dealer 
would alert the Caddy dealer, who would hotfoot it to the nearby 
town with the sheriff in tow. When all the smoke cleared, along 
with the check on the following Monday, Whitaker would be sitting 
pretty with a fine case of false arrest. Most dealers paid big bucks to 
keep the news out of the press. 
As Norman grew older, he spent his summers in Germany, where 
there was a good market for his skills. But despite his brilliance, I 
quite accidentally discovered one occasion when he met his match. 
A case, you might say, of Deutscher Uber Norman. The nemesis was 
Herr Kurt Rattmann, a fine gentleman whose chess bookstore in 
Hamburg is famous. Even Bobby Fischer has been there and mar­
velled at the collection.

Chapter XXIV 
269 
One day Norman came in and immediately ingratiated himself, 
falling madly in love with his host's exquisite taste in books. Soon 
he was lying on the floor of the shop surrounded by some 30 rare 
volumes, insisting that he could not live without them. But, sad to 
say, he had no cash and would give Kurt his personal check. By 
complete coincidence, Rattmann had heard about Norman through 
a German family that he bilked the previous summer. Politely, Kurt 
told Norman that he would be happy to send the books to his 
hotel, where he could surely get his check cashed. 
That was it. The cash never materialized, and Norman left Ham­
burg sans livres. It was one of the rare times that he was bested. 
Another time was in his declining years. You see, confidence men 
tend not to age well because they eventually lose their self-confi­
dence. Their physical presence and charm deteriorate; their manner 
becomes forced and therefore unconvincing; and their scams de­
generate from the stuff of Robbing Hood to the ordure of social pa­
thology. And so, in 1950 at age 60, Norman found himself in 
Moyamensing Prison near Philadelphia, charged with nine counts of 
molesting a 12-year-old girl. 
At some point Norman slipped from being a colorful high-roller 
to being an off-color and failed old man, though as with most bad 
hats, Norman possessed even in his salad days an enormous capacity 
for self-pity. Thus, shortly after being sentenced in the Lindbergh 
case, he sent a "personal and confidential" letter, dated September 
19, 1933, to Arthur Garfield Hays of the American Civil Liberties 
Union. "The Whitakers," he wrote, "reached this country in 1666. I 
am the last of the line, and . . .  I am bitter indeed at the unfairness in 
the U.S. Courts as I daily languish in my 5' x 7' cell in a filthy jail. 
My business, my reputation, and my family have all been ruined 
through the cruelties done me." 
And the cruelties Norman did to the innocent? Well, he just 
could not think in such terms, remaining a notorious trimmer-on 
one occasion in old age, he memorized an eye chart in advance to 
keep his driver's license-until the very end, which came in May 
1975. Suffering from emphysema, Norman died broke and alone, 
closing out his days drearily at the Cobb Memorial Hospital in a 
place called Phoenix City, Alabama. 
As I say, I follow the rules and believe that the rules are to be 
followed. That's because most of us eventually get our just deserts.

U.S. champion, turned out to be the harbinger of two minor chess tragedies 
for Whitaker. First, after notching up eight straight wins in this tournament, he 
could make only a single draw in the final two rounds to finish a half point 
behind Showalter, who scored 9- 1 .  Secondly, emboldened by the above 
brilliancy, Whitaker rashly challenged the "Kentucky Lion" to a match in June 
1 9 1 6, suffering a crushing defeat, + I -6. In 1 9 1 8, however, Whitaker won a 
rematch, +4 -I =3.

Chapter XXV 
cf\_oad to the cf\_apture 
At one time, Joe Noel was one of the best checker players in the 
United States as well as a darn good chess player. This fey, young 
god, who in his beauty and fate reminded me of the doomed British 
officers described by Vera Brittain in Testament of Youth, could 
have been successful at almost anything. Instead, he chose to live by 
his wits, which were considerable, rather than by honest work. 
Blessed with an impish sense of humor, Joe led the life of a 
Greenwich Village bohemian, which was, in fact, what he was. 
Carousing like a gypsy, he gambled and smoked heavily, staying up 
most of the night. Although usually broke, he somehow managed to 
throw some great parties in his single-room Village pad. 
Our paths first crossed in 1932 when he was a sophisticated 24, 
and I a naive 18. I was amazed that despite his dissolute ways­
indeed, probably because of them-Joe was adored by the ladies. 
They literally blossomed when he paid them the slightest attention. 
Some even paid for the privilege of his company, and each in turn 
thought that she might reform him. It was all part of "the enthral­
ling fun of overhauling you," as Professor Henry Higgins would say. 
But Joe proved immune to improvement and remained set on 
self-destruction. He often said that he wanted no more out of life 
than to leave it laughing. Everyone felt that this claim was youthful 
bravado. He was far too intelligent not to realize that he was slowly 
committing suicide. Yet events demonstrated that there was some­
thing inside this man telling him that the world was a big joke-a 
cosmic jest. The real world, man's life after death, was where better 
things awaited all of us. "Only fools take this life seriously" was his 
invariable assertion when we discussed weighty issues. 
If I live long enough, perhaps I will someday understand why so 
many brilliant people entertain such crazy thoughts. 
A Hand with a Tale 
Joe was quite a hand with a tale. He could summon an image to a 
listener's eye by recapturing every detail of a story. I remember his 
275

276 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
account of how he was once stranded in Pittsburgh, Pa., without 
return fare to New York. 
Joe wandered over to the YMCA where rooms were then 35 cents 
a night. While walking through the lounge, he noticed a few chess 
games in progress and learned that a club was holding its weekly 
meeting. He seated himself beside one of the games, kibitzing by 
recommending silly remedies to the player whose position was al­
ready beyond hope. Finally, the loser got up and said, "Look, if you 
can do better, then why don't you tackle him?" 
That's what Joe wanted. Mter all of the stupid suggestions, the 
prospective sucker surely believed that he had a fish on the line. 
They started playing for quarters, and Joe was soon several dollars 
ahead, whereupon the sucker had second thoughts about who really 
had the fins and gills. He asked Joe to wait and returned with the 
club champion. "I reckon that he'll give you a better fight than I 
did," said the disappearing patron. 
Realizing that he was no match for the club kingpin and desiring 
to hang on to desperately needed money, Joe calmly extended his 
hand and introduced himself. The champ was surprised by Joe's 
name and then replied with a voice full of contempt, "You mean 
THE Arnold Denker, our current U.S. champion? Are things so bad 
in New York that you have to come out here looking for suckers?" 
And with that, the champ angrily stalked off, while Joe escaped 
with his ill-gotten gains. 
Joe was a great one for scheming to relieve people of the needful. 
One scheme involved playing a very simple endgame for quarters. 
The position consisted of three connected passed pawns for both 
sides plus the two Kings. 
White or Black to Play and Win for Quarters 
Joe worked at this position until he knew it cold. The endgame 
looks simple, but it requires perfect timing. While travelling the 
hinterland playing checkers, he would 
always 
snare a few 
chessplayers by offering draw odds. The stronger players usually

Chapter XXV

accepted this challenge, and the onlookers would back their local 
heroes with cash. For a period, the trade was very lucrative, but like 
every other dodge, it didn't last. 
Then there was the time that Joe pasted on a fake moustache, 
donned dark glasses and wandered over to the Coney Island board­
walk where chess and checker pros took on all comers for a quarter 
per go. He did okay for about three weeks, but the disguise must 
have failed him in the fourth. Three broken ribs and multiple con­
tusions were the penalty. He never saw the attackers, who were at 
least three in number and who struck him from behind as he 
entered his car. 
On another occasion, Joe strolled into Fischer's Emporium on 
42nd Street with a young lady whom he introduced as his "bride." 
Of course, she was really a he in the person of a very strong young 
player. The plan was to let "her" beat the brains out of unsuspect­
ing suckers. Unfortunately, before the team had a chance to get 
started, an acquaintance strolled in and wanted to know where the 
masquerade party was being held. 
That piece of ill luck did not, however, mark the last of the bri­
dal scheme. Joe and his "bride" decided to take their marriage of 
convenience on the road where the chances of being unmasked were 
far less. As they sped around upstate New York, they were very suc­
cessful until one evening at the Utica Chess Club. In the middle of 
an exciting game, Joe's "bride" heeded nature's call by absent­
mindedly running into the men's room. A club member called the 
police, and the "couple" left without stopping to collect their win­
nings. 
A Better World 
Joe died of cancer in 1948, just short of his 40th birthday. As I 
stood beside the coffin, flashes from his life and his stories illumi­
nated my mind. I also thought about his final years when he was no 
longer well enough to barnstorm the country. When, in fact, he sat 
garbed in a ratty overcoat in Washington Square Park, so bleak and 
leafless during the winter months, and eked out a living by hustling 
for quarters. Gone was the former self-assurance; gone also was the 
great sense of humor. From time to time, he still came up with 
grand schemes, but there was no longer energy to see them through. 
Yet give Joe Noel credit: To the last he maintained that this life 
was just a stepping stone to a better world.

Chapter XXVI 
'Ihe f>oetaster of Chess 
If, one afternoon, you were to leaf through the yellowed and crum­
bling pages of the old American Chess Bulletin, you would eventu­
ally come upon the name of Anthony Edward Santasiere. The name 
was not very prominent-at least, not at first. You would have to 
run your finger clear down the crosstable of Lake Hopatcong 1923 
to find "Santasiere" at the bottom. The young master, who was 
born in 1904, scored 2%-lOlf2, the mirror image of Frank Marshall 
and Abraham Kupchik's winning scores. Yet Tony drew with both 
Marshall and the brilliant David Janowski, who finished third. 
You might conclude that this Santasiere, whoever he was, could 
split points with grandmasters but lacked steadiness. Which was 
true enough. But for the moment, all I am telling you is that even 
though Tony and I competed against each other in the 1930s and 
1940s and often discussed chess, I knew little more about him than 
you. 
Okay, okay, I'll relent. I knew that beginning in 1927 this very 
shy person taught mathematics at the famous Angelo Patri School 
(P.S. 45) up on Fordham Road in the Bronx; that he briefly studied 
music at Julliard or, as it was known in the 1920s, the Institute of 
Musical Art; that he won his first Marshall Chess Club Championship 
in 1922 at the age of 17; that he was an extremely poor young man 
of French-Italian ancestry, the 12th of 13 children, whose education 
at City College was paid for by Alrick Man, a wealthy, elderly chess 
devotee; that Frank and Carrie Marshall, who treated Tony as a 
second son, prevailed on Man to act as he did; that Man asked in 
return only that Tony spend his summers at the former's estate. 
And that's all I knew. 
I was simply unable to breach the many barriers that Tony 
erected. 
Until, that is, I moved to Florida in 1970. I soon discovered that 
Tony, who preceded me south by five years, was a truly sensitive 
and even beautiful person. Mind you, Tony was not much to look 
at. Most people would never turn their heads when passing him on 
the street. He was short, kind of squat, dark-skinned with close-
278

Chapter XXVI

cropped, curly black hair. A wag at the Manhattan Chess Club once 
remarked that if you put a lunch pail under his arm, he could gain 
entry into any factory in the country. That was the Tony most 
people saw. The Tony I saw was-to quote Hermann Helms-"a 
teacher, chess master, artist, musician, poet, novelist, philosopher, 
chef, motorist and bridge expert." 
But I am getting ahead of my story. Before either of us retired to 
Florida, we were both ambitious young men in New York City fight­
ing for our place beneath Caissa's sun. 
The Small Ceremonies of Life 
Anyone who reads Tony's paeans to romantic gambiteering in the 
ACB-or negotiates his posturing prose in Materialism Moribund 
(1942)-and then plays over his actual games will probably con­
clude that this chess master was also a master of humbug. For Tony 
had a predominantly defensive style and rarely attacked until the 
opponent had overextended himself and was obviously without 
defensive resources. Yet Tony had the chutzpah to say that the 
Queen's Gambit stank like a dead mackerel while himself playing 
the soporific Reti Opening. He once wrote of Jose Capablanca, 
"Through him we see clearly that the anti-artist, the anti-Christ, 
ends only with ashes, dust!" But here is one of Tony's typical slog­
ging, Capablancaesque games, albeit a game in which he humbles a 
giant of chess:

There is no telling what chess peaks Tony could have scaled with 
international experience. He played abroad only once, a small 
tournament that he won in Milan, Italy, in 1953. 
In the above game, Tony played very well indeed. But it was not 
the slash and burn chess that he preached so vehemently. "Do as I 
say, not as I do" was often his motto. 
To focus Tony Santasiere in my memory's eye-to see clearly the 
man walking and talking, cooking and creating, and, as he wrote of 
a trip abroad during the 1950s, "eating spaghetti every day in my 
beloved Italy, with the wonderful wine, and loving it all"-is to 
recall that he was smitten with art and with "love." 
In fact, too smitten. Tony lived for what he termed "the Five Ps": 
painting, poetry, prose and piano playing. He painted over 400 oils 
(a few are worth collecting), penned poems by the thousands, and 
produced prose for the ACB more empurpled than a stockbroker's

Chapter XXVI 
281 
face on Black Tuesday. And in all of these pursuits-which also 
included three novels, 13 books of essays, 14 collections of short 
stories and 30 tomes of a "personal journal"-he championed what 
Henry Adams called "conservative Christian anarchy." 
Come again? 
The phrase is impossible to define except by example. For Tony, 
life was sweet agony-a boiling existential melting pot of grand 
opera, high tragedy, pulsating climacteric, aesthetic Armageddon, 
and at intervals, what he called "my Black Dog" of dark depression. 
Which is why, I believe, he admired the Spanish so intensely. 
"The Spanish genius," Tony once wrote, "is for excess. There is 
the Catholic, so truly holy and humble; there is the anarchist 
(atheist), wild and savage . . . .  As I lived among the Spanish of all 
classes, there came to me a feeling of long suffering, infinite fatigue, 
skepticism, pride-but also humility-a blending of despair and love 
and faith. The weather, too, is not kind-Castile with its 'nine 
months of winter and three of hell.' But in the South, where they 
drink sherry by the dozens of glasses, there is gaiety, even aban­
don-but always with undertones of tragedy." 
I cannot show you Tony's paintings and have little space here for 
his poetry. But his chess writing-well, he churned out thousands of 
pages in the ACB as its "games critic" from 1930 to 1963. Here is 
how he evaluated a move from a Sicilian Defense between Bobby 
Fischer and Mikhail Tal (Candidates' Tournament, 1959): "This 
'come and get me' stuff is allied to juvenile delinquency. A mature 
person, who is also a chess master, would love in a more enduring 
fashion. He would avoid the more sensuous temptations. White's 
pawn sacrifice here is unsound-true, it is a clarion call to mortal 
combat, but it's unsound." 
Or here is what Tony wrote following the move, 12. QN-Q2, in a 
Fischer-Keres Ruy Lopez from Zurich, 1959: "That these many 
moves should be the 'best,' and to be played automatically without 
question is a cause for alarm to a lover like me. What it really means 
is that a full fourth of the game is already a corpse-handled and 
fashioned by millions. How sad these fruits of the drive for material 
security! What can we do about it? It is for youth to be alive-1 
warn youth not to be dead, and memorize their elders. Youth gains 
far more with fearless life and the daring speculative challenge! "  
Note the phrases, "material security" and "fearless life." Tony in­
veighed against materialism, yet he embraced the cotton-wool secu­
rity of being a public school teacher. Possibly he did so because of 
early poverty; certainly he shied away from the artist's fearful life. 
In my view, he sought emotional refuge in the small ceremonies of

282 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
life, relishing gay dinner parties, companionable conversations and 
the intellectual respect accorded chess masters by lesser lights. As 
he wrote of an evening following a simultaneous in Pittsburgh, 
"Later, amid many refreshments, mostly liquid, I read my recently 
completed (quite remarkable) essay on 'Chess' (43 pages). It was an 
historic occasion." 
Historic? Reading a 43-page essay to a captive audience? I won­
der if Tony ever understood that he was not doing great things but 
doing little things in a great way. I hope not. 
Gambits without Attacks 
During a dispute with Tony in mid-1961, Grandmaster Larry Evans 
argued correctly, if cruelly, that Tony played gambits in the spirit 
that others played the Reti. "His games," wrote Evans in Chess Life, 
"are characterized by plodding, timidity, and opening repetition. 
He enters even the 'romantic debuts' such as the Vienna and King's 
Gambit with reams of prepared analysis, strives constantly to keep 
the draw in hand and prevent complications from getting away from 
him over-the-board. Where are the glorious games which qualify 
Santasiere as the darling spokesman of romanticism?" 
In many respects Tony's style was similar to Sammy Reshevsky's 
except that he prepared lines against prospective opponents (some­
thing that Sammy was far too lazy to do) and that he lacked 
Sammy's capacity to concoct astonishing defenses when all looked 
lost. Note the game below from the 1946 U.S. Championship in 
which Tony surprised Sammy with a King's Gambit and then in a 
better position offered him a draw when Sammy had to play 23 
moves in 2% minutes. "In my thinking at the time," wrote Tony in 
confirmation that he lacked fire in the belly, "I discounted his time 
trouble . . .  and paid him all due respect as the best Queen endgame 
player in the world . . .  .I considered a prior offer of a draw plain com­
mon sense."

well-known annotation, "with difficult play for both sides," best de­
scribes this position. 
So, was Tony a chess hypocrite-a player who talked like a tiger 
and played like a Tigran? I don't think so because he had the heart 
of a romantic, and in his manic moments, he played an astonishing 
brand of attacking chess that must have helped to sustain his amour 
propre. He won the New York State Championship four times, cap­
tured the championship of the Marshall Chess Club six times, 
defeated the likes of AI Simonson ( +3 -1) and Fred Reinfeld ( +3 -0 
=3) in match play, held down a board for the United States in the 
1945 U.S.A.-U.S.S.R. Radio Match, and competed in four U.S. 
Championships, finishing third in the 1946 fixture. In 1945, he 
played well enough in Peoria to win that year's U.S. Open. The fol­
lowing game gives us Tony as Swashbuckler:

The Blushful Hippocrene 
When Tony heard that my wife, Nina, and I had moved to Florida, 
he invited us over for one of his celebrated gourmet dinners. It was 
the first of many unforgettable get-togethers, which were usually 
shared with others among his chess friends. Aside from serving us 
marvelous food, Tony would play the piano, recite some of his re­
cent poetry and discuss his paintings which covered the walls of his 
home. Later, after the table was cleared, the skittles began and the 
chianti flowed. 
Tony was never without his chianti, which he stored in huge five­
gallon jugs beneath the grand piano. And it was under the influence 
of this Blushful Hippocrene and the fellow-feeling generated during 
numerous hospitable evenings of the early 1970s that Tony and I 
became fast friends. 
Sometimes Tony visited my place. On each occasion, he brought 
Nina a small gift accompanied by a very personal poem. After dinner 
we would adjourn to my chess study and analyze a few of the gam­
bits that he invented. Although I considered his ideas to be totally

anti-theoretical and consequently unsound, I had difficulty refuting 
them over the board. He was a virtuoso of his famous Santasiere's 
Folly, 1. N-KB3 P-Q4 2. P-QN4, and of his less famous Santasiere's 
Dally, 1. P-K4 P-K4 2. P-KB4 PxP 3. N-KB3 B-K2 4. B-K2. Indeed, 
Tony was still a virtuoso of tournament play when he first arrived in 
Florida back in the 1960s. For two or three years, he won every 
tournament that he entered. 
After Tony developed a heart problem, his doctor advised him to 
avoid tournament stress-advice that he occasionally ignored. Un­
fortunately, age and illness slowed him down considerably, and he 
was no longer the warrior of yesteryear. Now and then, however, 
Tony created the kind of attacking games that he lauded in his 
chess polemics.

Felix and Oscar 
Tony shared his lovely, white-stucco home out on South 29th Ave­
nue in Hollywood, Florida, with a young man named Hector. After 
a few visits, I realized that they were homosexuals. I was not 
shocked in spite of my complete ignorance of the subject. Spending 
time with the two men afforded me an opportunity to study how 
their homosexual relationship worked in real life; and to my great 
surprise, they had the same petty arguments, the same personality 
clashes and the same differences in taste that one finds almost 
anywhere. 
Hector, for example, played the part of Felix to Tony's Oscar. He 
was a compulsive cleaner who went absolutely wild if anything was 
out of place or if there were a few crumbs on the table. Tony was a 
total Bohemian who was bothered by nothing. When he finished 
cooking, the kitchen looked as if it had been dynamited. After din­
ner, he joined his guests, while leaving the dishes on the table for 
Hector to handle. Hector would become infuriated because he 
could not force himself to ignore the mess until the guests left. 
One day, Hector asked me to speak with Tony about his sloppy 
habits. I did so just once. It seemed to make a world of difference 
for a while, but Tony relapsed within a few months. They returned 
to complaining about each other's annoying habits. 
The bickering became so bad that Tony visited me alone and 
asked that I talk Hector into seeing his parents in Michigan for a few 
weeks. Tony said that he needed time alone to think-about Hector 
and, perhaps, about the conflict between homosexuality and his 
faith in the Jesus Christ of the Roman Catholic Church. I agreed to 
give Hector money for the vacation and not to tell him that Tony 
was reimbursing me. Sure enough, the ploy worked. But after Hec­
tor was gone only a week, Tony began to miss him and solicited my 
opinion about whether Hector would return. 
All in all, then, theirs was a relationship in which each man had 
some qualities that the other needed. When Hector returned a 
couple of weeks later, he found Tony hospitalized with another 
heart attack, which proved to be his last. Tony felt better when he 
saw Hector, but he never recovered and died on January 13, 1977. 
When a lawyer opened Tony's will, there was a beautiful poem to 
his loyal friend Hector to whom he deeded his property, including 
the house.

"Important as an Antidote" 
Make no mistake about it. Tony's was an earnest life of manifold sat­
isfactions. He participated in 34 consecutive championships of the 
Marshall Chess Club, went 37 years without missing a season in the 
Metropolitan Chess League, organized chummy little master tourn­
aments and dinner parties at his apartment and enjoyed a national 
forum in the ACB for over three decades to air his chess views and 
publish his games. What was said of Savielly Tartakower in Europe 
was also said of Tony Santasiere in New York: No tournament was 
complete without him. 
In a letter written well after Tony's death, IM Anthony Saidy 
stated, "It is true that Santasiere wrote badly, wrote poetry that 
was embarrassing, had extreme views-yet, in carving out a niche as 
our most flamboyant contemporary romantic, he was unique. He 
was important as an antidote." 
"Important as an antidote" to people who are afraid to write 
"embarrassing" poetry? "Important as an antidote" to people who 
could never conceive the thoughts in Tony's self-epitaph, "What I 
would like to have said of me ultimately is simply-'He loved all 
things beautiful; he loved the hearts of people; he loved God"'? 
Yes, that gets it just right. 
You Asked Me for a Poem 
All you ask 
is a poem, 
a dream of other worlds 
and other days, 
neither the loneliness 
of an isolated pawn 
nor the never-satiety 
of a whore, 
a light so far away, 
so beckoning gently, 
so dear and sweet and true. 
You want only 
a poem. 
All you ask 
is just a poem, 
a spirit bold and warmly soaring­
not the cancer of ennui, 
nor the fear of doubled rooks, 
nor the surfeit of mountaining dominions,

288 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
Selected Games 
nor the hunger for divorce­
but a God, 
a flashing stroke of Grace, 
a call to Duty, 
a warm embrace, 
a light reflected 
on lovely crystal, 
a haunting memorial musical­
not bliss 
but disaster surmounted Heroically­
'tis that you want and need-
a poem.

gourmet Italian dinners. And the Italian red never stopped flowing, though tee­

Chess Among the Scholarati

Chapter XXVI I 
'fhe Man of 
a Jfundred cf3ooks 
As I mentally rummage through the years and try to capture with 
memory's eye the great players of the last several decades, I find one 
characteristic common to almost all of them: a bitterness about and 
rebelliousness against the inequitable social and economic condi­
tions of the real world. Not, mind you, that they wrote revolution­
ary tracts and participated in protests. 
Far from it. Although most masters viewed chess as a game in 
which recognition came through concrete accomplishments rather 
than through accident of birth or dumb luck, they did not see chess 
as a weapon in the class war. For them, playing the royal game was 
a purely personal statement against social injustice. Indeed, most 
masters were profoundly removed from political categories of think­
ing and entertained bizarre rather than radical ideas. Alexander 
Alekhine, for example, seriously believed that chess could help heal 
the rift of the early 1930s between China and Japan; and he further 
argued that a new kind of chess, which incorporated features of 
both the Oriental and Western games, could "promote better under­
standing between the nations of the East and West." Oh my. 
The metaphors of thought generated by chess do not travel well 
intellectually. When chess masters and others employ them to ex­
plain events beyond the 64 squares, they usually land up wrenching 
reality into unrecognizable shapes. The world is not only not a chess 
board; it is infinitely more than a chess board. Just take a look at 
what Emanuel Lasker wrote during the early days of World War I .  
He makes perfect sense until he summons the truths of chess to seek 
the truth about the Great War. 
The world seems seized by insanity. The nations hate one 
another, human life is without value and all culture seems to 
have lost its price [value?). Yet one must not lose hope. From 
all this evil, good will come. We chess players know that. 
Sometimes when our position is bad we do not fear; we hope 
that the opponent will attack. In the attack the weak spots of 
295

296 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
our position will be made manifest and we shall suffer in 
proportion, but after the whirlwind of attack has passed, if we 
have only fought bravely, a new position is constructed that 
has strong powers of resistance. And so we may trust this 
terrible war may pave the way for an era of happiness. (The 
New York Evening Post) 
Good coming from evil? "Happiness" paved by the bones of a 
million rotting, staring corpses at Passchendaele? "This terrible 
war," to use Lasker's phrase, paved the way for communism and 
nazism, socialism and fascism, nihilism and, to quote the title of 
Julien Benda's book, Le Trahison des Clercs. 
That's the nonsense created when chess masters use their art to 
explain the world beyond it.'" 
Now, among masters who used chess for the apolitical purpose of 
validating themselves as human beings, there were two main 
groups-the killers and the intellectuals. For the killers, the only 
important thing was to win, and that end always justified the 
means. For the intellectuals, winning was important but so were the 
purity and beauty of their creations. 
High among the intellectuals was a short, pudgy, bespectacled 
and very private young man, who had one of the zaniest senses of 
humor-tellingly tinged with acid-that anyone could imagine. His 
name: Fred Reinfeld. His accomplishment: he sold more books 
about chess than any other author in Caissa's long history. 
I call Fred the man of a hundred books because that is about the 
number he wrote. Books mainly on chess but also 14 volumes on 
coin collecting and another five on popular science. No one will ever 
know the exact number of books that he penned, since he ghosted 
numerous works credited to others. Frank Marshall's My Fifty Years 
of Chess was written by Fred (in three weeks for .$100), and Samuel 
Reshevsky's classic work, Reshevsky on Chess, also came from this 
intellectual's typewriter. 
Already I can hear the groans. Reinfeld, an intellectual? The man 
who wrote more potboilers than the Sicilian has sacrifices? If one 
means by "intellectual" the likes of Sidney Hook and Lione1 Trilling 
or Mary McCarthy and Hannah Arendt, then Fred falls into the 
pseudo category, along with all the rest of us. If one associates the 
word with less lofty company, then he certainly was an intellectual 
who, by the way, wrote simple, flowing and occasionally elegant 
prose. His book, They Almost Made It, a volume devoted to inven­
tors who were forerunners of the giants to whom history gives 
credit, is a fine work; and his The Great Dissenters, which won the 
Thomas Alva Edison Foundation Award of 1959, is a distinguished

book. 
Chapter XXVII 
297 
Physically, Fred was not much of a looker, growing bald early in 
life. But mentally, he had it all. A man who researched and wrote as 
many as 13 books a year, Fred was a walking EGO where the 
openings were concerned and could recite entire tournament books 
from memory. I remember preparing an opening variation based on 
one of Jose Capablanca's games from San Sebastian 1911. Without 
batting an eye, Fred recited the opening moves of that game and 
announced the result. He did the same thing with the great German 
classics, which he knew by heart. Every time I tossed out lines from 
Goethe, Schiller et alia, Fred finished them effortlessly. He also 
spoke several other languages. 
The Two Mr. Reinfelds 
Conventional wisdom holds that there were two Mr. Reinfelds-an 
early Good Reinfeld who wrote works such as Colle's Chess Master­
pieces and Keres' Best Games of Chess, not to mention fine tourna­
ment books of Cambridge Springs 1904 and Warsaw 1935, or the 
lovely interpretive efforts, The Unknown Alekhine and Nimzovich 
the Hypermodern; and a later Bad Reinfeld who gave us Chess in a 
Nutshell and other acorns. 
The conventional wisdom gets it partly right. But in defense of 
the Bad Reinfeld, many of his later works for beginners, while cer­
tainly annoying to "serious" chess players, served well their targeted 
audience. His 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate and 1001 Brilliant 
Chess Sacrifices and Combinations are still two of the best books 
around for sharpening tactics. 
In Nimzovich the Hypermodern, we see Fred at his best and at 
his worst. He simultaneously provides elegantly written, profound 
insights and potted history. "Le Style est l'homme meme," he quotes 
Georges Buffon; "Some minds are stronger and apter to mark the 
differences of things, others to mark their resemblances," he quotes 
Francis Bacon from Novum Organum; and so on. Nice stuff. But in 
the same book, he writes that Frank Marshall enjoyed "an excellent 
life-time score in his games with Nimzovich" (the latter had a plus 
score); that Akiba Rubinstein "almost invariably" lost to Nimzovich 
(Rubinstein had a plus score); and that Efim Bogolyubov lacked 
"the necessary self-control" to push pawns against Nimzovich and 
his "system" (Bogo enjoyed a large plus score). 
Do not, then, read Fred's chess books for precision history. But 
he did take the time to select good games for his collections, to 
place these games and their strategical ideas in excitingly drawn 
contexts, and to produce or reproduce analysis that has worn

298 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
remarkably well. When Paul Keres wrote that his games were 
"beautifully annotated by Mr. Reinfeld," he was correct rather than 
generous to say so-just as Max Euwe was properly, not effusively 
grateful for Fred's fine translation of his From My Games, 1 920-
1 937. 
Master Behind the Author 
That Fred produced accurate and deep analysis should surprise no 
one who played him over-the-board. His chess was precise, posi­
tional and poisonous. In the 1933 New York State Championship, 
he scored 9112-1% to top a field that included the likes of Reuben 
Fine, Tony Santasiere, David Polland and yours truly. During the 
1930s he was the single American player who posted a plus score 
against Sammy Reshevsky, defeating him twice and drawing him 
thrice in five games. Fred attributed his success against Sammy to 
an easygoing, fatalistic attitude. "Unlike Fine," he wrote, "I was not 
his rival. Hence my first feeling in playing Sammy was one of relief 
rather than fear. It was no disgrace to lose to this great master-that 
could happen to anyone. I had nothing to lose; I had shed my re­
sponsibilities; I was carefree as one rarely is in tournament chess."

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
By the late 1930s, Fred had become an expert squeezer, seldom 
losing a game and seldom winning one. He scored +1 -2 =13 in the 
1940 U.S. Championship, a kind of result virtually unknown back 
then. But on days when he felt primed for a fight, he played some of 
the most exciting chess of the late 1930s and early 1940s. The 
following game from Ventnor City received a special prize as "the 
showpiece of the tournament":

An eyebrow-raiser in the style of Steinitz and Seirawan. I like the 
move not only because a Knight interposition is answered by 9 . . . .  
N-K5, but also because it proves that players of my generation did 
strange things. However, moving the King towards K4 during the 
first 10 moves is never funny when the opponent gets the last laugh.

The following year, in the preliminaries of the 1940 U.S. Cham­
pionship, the same opponents with the same colors and with the 
same result performed a remarkable encore to the current game. 
Reinfeld saved himself with another problem-like move that was 
played to the same square (KNl), though on his 39th turn rather 
than 41st. 
An Entertaining Introvert 
Getting close to Fred was far from easy. Sensitive people, who 
struggle against shyness in their youth, often become remote as 
adults. Fred was like that. But those of us who came to know him 
discovered a humorous and entertaining introvert. Like Donald 
MacMurray, whose story is related elsewhere in these pages, Fred 
had that rare facility to see humor in almost everything; and when 
he laughed, he roared so hard that you lost control with him. 
There was, however, another side. Like many chess masters, Fred 
could turn mean and biting when encountering minor-league ty­
rants who so often perpetrate injustices in our little world of chess. 
When dealing with these antagonists in person, he would cock one 
eye in apparent disbelief, toss his head from side to side and issue a 
clucking sound. This routine never failed to cut 'em down to size.

302 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
As for disputes in print, Fred could be astonishingly vitriolic and 
often, for all of his pen puissance, ineffective. I remember Fred's 
quarrel with Robert Lewis Taylor, a writer for The New Yorker who 
published a piece on the 1940 U.S. Championship. Fred described 
Taylor's style as "compounded of breathless inanities smothered in 
pixillated whimsy" and noted that The New Yorker described Tay­
lor "with unnecessarily brutal frankness" as "A Reporter at Large." 
Nasty stuff. 
On May 29, 1964, Fred Reinfeld died. He was only 54 years old, 
but during his short span on earth, he greatly enriched the world of 
chess by writing three or four great books and numerous good ones. 
As for his much-despised potboilers, he usually boiled an honest pot 
as Dorothy Sayers once said of Charles Williams, and he enlarged 
the market for serious chess literature by introducing the game to 
millions of Americans. Some of today's chess writers who attack 
Fred would be unable to earn a living had the object of their scorn 
not paved the way. 
And that, let me tell you, is a savage irony. 
*In the world of chess, Emanuel Lasker enjoys a reputation as 
one of Caissa's wise men. Albert Einstein thought highly of him as a 
mathematician, and Ernst Cassirer praised Lasker's The Compre­
hension of the Universe, an ambitiously titled work on philosophy 
that was published in 1913. Yet much of what Lasker wrote on non­
chess subjects is today badly dated. His apologias for Stalinism, 
published during the height of what historians call the Great Terror, 
and his dabbling in non-Marxist socialism suggest that he observed 
society sans voir. Here is one of his monumentally naive celebra­
tions of the German nation, which was reprinted in the British 
Chess Magazine of April 1915: 
The shrewd English merchant has grasped the meaning of pos­
sessions and their power in the world; but he has missed the 
true inwardness of things, and the rapid evolution of modem 
times has left him far behind. 
He is an egoist towards his fellow countrymen. He will not 
give the masses a share in higher things, as he wants to keep 
them under his sway as slaves. The Universities of Cambridge 
and Oxford are reserved for the sons of the rich. He views 
with suspicion our people, teeming with ideas, eager in pur­
suit of science, and ready to make any sacrifice. Who among 
us is not a philosopher? I know not a single German who 
does not carry in his bosom something of the spirit of Faust.

The morale of the Germans is not mere theory. Mother, wife, 
sweetheart, have bidden their men go forth to battle. It is the 
genius of Humanity that speaks to this nation.

Chapter XXVI I I  
Mr. cBelier;e It or J\fot 
Irving Chernev, the Robert Ripley of Chess, had a lifelong romance 
with the royal game. From the time he learned the moves from his 
father at age 12, he fell in love with chess, and it was a monogamous 
marriage. Whenever we met, out popped his pocket set (without 
which he would have felt undressed) followed by the famous 
Chernev question, "Have you seen this?" 
I will never forget how Irving's face would light up when demon­
strating positions. Searching out chess treasures and sharing the 
jewels with players who appreciated them was probably his greatest 
joy in life. When I once asked him what he would do without chess, 
his reply was instantaneous, "How does one live without fresh air?" 
At the time I was too young to appreciate the full meaning of 
Irving's rhetorical question. Years later, after getting to know him 
better, I came to understand what he meant. To support his family, 
Irving had to labor at unpleasant jobs in the paper industry-all the 
while feeling the claustrophobic frustration of a talented man who 
needs to break out. Without the pleasure and creative satisfaction 
afforded by his private little chess world of contemplation and writ­
ing, he might not have carried on. He might have lapsed into the 
awful bitterness of a failed romantic. 
Chernev the Master 
Young players are always asking me if Irving Chernev was ever a 
master. That's because Irving quit playing chess about 30 years 
before he quit writing about it. "I played in . . .  tournaments," he 
once wrote, "to see how well I would do against some of the best 
players in the country. But I wanted to enjoy chess as well as to 
play it, and competing in those tournaments was not chess to 
enjoy." 
Irving probably had in mind a number of New York state cham­
pionships and the 1942 and 1944 U.S. championships. That's right, 
he was strong enough to qualify for two national closed tourna­
ments, scoring a respectable +4 -7 =4 in the 1942 fixture. Fischer­
like or even Denker-like? Not at all. But making 40 percent in the

U.S. Championship and holding A1 Horowitz to a draw in the 
process is certainly a solid master result. Which, en passant, is ex­
actly what Irving Chernev was-a solid master. He could play sup­
ple and smooth chess even at 10 seconds, and I can still recall him 
winning some very strong rapid transit events at the Marshall Chess 
Club, including a tournament in June 1932, when he defeated the 
late, great Reuben Fine.

In the 1944 U.S. Championship for regular chess, Irving slipped 
considerably, though against George Shainswit, later a member of 
the U.S. Olympiad team, he played one of the most exciting games 
in the event.

The above game is not, as already hinted, typical of Irving's gen­
erally solid positional play. For Irving at his conservative best, the 
reader should consult his fine victory over Harry Baker in the 1942 
U.S. Championship, a game that can be found in the appendix to 
this chapter. After all, my subject here is not primarily Chernev the 
Master but Chernev the Chess Lover. 
Chernev the Chess Lover 
No one ever devoured chess lore like Irving did. "I have probably 
read more about chess and played over more games," he once plau­
sibly claimed, "than any man in history." I recall how he would 
show up at the Manhattan Chess Club with his little black note-

Chapter XXVIII 
309 
books-five of them! One for games, one for good stories, one for 
curious chess facts, one for endgame studies and one for problems. 
Moreover, he was constantly adding material to these notebooks. 
Like those actors on television with their American Express cards, 
Irving never left home without them. 
Back in 1943-heavens, a half century ago !-Reuben Fine wrote 
jocularly about how Irving "plagued and amused hundreds of 
friends" with material from his little black books. He was like the 
child in The Mikado who knew his facts and floored you with them 
flat. At the long gone Hawthorne Chess Club out in the Flatbush 
section of Brooklyn, Irving became known as "Mr. Believe It or 
Not" because of the astonishing positions and historical nuggets that 
he would toss out during his visits in the 1940s and 1950s. One of 
the club members most adept at solving Irving's positions was the 
then 13-year-old . . .  Bobby Fischer. 
While on the subject of Irving's visits to the Hawthorne club, I 
confess to having smiled ruefully while reading a particular para­
graph in the obituary for Irving in Chess Life (December 1981). In 
addition to telling us that Irving was born in January 1900, in 
Russia, and died in September 1981, in San Francisco, the author of 
the obituary notes that Jack Collins, Bobby Fischer's chess coach, 
was "another Hawthorne regular." Well, I should say so! The Haw­
thorne club was nothing more than the private home of Jack and 
his sister, Ethel. 
In my opinion Irving put his enormous chess research to good 
use. He authored nearly 20 books, many of which are still in print. 
His The Russians Play Chess (194 7) is an excellent anthology of 
Soviet masterpieces, and no one can fail to be entertained by the 
material in The Fireside Book of Chess (1949, co-authored with 
Fred Reinfeld), Practical Chess Endings (1961), Wonders and 
Curiosities of Chess (1974), and so on. I also like his first book, 
Chess Strategy and Tactics, which appeared in 1933 and was co­
authored with Reinfeld. 
Any reader wishing to anger me could do no better than to 
attack Chernev and Reinfeld's work by mumbling, "All these two 
guys do is give us the same old games and positions." Crikey! The 
games and positions seem familiar only because "these two guys" 
did the hard pioneering work of hunting and gathering the material. 
To compare Chernev and Reinfeld as writers is to do both an 
injustice. Irving wrote more carefully on average than Fred, and 
Fred wrote better on occasion than Irving. Nothing that the latter 
produced can match the former's books on Alexander Alekhine, 
Edgar Colle, Paul Keres and Siegbert Tarrasch. The net result: Most 
of Irving's books remain in print, most of Fred's are forgotten,

except for three or four works that look like staying around for 
several decades. 
All of which brings me to Chessboard Magic!, one of my favorite 
Chemev books. The subtitle, "A Collection of 160 Brilliant Chess 
Endings," describes the work perfectly; and the contents highlight 
Irving's strength as a chess author. He spent years culling publica­
tions for the 160 compositions, and he created in Chessboard 
Magic! what Grandmaster Fine called "common ground where the 
problemist and the player . . .  meet on equal terms." The positions in 
the book are seldom foreign to normal play, and when they are, the 
themes are immediately eye-catching. "How pretty! "  one wants to 
say.

Chernev the Rabbi 
How Irving became "my rabbi" is a story that is both unusual and 
universal. Every chess enthusiast plays a variation on its basic 
theme. 
Back in the early 1920s, a man named Ben Danziger rented an 
apartment in a building owned by my father. I had just learned the 
chess moves from my brother and regarded Ben as one of the great 
players of all time. He would polish me off unmercifully, usually 
while holding conversations with his wife and children. I think that 
he enjoyed my enthusiasm about coming back for more punish­
ment. 
As the months passed, Ben slowly stopped talking to his family 
during our games and began paying more attention to the board. 
When he began to lose regularly, he revealed a secret weapon, his 
nephew Irving, who arrived the following Sunday and proceeded to 
mop the floor with both of us at the same time. 
You can imagine my innocent astonishment. "How," I asked my­
self, "could anyone beat me so easily after I vanquished the Great 
Danziger?" I was completely shattered, though I did maintain 
enough presence of mind to study Irving's play carefully and to 
learn a great deal about handling openings. 
Naturally, I was interested in learning more about Irving and dis­
covered that he and his family had left Russia in 1904 to come to 
the United States. He lived in Brooklyn and would continue to do 
so until 1968, when he moved to San Francisco. On his part, Irving 
took such a deep interest in my chess progress that his Uncle Ben 
soon began calling him "my rabbi." 
One Sunday afternoon, I made my first draw with Irving. After 
that game, he told me, "I think you are now ready to join a good 
club." 
The year was 1928. The club I joined was the Manhattan. Believe 
it or not.

Chapter XXIX 
'jti Gentleman 
of the Old School" 
Edward Lasker was witty, versatile and a friend of every chess 
player. A Renaissance man, he was also "a gentleman of the old 
school"-one of the last. In two sentences, that was my friend 
Lasker. 
In worldly affairs, Edward enjoyed great success, though he was 
so modest that you would never know it. In 1911 he graduated 
cum laude from Berlin's prestigious Institute of Technology with 
degrees in both mechanical and electrical engineering. He would 
eventually become a successful inventor and back in the 1950s was 
among the first scientists to take an interest in computer chess. As a 
gamesman, he was an illustrious chess master and author, as well as 
the founder of the American Go Association. Such was his fascina­
tion with go, the Japanese equivalent of chess, he once tried to talk 
an employer into transfering him to the Land of Nippon. 
However, do not imagine that Edward was an idiot savant type 
who spent his life competing in chess and go tournaments when he 
wasn't playing bridge and backgammon. Not at all. He was well 
versed in literature and music, and his friends included such 
intellectual icons as Albert Einstein, Marcel Duchamp and Ernst 
Cassirer, not to mention the musical wizards Mischa Elman, George 
Gershwin, Sergei Prokofiev, Moritz Rosenthal, Richard Strauss and 
the like. 
Many, indeed too many, decades ago I affectionately dubbed 
Edward "the Gray Fox" because of his crafty chess play and 
patrician elegance. We first met in the early days of the Great 
Depression, and unlike most masters I knew, this man of perhaps 4 5  
years was always well-dressed, well-groomed and evidently affluent. 
His wealth, combined with that Lasker charm, wit and old­
fashioned pleasantness, made him an asset at all social gatherings.

Coming to America 
Chapter XXIX

To get a handle on Edward's life, you must first know how long ago 
he was born. In 1885-near Breslau, which was then in Germany 
and is today the city of Wroclaw in Poland. He learned chess from 
his father at age six and succumbed to its awful fascination. At age 
17, he violated his mother's orders and went to a local chess club to 
play against Harry Pillsbury in a blindfold exhibition. 
Caissa clearly got a grip on Edward that the goddess never re­
laxed. The young man eschewed medical school in Breslau for an 
engineering course in Berlin, largely because that famous city was in 
those days the chess capital of the world. The two centers of chess 
life were the Cafe Bauer and the Cafe Kaiserhof, where grandmasters 
like Richard Teichmann, Jacques Mieses and Kurt von Bardeleben 
quaffed espresso and plotted chess stratagems at all hours of the 
day. Edward loved this chess ambience. In 1909 he defeated Erich 
Cohn in a match to win the championship of Berlin and in 1913 
finished fifth at Scheveningen to gain the international master title 
of the German Chess Federation. 
In 1912, Edward's employer, the German equivalent of General 
Electric, sent him to London. There, he won the city championship, 
and as it turned out, a very important offhand game from Sir 
George Thomas, England's strongest chess player and, some say, the 
greatest badminton player ever.

Let he who is without chess sin cast a second question mark. Not 
only does Sir George permit Edward to play an immortal move, but 
our English cousin unwittingly performed a signal service to Amer­
ican chess. From strictly a chess angle, Black ought to have played

White sacrifices his Queen and mates with his King! 
The real importance of this oft-anthologized game did not be­
come apparent until two years later during the first days of World 
War I, when Edward was interned for three months in England as an 
enemy alien. He gained early release and permission to leave for the 
United States thanks to the intervention of a high British official 
who had witnessed Lasker's victory. Fortune favors the fortunate­
as someone ought to have said by now. 
And so, on October 21, 1914, Edward sailed for New York and 
arrived, presumably, near the end of the month. "For the mag­
nificent weekly rental of $2.50," he wrote in his memoirs Chess 
Secrets I Learned from the Masters, "I found a room on 59th 
Street, not far from the Manhattan Chess Club's quarters at Carnegie 
Hall. On Seventh Avenue, within a block from the club, a restaurant 
served excellent meals for 35 cents, and I found a chess pupil at the 
club who paid me ten dollars for chess lessons." 
Unfortunately, Edward could not also find a job in New York. He 
embarked on a simul tour to make money. In Chicago he met Julius 
Rosenwald, the head of Sears & Roebuck, who hired him as a safety 
engineer. He remained with the company from 1915 to 1919. 
Whereupon Edward was hired away by Ernest Gundlach, president 
of the Chicago Chess Club, bombastic piano player ("When he 
tickled the ivories, they always stayed put," Edward used to say)

Chapter XXIX 
317 
and owner of a pioneering business devoted to introducing electric 
cow-milking machines. 
"My particular job," Edward once wrote, "was to improve the 
machine wherever improvement was needed. I spent many months 
on dairy farms in Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa, which acquainted 
me intimately with American farm life. I had to get up at 4:30 every 
day, to get my experimental milking machine ready for the morning 
milking. Breakfast was served at six, and after that I had nothing to 
do until the evening milking, a maddening prospect which I grad­
ually learned to evade by helping the farmer take in the hay." 
Edward Lasker-suave and debonair man about Manhattan­
raking hay and, perhaps, adorning his mouth with a sprig of straw? 
Difficult to believe, even though he used to swear to these ad­
ventures. 
In 1921 Edward deserted moo-cows in favor of developing an 
electric breast pump to secure mother's milk for premature infants 
too weak to nurse. "I made five times as much money as earlier," 
Edward once told me, "but for the next decade or so, I had to put 
up with friends calling me a 'chest player."' 
By now, Edward was in the grip of what he labelled "the energy 
of success"-that awe-inspiring vitality which drives a man who sud­
denly realizes that contrary to all of his expectations, he is destined 
to become filthy rich. It is a wonderful, joyous energy that builds 
on itself, and Edward soon teamed up with a Dr. de Havilland, the 
father of Olivia, to procure patents for some of his discoveries. One 
of these, a liquid silver polish that required no rubbing, became an 
instant success. From 1925 to about 1950, Edward ran his own 
electro-medical manufacturing and design company, becoming the 
first man to demonstrate direct-writing electrocardiography, which 
is to say, the squiggly lines one sees on an electrocardiogram. 
Lest the reader imagine that Edward lived one of those enviable 
"charmed lives" celebrated by film biographer Michael Korda in his 
book of the same title, let me assure you that he did not. His first 
marriage to Cecile Heller in March 1920, ended tragically in 
November when she perished at the tail end of the awful influenza 
epidemic of 1919-1920. His second marriage in 1927 to Hertha 
Fuerth was childless, and the two divorced in 1937. He did not 
marry again, and although he enjoyed a long friendship with many­
time U.S. women's champion May Karff, he would eventually die 
very old and quite alone without immediate survivors. 
Lasker the Lesser 
Edward was sometimes called "Lasker the Lesser" in reference to his

318 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
chess standing vis-a-vis a famous distant relative, Emanuel Lasker. 
Yet Edward won the U.S. Open five times, and in 1923, he narrowly 
lost a match to Frank Marshall for the U.S. Championship. Although 
Edward continued his normal work routine during that match, he 
won the first two games and was clearly outplaying his famous op­
ponent when Lady Luck struck him a hard blow following the 
adjournment of game seven. Leading 3%-2%, Edward was hit by an 
attack of kidney stones and rushed unconscious to Walter Reese 
Hospital in Chicago. 
Need I say more? Anyone who has experienced the pain of 
kidney stones knows what happened next. Edward lost the adjourn­
ment and eventually the match, 8%-9%. 
In 1924 Edward played in the famous New York International, 
which was won by Emanuel Lasker ahead of Jose Capablanca, 
Alexander Alekhine, Efim Bogolyubov and several other great 
masters. Edward did well in this fast company by scoring 6%-13lf2 
to finish lOth in an 11-player field. In six games against the terrible 
trio of Lasker, Capa and Alekhine, he scored four draws and ob­
tained at least three won positions. 
Note the phrase, "three won positions," because Edward failed to 
win any of them as well as several other "won positions." Following 
the first half of the New York event, Alekhine correctly diagnosed 
Edward's biggest problem as being unable to put the finishing 
touches on tough games. Wrote Edward in his memoirs, "Alekhine 
. . .  said that I would probably make similar mistakes in the second 
half of the tournament. He argued that masters who frequently 
blundered in winning positions, very likely did not have the physi­
cal constitution needed to make a successful tournament player." 
"Successful?" That's a relative term, and most of us would con­
sider five U.S. Open titles to be plenty successful. Yet Alekhine had 
a point. Edward possessed a fine feel for the opening and early mid­
dlegame, building up strong positions and pulling off numerous ele­
gant combinations against strong grandmasters. But there was too 
often a "but" a bit later in his games.

Edward had a chance to tie for the Berlin Championship by winning 
one of those notorious "won endings."

An Embarrassment of Analysis 
On a wintry day in 1932, after I had spent most of the afternoon 
playing at the Marshall Chess Club, Edward asked me to join him 
for dinner. I accepted at once. During the Great Depression, anyone 
with a high-I.Q. stomach instantly devoured free eats; and after a 
short walk, we were seated at his favorite watering hole in the West 
Village, Lee Chumley's, just a block off Seventh Avenue at Barrow 
Street. In the words of one advertisement of the time, Chumley's 
was "Where Chessplayers Find a Friendly Club-like Atmosphere." 
Indeed, the food and the conversation were delicious, and we later 
rattled off a few skittles games. What a wonderful evening-and so 
unlike one that followed about five years later. 
It was February 1937. Nina and I had been married for all of six 
weeks, and we were living on Christopher Street in Greenwich Vil­
lage. After dinner I went out as usual to buy the next day's news­
papers and bumped into Edward on his way to Chumley's. Like any 
young married buck who had yet to be tamed, I tagged along. The

322 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
two of us, plus Hermann Helms, proceeded to spend several en­
grossing hours analyzing a variation of the Tarrasch Defense that I 
had used against Sammy Reshevsky in the 1936 U.S. Championship. 
When I next looked up, it was into the eyes of a plainclothesman 
whom my wife sent looking for me. Nina called the police when I 
failed to return by midnight, suggesting to them three places where 
I might have stopped off. What an embarrassment of analysis: I had 
overlooked the main variation! 
To my credit, I was never again so inconsiderate. As for Edward, 
he explained everything so beautifully to Nina that thereafter he 
became her favorite dinner guest. Of course, he never failed to bring 
flowers or chocolates, which endeared him even more. 
All of which explains, at least in part, how Edward came to 
spend a week with us nearly 40 years later in December 1975. He 
was in the process of celebrating his 90th birthday and visited us in 
Florida. We decided to host what turned out to be a lovely party. 
Among those who attended were Dr. Juan Gonzalez, a strong Cuban 
master who once won the U.S. Speed Championship, Florida master 
Ed Celorio and the never-to-be-forgotten Anthony Santasiere. Of 
course, we chess players soon organized a speed tournament, and as 
a concession to Edward's age, we gave him 7% minutes to our five. 
He did fine, winning a brilliant game against Dr. Gonzalez, thereby 
avenging a defeat some 28 years earlier in the 194 7 Havana 
International. 
During the party, Bobby Fischer telephoned. The story behind 
this call is related at length in Chapter X. Let's just say that Edward 
and I became involved in an effort to lure history's greatest player 
back to competition. We even helped to arrange a meeting between 
Bobby and Viktor Korchnoi. Nothing came of it. 
Said a saddened Lasker about my efforts, "No one can bring 
Bobby back. It's high time you resigned." Edward was wrong. 
Fischer-Spassky II proved that one person could bring Bobby back. 
Bobby himself. 
Chess Labor Organizer 
Edward Lasker loved chess and its masters as only a man of chess 
can. He was sympathetic to the struggles and privations of profes­
sionals, and decided to help. In 1946 Edward became a kind of 
chess labor organizer and set up what was, so far as I know, the first 
organization in this country for chess professionals, the Association 
of American Chess Masters. The aim was to safeguard the rights of 
masters and to set minimum performance fees.

Chapter XXIX 
323 
Sad to say, the organization was born at a time when many 
masters were underbidding one another in order to stay alive. Other 
players such as Reuben Fine and I were leaving the game altogether 
because it presented a financial dead end. All you needed to do was 
to observe the shocking fate of my friend, AI Horowitz, who spent 
months every year barnstorming the country and giving simuls for a 
buck a board. Edward's organization died a speedy death. 
Edward's chess play, on the other hand, remained strong well 
into the 1940s. In the 1942 Marshall Chess Club Championship, he 
played a final serious game against his old foe, Frank Marshall. This 
time around, he followed up on his accustomed opening and early 
middlegame acuity to win one of the finest and least known Amer­
ican games of the 1940s.

After moving to Florida in 1970, I saw less and less of Edward. 
On occasional visits to New York, I would run up to 5 Riverside 
Drive at 72nd Street and keep him posted on chess news about his 
many friends abroad. I still possess a critical note from him after 
one of these brief get-togethers. It reads: "You call that a visit? Next 
time you get to NY you better plan on spending some real time with 
me." It was the last note that I ever got from him. 
He died a few weeks later on March 23, 1981.

l ?J1r. J Le ms, 
fi Perfect Gentleman 
I was 15, the year was 1929, and Herbert Hoover had just moved 
into the White House-thanks in part to the popular Republican 
slogan, "Two chickens in every pot, and a car in every garage." 
America was booming. But lurking around the corner was the worst 
economic depression since Napoleonic times. If you think that in­
flation is bad, try deflation. Try functioning in an economy where 
the price of wheat dropped from six dollars a bushel in 1929 to six 
cents in 1932. 
Blissfully unaware of the blade balanced above our individual 
fates, we young innocents were playing chess in a tournament to 
determine the best high school team in New York City. It was then 
and there that I first saw a tall, pencil thin, balding gentleman with 
watery blue eyes. He wore a baggy suit and bow tie and stomped 
from table to table in old-fashioned lace-up boots collecting 
scoresheets. 
I had just laid eyes on Hermann Helms, the leading chess 
journalist in the United States. But to a young person, he looked so 
old and frail that when he leaned over my table to ask for the 
scoresheet, I feared he might topple over. 
Hermann was on the scene because it was the final round of the 
tournament, and given his interest in young players, he wanted to 
gather material for his weekly columns in the New York Times and 
Brooklyn Daily Eagle. For the latter newspaper, he wrote on chess 
from 1893 until it folded in 1955. 
Born in 1870, Hermann was by 1929 the de facto Dean of 
American Chess, though it was not until 1943 that George Sturgis, 
the first president of the U.S. Chess Federation, formally bestowed 
the title on him. The Dean is, of course, an honorary member of all 
American chess clubs, and never was an honor more richly deserved 
than in Hermann's case.

Chapter XX 
329 
"Mr. Helms," as he was respectfully and affectionately addressed 
even by friends of decades standing, was quite simply the most im­
portant journalist in American chess history. Until his retirement in 
1962 from the New York Times, he reported foreign and domestic 
chess news at this flagship newspaper for over SO years. He also 
wrote columns in the New York World for 1S years, and in the New 
York Post and New York World and Telegram for 10 years each. In 
1904, he founded the American Chess Bulletin, "a magazine de­
voted to the interests of all branches of the Royal Game, home and 
abroad," that served as this country's sole chess journal of record 
until AI Horowitz founded Chess Review in 1933. "Mr. Helms" 
published and edited the ACB until his death in 1963 at age 93. 
As an organizer, Hermann's most visible legacy remains his work 
at the great New York International of 1924, which resulted in 
Alexander Alekhine's classic book on that tournament. Those of 
you who own a copy can still read Hermann's name on the title 
page along with that of Alekhine. But Hermann took greatest pride 
in his work as the chess impresario who organized simultaneous 
exhibition tours for Alekhine, Jose Capablanca, Emanuel Lasker, 
Geza Maroczy and Frank Marshall. His was the intelligence behind 
the two most impressive simuls that I have ever witnessed, the 
exhibitions by Capablanca and Alekhine in, respectively, 1931 and 
1932 at the old Seventh Regiment Armory in New York City. Each 
of these chess supermen played 200 opponents, divided into SO 
four-man teams. And what teams they had to face! I played in the 
Alekhine exhibition (for the game, see Chapter XIV) and recall 
seeing the profiles of virtually every top young New York master 
along the line of the Great Russian's advance. 
Married on March 30, 1898, to May Whitney of the Long Island 
Whitneys, Hermann could neither support his patrician wife's accus­
tomed style nor bring himself to use her money to support his chess 
style. And so, with May encamping at the swanky Hotel Winder­
mere on Manhattan's upper West Side, the two often lived apart, 
though remaining happily married. May was a member of the 
Whitney family's celebrated Mozart Sextet and a composer of note, 
writing such standards as the "March of Freedom" and the "Yankee 
March." Hermann and May dedicated the latter piece to their only 
child, Thelma, who in her brief life positively glowed with the 
Helms ethic of service. A Red Cross nurse, she died at age 40 of a 
heart attack from overwork. I can tell you that May was heart­
broken and followed some two years later on July S, 1943. 
Master of the Attack 
In his day, Hermann played many a brilliant game. Before retiring 
from tournament competition in favor of chess journalism and

330 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
organizing, he drew or defeated such greats as Harry Pillsbury and­
repeatedly-Frank Marshall. Now, 
don't 
look 
for circumspect 
defensive maneuvers in Hermann's chess because circumspection 
was not part of his game. The courtly "Mr. Helms," like so many of 
his generation, believed in current sacrifices for future gain, the 
chessic equivalent of deferred gratification.

Both Marshall and Helms were members of the red meat school 
of chess. For the record, Hermann continued to take games off the 
maestro until as late as 1925, when he scored the full point in a 
Brooklyn vs. Marshall club match in the old Metropolitan Chess 
League.

Although born in Brooklyn, Hermann spent his early childhood 
in Hamburg, Germany, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, where a school 
mate taught him chess. At age 17, he returned to the United States 
and settled in Brooklyn. He first caught the attention of the chess 
world by playing with Harry Pillsbury, soon to become the Hero of 
Hastings, on a Brooklyn Chess Club team that captured the Metro­
politan Chess League title of 1894-95. Later, he competed in five 
cable matches against England and twice won the New York State 
Championship. Hermann's evergreen game is emblematic of his 
style:

Dutch Defense 
As White, Hermann loved to play the Vienna; and as Black in 
Queen Pawn openings, he counterattacked from move one with the 
Dutch. Three generations have known Hermann's opponent in this

transplanted Englishman, was a certified public accountant. On the

This game has been described as a "preachment on foraging," 
which means that White cut his own throat by thoughtlessly grab­

this position and that the pawn grab is not much worse than passive 
defense.

Tony Santasiere-chess master, painter and so much more-did a

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
By 1929, Hermann was more or less retired from serious chess, 
except on those rare occasions when Carrie Marshall, Frank's lady, 
browbeat him into playing for the Marshall club in key Metropolitan 
Chess League matches. Still, he never lost any of his love for the 
game and turned out religiously every Friday night for the Marshall 
speed tournaments. 
I can still picture Hermann playing in those rapids which he en­
joyed so much. He remained painfully strong even into his late 80s 
and scored many a victory over some of our best young speedsters. 
As he quietly shifted the pieces back and forth, his long bony fingers 
reminded me of a spider creeping across its web. His voice, too, was 
remarkable. It came up from the stomach with a deep, guttural tone 
that resonated across the room whenever he announced a check. 
Always a sportsman, indeed a crack cricketer in his youth, 
Hermann never played on when his position called for resignation. 
On one occasion, when a young upstart continued pushing wood in 
a hopeless position, Hermann let out the "harrumph" of a miffed 
walrus and said, "I believe that my health will hold up at least until 
the end of this game!" 
Un Parfait Gentilhomme 
In a phrase, Hermann Helms was a perfect gentleman. He may be 
the kindest and most considerate human being whom I ever met. 
He believed in and, what is infinitely more important, practiced the 
old-time virtues of hard work and honor, frugality and forth­
rightness. No man was ever more decent or had a sweeter smile. 
This pillar of the Strong Place Baptist Church in Brooklyn repre­
sented the radiant side of the Protestant spirit just as surely as L. 
Walter Stephens, the chess organizer and an ordained Presybterian 
clergyman, represented its dark side of hypocrisy and pinched 
joylessness. George Orwell ought to have been thinking about 
Hermann instead of someone else when he wrote, "The fact to 
which we have got to cling, as to a life-belt, is that it is possible to 
be a normal decent person and yet to be fully alive." 
You could literally see Hermann's image smiling up at you from 
every warm and cozy page of his American Chess Bulletin. In the 
issue of May 1912, he broached the touchy subject of freeloading by 
non-paying "subscribers." In "An Appeal, But Not a Squeal," he 
proposed "to deal good-naturedly with delinquents. Some, possibly, 
may deserve expulsion, but expelled people are very apt to nurse 
grievances, let alone grouches. Our patience is inexhaustible; still, 
we would appreciate a statement of intention on their part." 
Whereupon, after noting that subscribers were 352 years and 1 1  
months in arrears, Hermann reproduced the following paragraph

Chapter XX 
333 
written by a newspaper editor in North Dakota: 
A certain fastidious woman in this town kneads bread with 
her gloves on. That's nothing. The editor of this paper needs 
bread with his shoes on. He needs it with his shirt on. And if 
subscribers of this paper don't pony up mighty soon, he'll 
need it without a d-mn thing on-and North Dakota is no 
Garden of Eden in the winter. 
In spite of poverty, Hermann was somehow both secure and con­
tented. He loved his work because he thoroughly enjoyed every 
aspect of chess and, yes, respected its people. Unlike other players 
of his strength, he always found time to analyze with us Young 
Turks. Many was the time that we sat up past midnight solving 
minis and playing "pots." On one occasion, when I was acting as 
teller, he and a young Isaac Kashdan played Kriegspiel until 4 a.m. 
Hermann's office at 150 Nassau Street, whence emanated the 
American Chess Bulletin, was tiny and cluttered from floor to 
ceiling. With the help of Miss Catherine Sullivan, a rather ample 
motherly type who took him to task for staying out too late at 
night, he somehow produced his magazine as well as chess columns 
for several newspapers. In spite of Miss Sullivan's devoted and 
poorly paid labor as secretary-assistant for over 35 years, Hermann 
lost money on the Bulletin. Yet he carried on cheerfully even when 
conditions went from bad to worse during the 1930s. 
The sheer decency of "Mr. Helms" was probably the quality that 
most endeared him to everyone. During the worst days of the Great 
Depression, when he was surviving on soup and mush (in part be­
cause he had lost most of his teeth), he never complained and 
always managed to help out struggling players. But not, mind you, 
with handouts. He was too understanding of human nature to offer 
charity and would instead ask indigent masters to report on chess 
events that he could have easily covered himself. What's more, "Mr. 
Helms" helped out everyone equally and at great personal sacrifice. 
If he had been rich, such largesse would have been appreciated; but 
coming from someone in whose shiny old trousers you could clearly 
make out your reflection-well, such generosity gave a deeper 
meaning to the much-abused word, "compassion." 
In my mind, Hermann Helms will always be the Grand Old Man 
of American Chess. He had all the right instincts and represented all 
the right values. He never complained of his own lot, and if he left 
behind no material wealth, he bequeathed his contemporaries a 
treasury of good will and future generations-in the form of his 
American Chess Bulletin-a 60-volume legacy of classic chess 
writing and publishing that will never pall.

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
But let Hermann speak for himself. Here is a letter that he wrote 
to the mother of a small boy who needed some playmates. Note the 
lucid prose and the infinite sweetness of his old-world courtesy.

"Our youngster at his sparkling best," wrote Anthony Santasiere of this game, 
which was played a month before Helms' 75th birthday. Helms was legendary 
for maintaining his strength in lightning chess until almost the end of his very 
long life. 
James F. Smyth: The Negative Immortal 
The winner of the following game is the long-suffering loser of the 
famous Smyth-Helms brilliancy that every chess player admires at 
least once. Helms, who had a great heart, never missed a chance to 
publish Smyth's wins by way of compensation. 
Smyth must have sent the game below to Helms a week or so 
after writing this letter (dated March 17, 1926): 
When I played against Dr. Lasker at the old Cosmopolitan 
C.C. (New York City) long ago, a little incident occurred 
which might interest you. Loeb and I had a board in consulta­
tion against the Doctor and he played a Ruy Lopez. In reply 
to B-NS, we played . . .  N-QS, a move originated, I believe, by 
Bird and at that time being used a great deal by Janowski in 
Paris. Dr. Lasker smiled and said in German, 'That is after 
Janowski.' Several moves later, we played a move that was 
away off the book. When the Doctor saw it he smiled again 
very broadly and said, 'That is a long way after Janowski.' I 
intend to remind him of that incident if I am able to be at the 
Mechanics' Institute on the 22nd. If I win, I will be very 
proud to send you the score, but do not anticipate any such 
ending.

awards for his chess writing from the Chess Journalists of America, 
currently works as a Russian analyst. This book, which is about the 
many memorable chess men whom Grandmaster Denker has 
known, is a fully equal collaboration between the two authors. It is 
also one of the finest chess memoirs of its kind. 
After defecting from the Soviet Union in 1979 and arriving some 
time later in the United States, I came to know GM Denker. And I 
want to assure readers of this book that the real-life Denker is the 
same man who so lovingly records in these pages the foibles of his 
Damon Runyon-like chess friends and himself. It seems as if Arnie is 
always on the cutting edge of life, living every minute to the fullest. 
No one seems to enjoy sitting at outdoor Parisian cafes or at Lee 
Chumley's in New York more than he. No one relishes fine food, 
good drink and memorable chess conversation more than my good 
friend. His has been a charmed life, which he relates in this moving 
remembrance of people past. 
I am also a close friend of co-author Larry Parr, whose prose I 
have long admired. The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories is 
above all else a beautifully written book, which is alternately sad 
and happy, serious and witty, insightful and self-effacing. Larry can 
take credit for transforming a life well-lived into a life well-written. 
As a chess warrior, GM Denker has been called the Noblest 
Roman of Them All. When he wins, as in the following game against

The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
one of the great players of the 20th century, he looks like a con­
quering Caesar crossing the Rubicon and pursuing poor Pompey:

In the most important game of his life, played in the elegant 
Grand Colonial Ballroom of the Hotel Park Central at 7th Avenue 
and 55th Street, Arnie gives the great Grandmaster Fine a pawn in 
the opening. Back in 1944, this powerful sacrificial line was a 
novelty.

Bobby Fischer says that 9 . . . .  N-B3 ! refutes the gambit. Perhaps, 
but most players prefer to avoid it. Even in defeat White has all the 
fun. Moreover, a couple of games from the 1970s suggest that White 
keeps a strong initiative even after Fischer's suggestion. Balashov­

Thanks to this victory, Denker won the 1944 U.S. Chess Cham­
pionship and received the first brilliancy prize of $100 offered by 
Maurice Wertheim. 
There is a flip side to the chess coin of being a Noblest Roman. 
Ancient republican virtue dictates that in defeat N.R.'s must run 
themselves on swords. One is not allowed to play a peaceful draw 
and live to fight another day. Take the game below. GM Denker 
tries to drive a spike into Black (26. P-N4 ??), but his lunge is 
brought up short by a counter-spike, 26 . . . .  P-KN4! .

White impales himself rather than make a temporizing move. 
"The dashing devil-may-care attitude of youth," wrote AI Horowitz 
in 1938 about the Denker of that period, "is clearly exemplified in 
this brilliant young New Yorker. The attack is both his strength and 
his weakness . . . .  [F]requently he tries to attack where defense is nec­
essary or where the position does not warrant aggressive tactics." In

342 
The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories 
his collection of best games, If You Must Play Chess, GM Denker re­
sponded unrepentantly, "P.S. I still like to attack. If this be treason, 
make the most of it! "  
When asked to name their favorite games, 9 9  grandmasters out of 
100 select victories over famous adversaries with little regard for the 
intrinsic value of these wins. Denker is different. He loves beautiful 
games of chess like a painter loves finished pictures, and his favorite 
achievement is a game played at age 15 against an opponent who is 
to chess fame and fortune unknown. None of his other games, he 
claims, "can compare with this one for absolute purity and charm":

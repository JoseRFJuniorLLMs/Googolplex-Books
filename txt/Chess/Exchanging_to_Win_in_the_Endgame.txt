Transition into the Endgame 
The experienced chess master as 
well as the beginner will face the 
problem of the correct evaluation 
of the position before transposing 
into the ending. Which criteria 
determine whether it is worth 
going in for simplification? Which 
pieces should we retain, which 
ones should we exchange? What 
kind of pawn structure will be the 
most profitable for a particular 
type of ending? We run up against 
these complex questions 
quite 
often. 
The absence of any systematic 
investigation into this subject is 
explained by the difficulty of some 
sort of generalization. Even in 
Nimzowitsch's brilliant 'book of 
general principles', My System, 
these 
questions 
are 
practically 
untouched. 
One may propose two aspects 
of classification of the subject of 
transition from the middlegame 
into the endgame. The first one is 
based on a variety of strategic 
objectives. We note the principal 
ones: 
(I) The realization of a material 
advantage (neutralization of the 
opponent's counterplay; guidance 
of the game into well known tech­
nical positions, etc.); 
(2) The increase in significance 
of specific positional advantages 
(the presence of passed pawns; the 
emergence of an endgame with a 
strong centralized knight against 
a bad bishop, etc.); 
(3) The facilitation of defence in 
a difficult position. 
Such a classification, consistent 
with a methodological point of 
view, has been employed by other 
authors in their exposition of the 
material. 
However, in order to 
simplify the systematization of the 
material, it is also worth consider­
ing a classification based on the 
type 
of 
ending 
that 
emerges 
(pawns, rooks, etc.). 
By 'transition' we mean a forced 
elimination of the majority of the 
pieces, thereby causing a qualitative 
leap in the course of the game. Such 
an abrupt transformation is the 
very climax of the middle game and 
the evaluation of the resulting end­
ing must be carried out in depth 
and with accuracy, long before its 
emergence. The problems associ­
ated with this evaluation are highly 
complex. The fact is that the diffi­
culties of such evaluations are so 
great that intuition starts to play an 
increasing role, and then, without 
any doubt, theoretical knowledge.

The normal course of events 
should lead to a win for White, 
since he has the opportunity to 
create a passed pawn, in which 
case the game might continue in 
the following manner: 33 . . .  'i;1e6 
34 c3 'i!rd6 35 b3 'i!re6 36 h4 h5 37

plan with his next two moves.

Thus White obtains a protected

White 
is 
also 
helped by the circumstance, that 
after the exchange of the c- and e-
pawns, his king is near the black 
b-pawn and is able to capture it, 
regardless of whose move it is.

The Realization of a Material 
Advantage 
As already noted, simplification 
of the position is a very important 
method of realizing an advantage. 
Transition into the endgame with 
a material advantage is of particu­
lar significance. In many cases the 
exchange of the majority of the 
pieces leads to technically well 
investigated endings. It is advan­
tageous to simplify in positions 
where the opponent is behind in 
material, but has compensation in 
the activity of his pieces. In these 
cases a transition into the end­
game is the simplest and most 
logical way of neutralizing the op­
ponent's initiative. 
Barkovsky-Kampfkhenkel 
Carr. 1980-2 
Black 
has 
sacrificed 
the 
exchange, calculating that he can 
utilize 
the 
weakened 
white 
squares. However, by means of a

series of elegant exchanges, White 
transposes 
into

where his material advantage pre· 
vails quickly.

The comparative value of a 
material advantage will increase 
as pieces are eliminated from the 
board. The advantage of even one 
modest little pawn, often neg­
lected in the heat of the struggle, 
can he completely decisive in the 
ending. 
Alekhine 
pointed 
out 
that 
whilst the loss of a pawn in the

opening stages of the game can be 
compensated for easily by skilful 
manoeuvres on both flanks and 
by very deep strategic and combi­
national 
complications, 
in 
the 
majority of endings a material ad­
vantage (other things being equal) 
will have a decisive effect on the 
outcome of the game. 
Naturally, 
transition 
into 
a 
pawn ending will be profitable to 
the player with the extra pawn. 
Isn't a pawn an important man in 
a pawn endgame? Nevertheless, it 
does not follow that complicated 
problems do not arise in such 
transitions. Pawn endings are very 
insidious and their evaluation de­
mands deep and accurate calcula­
tions. 
Euwe--Alekhine 
Game 24, Match 1935 
Black has an extra pawn but he 
has to 'liquidate' White's initia­
tive on the kingside. Naturally, 
the World Champion resorts to a 
well-tried device-exchange of the 
opponent's active pieces.

In the last example, the player 
with the pawn majority forced a 
transition into a pawn ending 
with the purpose of realizing this 
material advantage. In practice 
we also come across positions in 
which the player with a strong 
material advantage returns the 
excess material and forces an 
exchange, then proceeds into an 
ending 
favourable 
to 
himself. 
Such a method is often encoun­
tered in the realization of the ad­
vantage of an exchange. 
Yates-Rubinstein

Black has a large material ad­
vantage. However, 
White

In the above ending we met the 
transformation of a small mater­
ial superiority (the exchange for a

8 
Transition into the Endgame 
pawn) into a decisive positional 
advantage, after transposing into 
a pawn endgame. Leading roles 
were played here by such factors 
as the positions of the kings (the 
black king was much more active 
than the white king) and the plac­
ing of the pawns (the possibility of 
making a passed a-pawn). 
Both of these factors require 
careful 
consideration 
before 
deciding to transpose into an end­
ing, and in particular a pawn end­
ing. 
Having familiarized ourselves 
with one of the technical methods 
of realizing the advantage of the 
exchange, let us turn to the ques­
tion of cases in which it is to the 
advantage of the stronger side to 
transpose from the midd\egame 
into an endgame with material 
equality. 
Bogoljubow-Rubinstein 
San Remo 1930 
White went into this position 
early with the object of forcing a 
queen exchange and to transpose 
the game into an ending.

<'i\xf4 
One may form the impression 
that the transposition into the 
endgame did not promise White 
any particular benefits. Black has 
two connected passed pawns in 
the centre, whilst White's douhled 
pawns on the h-line are clearly 
safe. However, White has accur­
ately assessed all the factors of the 
position. In the present case it 
appears that the more important 
factor is the position of the kings 
rather than the pawn structures. It 
is evident that the passed central 
pawns, supported by the knight 
and the king, could form a power­
ful mobile grouping and would be 
more than a match for the op­
ponent's rook. But the point is 
that the black king is cut off from 
his pawns, and this factor is deci­
sive. 
60 
gg4! 
The rook has occupied a fine 
position on the fourth rank. It 
hinders the advance of the pawns 
and limits the mobility of the 
knight. The move 60 . .. .;oxh3 is 
evidently not possible because of 
61 l:!.h4+.

Now, once the passed pawns 
are safely blockaded by the king, 
the rook can abandon its position 
and operate at the rear of the 
enemy. The distant manoeuvres

of the white rook are very instruc­
tive. Its object is to drive back the 
knight in such a manner as to 
make f4 available for the white 
king, after which the opponent's 
king falls into a mating net.

The outstanding Polish chess­

Akiba 
Rubinstein 
went 
down in the history of chess as a 
classical scholar of endgames. In 
this difficult ending he managed 
to win the game. The black king 
managed to capture both of the 
white pawns and yet the sep­
aration of the black pieces was 
exploited in a decisive manner.

On the basis of the above end­

that a transition into the endgame 
with rook against knight is par­
ticularly 
advantageous 
to 
the 
stronger side if he succeeds in cut­
ting off the opponent's king from 
his pieces. 
Nevertheless it is necessary to 
bear in mind in such transitions 
that a knight with a well-ad­
vanced passed pawn. or, even 
more so, with two passed pawns, 
can fight the rook successfully, 
even without the help of the king.

The game was adjourned in this 
position. After half an hour's de­
liberation the World Champion 
wrote down his sealed 
move.

Analysis of this position aroused 
great interest among chess enthu­
siasts. In similar situations, it is 
possible for the knight to fight 
against an active rook (given that 
Tal has a dangerous passed a­
pawn).

Considerable problems 
arise 
with regard to the question of 
transition into a minor piece end­
ing with 
unequal 
numbers 
of 
pawns on the two sides. A transi­
tion into the endgame with dissi­
milar minor pieces is of particular 
interest when the diferent charac­
teristics of the bishop and the 
knight are clearly illustrated. 
Transition into the Endgame 
11 
Fischer-Unzicker 
Zurich 1959 
White has an extra pawn on the 
queenside which can be set in 
motion with the help of an ice­
breaker such as the queen. More­
over, the open position of the 
black king also suggests that the 
queen could be useful to While, 
and 
yet 
the 
young American 
champion intends to exchange 
queens. 
First, he creates a passed pawn.

What influenced Fischer to go 
into 
a 
minor piece 
endgame? 
First, it is well-known 
that a 
queen and a knight often prove to 
be stronger than a queen and a 
bishop; the player with the knight 
has opportunities to create threats 
against the opponent's king. This 
ending clearly fell within that rule. 
In the second place, White has 
undoubtedly studied the specific

I 2 
Transition into the Endgame 
characteristics of the bishop and 
the knight. The long range of the 
bishop to both flanks (and pre­
cisely such a battle is in prospect) 
clearly outweighs the cunning, 
leaping knight. 
48 
\ljlf7 
49 
f4 
White now beings to play on 
both flanks. The passed c-pawn 
does not win the game alone, es­
pecially as the white king is far in 
the rear and cannot support it. It 
is necessary to form yet another 
passed pawn. The black knight is 
then literally 'torn to pieces' and 
we can begin to start speaking 
about the superiority of the more 
efficient bishop. 
49

The knight cannot be safe­

Black would not be able to hold 
the while pawns back on the 
kingside. This variation is very 
characteristic 
of 
the 
struggle 
between the bishop and a knight. 
Naturally, 
Fischer 
anticipated 
this possibility in his evaluation of 
the transition into a minor piece 
ending. His opponent's pawns, 
placed on white squares, are easy 
prey for the bishop.

Transition into the Endgame

Boleslavsky-Kotov

As a result of an effective com­
bination, White 
has gained a 
pawn. However, Black's pieces 
are well developed, and his two 
bishops, 
aiming 
at 
White's 
kingside, could become a definite 
compensation for his pawn defi­
cit. But Grandmaster Bolevslasky 
has evaluated the position accur­
ately and forces a transition into

the two pairs of doubled pawns 
clearly devalue White's material 
advantage. In this situation the 
presence 
of 
opposite 
coloured 
bishops by no means signifies a

draw. With 
the last move 
the

Having fixed his opponent's 
pawns on white squares, Boles­
lavsky thereby restrains his op­
ponent's white coloured bishop. 
An interesting endgame emerges. 
The adversaries have a similar 
pair of pieces. Is it possible to talk 
about the battle of the opposite 
coloured bishops? Or do we apply 
here an evaluation characteristic 
of a knight ending? It appears that 
it is neither this nor the other. 
This endgame comprises rather of 
two other basic elements-single 
combat of the c3 knight against 
the c6 bad bishop, and (already 
familiar to us from the previous 
example) a duel of the strong e5 
bishop against a hobbling knight 
on e8. 
These two factors (both giving 
a plus sign to White), not even 
speaking of the extra pawn, give 
him in sum a decisive advantage.

It is well known that in rook 
endgames the exploitation of a 
pawn majority is not that easy. 
Hence the significance of the re­
mark: 
'All rook endgames are 
drawn'. 
In the transition into a rook 
ending it is necessary to remember 
that the evaluation of such factors 
as the activity of the rooks, the 
possession of open lines, the op­
portunity of seizing the seventh 
rank (for White) or the second 
rank (for Black) is of decisive sig­
nificance. 
Let us examine the technical 
and elegant way Anatoly Karpov

Black resigned. 
Two rooks on the seventh rank 
possess an extremely strong de­
structive power and in a transition 
into a four-rook ending this must 
always be borne in mind. 
As already noted, a great role is 
played in the decision whether to 
transpose the game into an end­
ing, by the assessment of the ac­
tivity of such pieces as the rooks. 
In this respect, examples from the 
creative games of the great master 
of the endgame, ex-World Cham­
pion Vasily Smyslov, are most 
instructive. In his book In search 
of harmony he writes: 'Already in 
the first tournament encounters, I 
did not avoid transition into the 
ending, since this is an investment 
in the technical realization of an 
advantage. Therefore I did not

16 
Tra11sitioll i11to the E11dgame 
strain the position without neces­
sity and did not strive to effects, 
but played, as they say, "accord­
ing to the position". I play in this 
way now'. 
As an epigraph to his book 
Smyslov quotes a line from the 
remarkable 
Russian 
poet 
A. 
Maikova 'Harmony and calm, 
mysterious secrets .. .'. Develop­
ing this image, it may be said that 
Smyslov, in his creations, revealed 
important secrets of chess har­
mony in the transition from mid­
dlegame into the endgame. 
Smyslov-Konstantinopolsky 
Moscow 1939 
Already in the opening White 
has won a pawn. Moreover he has 
good prospects on the kingside. 
The majority of players would se­
lect here the move 18 it c2, in the 
hope of setting up an attack on 
the hostile king. But Smyslov, 
believes his own words: 'I never 
turn away from a transition into a 
favourable ending'.

The black king has managed to 
take 
the 
opposition 
and 
the 
passed pawn is pinned. Should 
Smyslov consider sacrificing the 
pawn? 
Certainly not. The passed pawn 
is strong not only when it irresist­
ibly breaks through into a queen; 
it is even more important due to 
its ability to tie down enemy 
forces, and thus it acts as a con­
siderable distracting factor. 
It is necessary to examine the 
transition into the ending in these 
circumstances. In the given case 
the black pieces are forced to 
watch over the white c-pawn on 
the queenside. They are being 
diverted from the opposite section 
of the front by this pawn. The ex­
World Champion 
foresaw this 
pecularity of the position. Aban­
doned to the mercy of fate, the 
black 
pawns 
on 
the 
kingside 
become a fine target for the white 
rook, and Smyslov highlights this 
with his subsequent move:

Grandmaster Irina Levitina has 
an extra pawn, but the c-pawn 
configuration is definitely not or­

endgame, one of these pawns­
the c3 pawn-could play a deci­

Transition into a technical end­

of realization of material advan­
tage in various unusual material 
relationships. 
Karpov-Polugaevsky 
Game 8, match 1974 
White has a clear material ad­
vantage-queen and two pawns 
against two rooks. However, such 
an 
unusual force 
relationship 
often 
makes 
the 
task 
of 
the 
stronger 
side 
more 
difficult. 
Hence the future World Cham­

The white bishop and the a5

the 
black knight and on the following 
move he must give it up for the 
pawn, so Black resigned. 
Belyavsky-Miles 
Salonika 1984 
White has a material advant­
age. He has two pieces for a rook; 
moreover, the passed a-pawn is 
very dangerous. But the situation 
is not as simple as it appears to be 
at first glance. The point is that 
the white knight has fallen into a 
trap at the edge of the board and 
cannot be rescued; furthermore, 
the position of the white king is 
not safe in the presence of the 
black queen on the chessboard. 
The Soviet Grandmaster makes 
the 
only 
correct 
decision-he 
forces the exchange of queens.

And 
soon 
Black 
considered 
himself to be lost, and resigned. 
In this chapter we have examined 
the outcome of positions in which 
the material balance bas already 
been disturbed and the stronger 
side tries to realize this advantage 
by means of simplification. 
Games in which material ad­
vantage is acquired as if en route 
from the middlegame into the 
endgame are of great interest. 
Combinational transitions are 
sometimes discussed, resulting in 
some 
sort 
of 
advantage 
in 
strength, 
with 
a 
simultaneous 
abrupt simplification of the posi­
tion. 
Often 
inexperienced 
players, 
having the initiative or having 
started 
an 
attack 
against 
the 
enemy king, wish, at any price, to 
crown the engagement with an 
effective 
mating finish; 
having 
overestimated their position, they 
end up being no better off than 
before. It must be remembered 
that the consequence of an attack, 
its logical conclusion, need not 
necessarily be a mating combi­
nation. A transition into an end­
game with material superiority 
can be effected, but it should also 
be effective. ln the last century 
such a pragmatic approach would 
have encountered numerous critics. 
However, our modern times have 
their own aesthetic criteria. This 
may be a good or a bad thing, but

the reality is based on the direc­
tion of contemporary chess. Fur­
thermore, technical combinations 
employed in transposing play into 
the endgame can be very elegant. 
Gheorghiu-Smyslov 
Petropolis 1973 
Black has played the Exchange 
Variation of the Ruy Lopez very 
energetically and has already 
created, in the opening stages of 
the game, serious threats against 
his opponent's king. 
The unfortunate disposition of 
the white pieces suggests the pre­
condition for a 'modest' combi­
nation, leading to Black enforcing 
a transition into the endgame, 
winning en route two pawns.

In 
combinational 
transitions 
into the endgame, precise calcula­
tions are required both for this 
highly tactical operation, as well 
as for the penetration into the 
subtleties of the ending. 
Keres-Geller 
Budapest 1952 
The game has only just emerged 
from the opening, but White, by 
means of a combinational oppor­
tunity, enforces a transition into 
the ending, gaining a pawn in the 
process.

worth paying particular attention 
to this variation as it is directly

In the given case the transition 
from a complex endgame into the 
ending with bishops of the same

colour (in the presence of a pawn 
majority) 
demands 
a 
definite 
preparation-the

An instructive decision. White 
is preparing to go into a bishop 
ending rather than a rook ending, 
bearing in mind the drawing tend­

rook!).

Current practice gives numer­
ous examples of the utilization of 
such methods as the transition 
into the endgame for the realiza­
tion of a small material advan­
tage. It is necessary to note that in 
recent years the 
technique 
of 
Transition into the Endgame 
23 
defence has become more active, 
more inventive. Fifty years ago 
even an experienced player lost 
his self-confidence on losing a 
pawn or the exchange, and the 
game went quickly downhill, it 
would seem, into an inevitable 
defeat; whereas now the defend­
ing side shows excellent fighting 
qualities and erects many ob­
stacles to his adversary's path to 
victory. 
This method-the creation of 
maximum difficulties for the op­
ponent -as observed accurately 
by 
Grandmaster 
Alexander 
Kotov, is taken from life. Perhaps 
the method consists of raising the 
maximum amount of obstacles to 
the realization of a material ad­
vantage-the basis of contempor­
ary instruction practice. It is pre­
cisely because of its application as 
a method of liquidating these ob­
stacles that transition into the 
endgame has become particularly 
topical. 
Yap-Pinter 
Szirak 1985 
White has succeeded in winning 
a pawn. However, the Hungarian

The Realization of a 
Positional Advantage 
Having 
studied 
the 
previous 
chapter it is possible to come to the 
conclusion that a material advan­
tage acquired in the opening or in 
the middlegame is most easily rea­
lized by means of a timely transi­
tion into the endgame. However, 
this principle can also be applied 
to a large extent to a positional 
advantage. This could be the pres­
ence of passed pawns, unfavour­
able placing of the opponent's 
pieces, or an irreparable defect in 
his pawn structure-all of these 
positional factors manifest them­
selves very clearly in the ending. 
This position arose after the 13th 
move in a game between the future 
World Champion Alexander Alek­
hine and Max Euwe from a tourna­
ment in London in I 922. A mistake 
in 
the 
opening by 
the 
Dutch 
Grandmaster resulted in a clear 
positional superiority for White. 
The position of the black pieces is 
passive (the bishop on g7 has a 
particularly unpromising future); 
his doubled e-pawns do not give a 
pretty effect to his position. The 
Russian player makes the most 
logical decision in the given situa­
tion: he transfers play into an end­
game, in which his opponent will be 
deprived of any counterp!ay.

Black threatens 1 9  . . . c4 to

his rooks. After White's last move 
this was not possible in view of 19

White succeeds in depriving Black 
once and for all of this possibility, 
at the same time freeing the third 
rank for rook manoeuvres.

(2) White places his king on e4 
and knight on d3, forcing Black to 
play 
'fld6 to defend the e5 
pawn; 
(3) f4! winning the e- or g-pawn 
and shortly after the game. 
After establishing these facts it 
becomes 
perfectly 
clear 
that 
White 
has 
a 
won 
endgame, 
because Black is forced to avoid 
exchanging 
rooks 
and 
cannot 
avoid the penetration of the hos­

A beautiful example of the ex­
ploitation of a positional advan­
tage in the endgame. We note, 
however, that the answer to the 
question of the strongest side was 
facilitated in this example by the 
absence of any sort of counterplay 
by the opponent. In such cases it 
is most important to form the 
correct plan for the realization of 
the advantage. Black's problem is 
considerably more complex in this 
game 
between 
Averbakh 
and 
Keres, Moscow 1950. 
There are some positional ad­
vantages on Black's side: the weak 
isolated white pawn on d4 and the 
somewhat constrained situation 
of the bishop. However, White 
retains 
some 
counter·chances, 
associated in the first place with 
operations 
against 
the 
hostile 
king. Considering all the circum­
stances, Keres decides to transfer 
play into an endgame, in spite of 
the presence of rooks, which, it 
seems, would ease White's prob­
lems, a rook and bishop being 
generally 
considered 
stronger 
than a rook and knight. This is 
shown particularly strikingly in 
open positions. For the time being 
the position is of a semi-open 
character, but if Black wishes to 
play for a win, sooner or later he 
will have to begin active opera­
tions, and then this circumstance 
will 
have 
great 
importance.

Transition into the Endgame 
29 
Black's attempt to play for a 
win was evidently related to the 
preparatory . . .  b6-b5. However, 
it is not simple to accomplish this. 
For instance, if White played 41 
<;t;>e2, then on 41 . . .  b5 he could 
follow with 42 a5!? b4 (possibly 
stronger than 42 . . . a6) 43 a6! 
with excellent counterchances, for 
example 43 . . . 
tt:Jc7 44 
ltid3 
tt:Jxa6 45 1Jic4, or 43 . . 
l!a5 44 
d5! cxd5 45 gxb4. 
And now 41 . . .  b5 is not so 
dangerous for White. Also pos­
sible is 42 \t;>f2 bxa4 43 bxa4 g a5 
44 d5! cxd5 45 g b4 with compen­
sation for the pawn in the form of 
the active placing of his pieces. 
Such devices are very character­
istic in the endgame. Harmony in 
the disposition of the pieces is 
worth more than material! 
41 
'{l;e7 
42 
g5 
White takes the opportunity to 
develop activity, 
but the 
text 
move is unsuccessful. The simple 
of 42 ;\>f2 would have been better, 
since then it is not obvious what 
Black gains by the king ma­
noeuvre started with his previous 
move. Also not clear is 42 f4 f5 
(otherwise White himself plays 
f4-f5) 43 gxf5 s xf5 44 );! e5 '(l;>f6 
45 ;\1g4 g6. It is not easy for Black 
to find a winning plan in this 
position. But after the text move 
Black acquires a great chance of 
winning, since after the forced 
exchange of rooks his king is in a 
strong position and White's pawn 
structure is weakened on both 
flanks.

A very complex game in which

In the examples we have exa­

side was largely due to the pres­
ence of a bad bishop against his 
opponent's versatile knight. We 
now consider an example in which

the positional precondition sug­

This position arose in a game 
between Smyslov and Keres in 
Moscow 1951. The disposition of

ihe black pieces is significantly 
more active, the advantage of the 
lwo bishops not playing any role 
here. Keres was not tempted by 
the mirage of an attack on the 
king and he quite rightly pro­

Thus, we have a bishop ending

And 
yet 
Black went into this position on 
the basis of an evaluation showing 
benefits to himself. What were the 
factors which convinced him of 
these benefits? In the first place, 
all 
of White's pawns 
on the 
queenside are on light-coloured 
squares, and their defence forces 
the white bishop to take up a 
passive position; in the second 
place, Black will secure the strong 
c5 square for his king. These ad­
vantages should be sufficient to 
ensure him victory. It is interest­
ing to follow how consistently the 
Estonian 
Grandmaster 
carries

Amongst the examples quoted 
above it is possible to note a cer­
tain similarity: in all cases the 
stronger side possessed a better 
pawn structure. 
This factor often plays an im­
portant role in deciding the ques­
tion of transposition into an end­
game. 
The 
point 
is that the 
presence 
of pawn 
weaknesses 
forces the opponent to deploy 
part of his forces to the defence of 
these weaknesses. In an endgame, 
where the number of pieces on the 
board have been reduced, a diver­
sion of even part of the forces to 
defensive purposes leads to a de 
facto advantage in strength, in 
spite of formal material equality, 
and the attacking pieces therefore 
possess 
great 
dynamism. 
This 
transformation of one form of an 
advantage-better 
pawn 
struc­
ture-into another one, charac­
terized by greater activity of the 
pieces, sometimes leads to an at­
tack against the enemy king, even 
with a minimum number of oper­
ational forces.

Black has a clear positional ad­
vantage: he has a belter pawn 
structure. Howeverэ it is not sim­
ple to make use of this circum­
stance in the middlegame. An ad­
vance of the pawns could lead to 
open lines in the centre and the 
position of the black king would 
become insecure. On the other 
hand, in an endgame the black 
king could come into play quickly 
and take his part in a most active

!!(aS (38) 
This is the position White had 
in mind on making his 18th move. 
White has two passed pawns and 
his pieces are sufficiently active; 
nevertheless, he cannot exploit 
these 
advantages 
immediately. 
Black only needs to bring his king 
towards the q ueenside to prevent 
further advance of the pawns. 
Then these pawns, particularly 
the c5 pawn, could change into a 
weakness; and when the oppor­
tunity arises, Black's powerful 
central 
pawn 
army 
can 
start 
advancing. White's evaluation of 
the position was correct. The 
point is that the black pieces are 
restricted by the necessity of hav­
ing to watch the white passed 
pawns and cannot display any ac­
tivity. In contrast, the white forces 
are mobilized. But as long as 
Black's pawns remain where they 
are, this advantage is not of great 
importance. White's problem is to 
disrupt the black pawns by means 
of pawn and knight manoeuvres. 
The subsequent moves of the con­
testants should now be under­
standable.

An unexpected (for the op­
ponent') transition of the game 
into an endgame is a favourite 
weapon of Anatoly Karpov. With 
its help Karpov has gained many 
fine victories. The ending of the 
game Karpov-Pomar, Nice 1974, 
is characteristic in this respect. 
White has the better position. 
He has taken more space, and 
created tangible weaknesses in his 
opponent's position, on which his 
artillery is trained. 
As 
a consequence 
of these 
pieces Black's position is ill-fated;

even the apparently 'beautiful' 
knight on g5 takes no effective 
part in the game. However, it is 
not 
obvious 
how 
to 
increase 
White's 
positional 
advantage 
straightaway. If he wished to take 
of the concentration of 
the hostile forces on the kingside

of the board, then this would

thing turned out differently. It is

From a careful analysis of this

to the conclusion that a large con­
tribution to White's victory was 
made by his active bishop (clearly 
superior 
to 
the 
opponent's 
knight), 
and 
the excellent 
operation with the rook. It is

there is an extra pair of pawns on 
the chessboard; in the second 
place it is difficult for the white

camp. 
Nevertheless, 
White's 
chances of a win are high and the

exploits 
them successfully.

It is evident that Black wished 
to be freed from the embarrassing

was worse than the ailment! Now 
a weak pawn at h6 has been 
formed in Black's camp, and the 
chances of a breakthrough by the 
white king have increased in the

It has already been noted that 
one of the most important factors 
in the appraisal of endgames is the 
position of the king. The king, an 
object of attack in the middle­
game, becomes one of the strong­
est pieces in the endgame. The 
importance of improving the posi­
tion of one's own king (striving to 
take it to the centre of the board) 
is emphasised by all experts on 
endings. A centralized king is 
equivalent in strength to a minor 
piece . 
Conversely, a passive king is 
exposed to attack in the endgame, 
and allows the opponent to win 
important tempi etc. 
In the following example it is 
precisely the positions of the kings 
which decided the outcome of the 
struggle in White's favour. 
White has some space advant­
age. However, there are no weak­
nesses in Black's position, there is

48 
Transition into the Endgame 
little material on the board, and it 
seems that the game will quickly 
end in a draw. lt is therefore inter­
esting to follow how White plays 
for a win. For a start, he offers an 
exchange of queens.

Thus White has centralized his

made any real gains as yet. It is 
quite clear that the only active 
plan of the position seems to be a 
pawn advance on the queenside.

A beautiful example of the ex­

positional factor as passed pawns 
is shown in a game between 
Gufeld-5myslov 
Riga 1975 
The situation on the board is 
very complex. Both kings are 
almost without pawn protection. 
In this residual situation from a 
sharp middlegame battle it might 
have been expected that White 
would prepare the advance f4-f5. 
However, White evaluated the 
chances of the two sides in the 
ending correctly, bearing in mind 
the weakness of Black's queenside 
pawns and the strength of his 
bishop on g2. Play continued:

The following position arose 
after White's 25th move. 
Geller-Larsen 
Monaco 1967 
It is possible to evaluate the 
position as being approximately 
equal. However, Black's pawn 
structure is more flexible, result­
ing in a potential disruptive cap­
ability by means of . . .  a5-a4 and 
. . .  f7-f5. In order to prevent the 
first of these threats, White has 
already placed 
a 
rook 
in an 
exposed position. As a result of 
the second threat, two essential 
weaknesses could be formed in 
White's 
position: 
an 
isolated 
pawn at e4 and a weak square at 
g4. As long as there are other 
pieces in the board, opposite col­
oured bishops do not by any 
means guarantee a draw. Hence 
the endgame is complicated and 
White must be very careful. 
25 
f6 
A very subtle move, indicating, 
a deep insight of the position. His 
idea will become clear in a few 
moves. Under conditions of time 
shortage, 
White's waiting and . 
answering 
moves 
only 
helped 
Black to accomplish his plans. 
26

White could have played 26 
jj_a3, with the threat 27 <l:)xf6 + .  
Black would have parried i t  with 
26 . . .  jj_f7, and after 27 <l:)xf6 + 
exf6 28 gxd6+ <;>e8 29 ,!ilxf6 
Black's chances would have been 
better, since White's pawns are 
not particularly dangerous. But if 
White continues with his waiting 
tactics, then . . .  f6-f5 may follow: 
nevertheless, with accurate play 
White's position is quite defe 
ible. White's last move allows 
Black to accomplish a series of 
exchanges, taking the game into 
profitable ending.

From the large number of ex­
amples presented, it might be pos­
sible to come to the conclusion 
that a transition into the endgame 
is bound to be associated with an 
automatic exchange of queens. 
llut then the 
obvious 
question 
arises: why do we have queen end­
ings? 
Ulf Andersson is a masterly

White's advantage in the end­

He has the better pawn structure

for the Swedish Grandmaster.

Transition into a queen endi 
can also occur by means of 
combination: 
Kir. Georgiev-Gheorghiu 
Heracles 1985 
Black could simply exchatlge /:11 
both pairs of rooks on the open c­
line. However, in addition to the 
queens that would also leave the 
knights, whose position on the

hoard makes them of unequal 
value. The black knight on the 
edge of the board does not have 
any particular prospects. At the 
same time the white knight is ac­
tively placed and it also blockades 
Black's protected passed pawn. 
Whilst this passed pawn is not 
particularly dangerous at the mo­
ment, in an endgame it can tip the 
scales. The Romanian Grandmas­
ter finds an effective solution to 
problem.

forces the game may be heading 
for a draw.

What is White's advantage in 
the resulting rook endgame? In 
the process of transition into the 
ending, 
a transformation took 
place of one form of a positional 
advantage (active disposi lion of 
pieces) into another one (better 
pawn 
structure). 
Endings 
in 
which, in addition to the king and 
pawns, there is one other piece (in 
this case a rook) need to be ex­
amined in the light of a possible 
transposition into a pawn end­
game. It is precisely the evalu­
ation of the pawn ending, after 
exchange of the last piece, which 
is the most important criterion of 
appraisal of the present endgame. 
Thus we must answer the q 
tion: 'who will benefit from a r 
exchange in the given situatio 
i.e. we should imagine the pa 
endgame. 
Evidently, 
after 
fixing 
t 
pawns on the king's flank (to d 
prive 
his 
opponent 
of 
an 
counterplay), the white king wi 
proceed to the opposite side of 
board, where Black's pawn c 
figuration is compromised. In t 
case events could develop in t 
following manner:

In this manner, we have esta 
lished that Black must avoid t 
rook exchange, though this al 
has 
unpleasant 
consequen 
namely the greater activity of t 
white rook by manoeuvring o 
the third rank, it inevitably eithe

penetrates into the black camp, or 
enforces a weakening of his pawn 
structure, after which the king ap­
pears on the scene. Such is the 
general outline of the winning 
plan, and it is not obvious how 
Black can prevent it.

the endgame, and from the games 
of famous masters we have satis­
fied ourselves, that an opportune 
transition into the endgame can 
be a dangerous weapon. 
Transition from the 
Middlegame into the Endgame 
With the Object of Defence 
We have seen that an opportune 
transition from the middlegame 
into an advantageous ending is a 
very effective method of realizing 
a material or positional advant­
age. However, we must not forget 
that simplification often helps the 
defending side, even saving him in 
a difficult position. 
In order to defend a difficult 
position successfully, it is neces­
sary first of all to recognize the 
critical moment in the game when 
one 
must abandon ambitious 
plans and go over to the defence. 
The ability to see an imminent 
threat in good time is an import­
ant characteristic of the game; it is 
often intuitive in character, but, 
on the whole, it is based on ex­
perience, an objective appraisal of 
the position and an elevated 
acuteness of thought. In practical 
play a great number of mistakes 
are made at this critical momenl 
of transition from one stage of the 
game into another. To some de­
gree it is true to say that 'inertia' 
of thought is the cause of these 
mistakes. If in the transition stage 
of the game this inertia is asso­
ciated with a change in the criteria 
required for the evaluation of the

66 
Transition into the Endgame 
position, then going over from 
attack to defence this inertia is 
mainly of a psychological charac­
ter. A highly developed 'sense of 
danger' was characteristic of the 
creative games of the famous mas­
ter of defence and counter-attack, 
World Champion Tigran Petro­
sian. As Kotov pointed out, 'it is 
not easy to develop such a sense in 
ourselves, possibly harder than 
development of other qualities, 
because in addition to a general 
understanding of chess, it also re­
quires strong willpower and self 
control'. 
There are many ways of pro­
ceeding 
in 
difficult 
positions. 
These consist of setting up the 
maximum of difficulties for the 
opponent in the accomplishment 
of his attack, preparations (some­
times highly disguised) for a coun­
ter-attack on the other side or 
centre of the board, and finally, 
simplification 
of 
the 
position 
(transition 
into 
the 
endgame, 
exchange of the opponent's active 
pieces, etc.). 
Naturally, we shall be inter­
ested in the latter, very common 
method-transition into the end­
game. 
Cebalo-Nogueiras 
Taxco 1985 
There is a tense situation at the 
edge of the chessboard. The black 
queen is under attack and an 
exchange of rooks and a pair of 
minor pieces 
is 
suggested 
by 
means of 1 6  . . .  l.ixd5 17 <E}xd5 
<E\xe5 (17 . . .  il.e6 is bad because 
of 18 'iJxb7) 18 <E}e7+ <;l;>f8 19 
<E}xc8. However, in spite of the 
simplification, there would be no 
improvement in Black's position, 
since, apart from positional fac­
tors, White's extra pawn would 
become increasingly more import­
ant. 
Such 
simplifications 
only 
help the stronger side. Neverthe­
less Black has an interesting de­
fensive resource. By means of a 
tactical device he forces a trans­
position into the endgame.

Within the last few moves there 
has been a metamorphosis on the 
chess board. The game has passed 
from a tense middlegame into a

Black 
has 
managed to activate his pieces 
and to win back the pawn. White 
was clearly not ready for such 
abrupt changes and with his last 
move he finally lost his chances of 
success. It would have been neces­

Drawn. 
It is possible 
to distinguish 
between two types of transition, 
differing in their basic character­
istics. In the first case the oppon­
ent's advantage is of a dynamic 
character and perceptible only in 
the middlegame; then, with the 
help of a transition into the end­
game, his advantage is neutra­
lized. In the other, more complex 
case, the advantage is of a stable 
character (this could be material 
advantage, for instance an extra 
pawn), but the weaker side has a 
better chance of saving the game 
in the ending. 
We take an example in which 
transition into the endgame arises 
from a completely natural desire 
of one of the players to protect his 
king from attack. 
Hecht-Larsen 
Teesside 1972 
The position arose after Black's 
32nd move. In spite of simplifica­
tions, the position is still of a 
Sicilian configuration. Black has 
repelled the opening charge of his 
adversary and intends to go into a 
counter-attack, combining operaԁ 
tions

In all the games we have ex­

stronger side in the middlegame 
was 
of a 
dynamic 
character, 
which tended to vanish to an 
extent proportional to the elim­
ination of the majority of pieces 
from the board. 
When the advantage is of a 
more stable form (an extra pawn, 
the presence of a pawn weakness 
etc.), another defensive device is 
often used-transition into an 
ending in which the character­

Nothing can now prevent Black 
from moving his king to g3 and 
his pawn to h4. If now White, 
having placed his bishop on g4, 
moves his king to the queen's 
wing, then f5 would give Black a 
passed pawn. Therefore, a draw 
was agreed. 
In general, there are many ex­
amples in 
tournament practice 
similar to the one shown above. 
An instantaneous, explosive tran­
sition into the end.game at the cost 
of a small material concession is a 
basic weapon in the technique of 
defence. 
After a transition into an end­
ing with no particular compensa­
tion for material loss, the weaker 
side often places his hopes in the 
drawing tendencies of rook end­
games. 
Kivlan-Kochiev 
Leningrad 1972 
In this position Black does not 
have any compensation for the 
missing pawn, and has practically 
no opportunity for active play in 
the middlegame; 
on the other 
hand, he may have a chance to 
save the game in a rook ending. 
Hence, he followed up with:

-;li'xe2 
Taking into consideration the 
above reasoning, it might have 
been preferable perhaps for White 
to avoid the exchange by 29 'iic3. 
He could have attacked in the 
middlegame in two sectors-on 
the kingside, weakened by the ab­
sence of the h-pawn, and on the 
pawn weakness on the queenside. 
Generally 
speaking, 
if 
the 
stronger side manages to ensure 
the safety of his king, then the 
presence of all the heavy pieces on 
the board often facilitates the 
realization of his extra pawn ad­
vantage, though naturally, when 
the struggle is still of a middle­
game character, there are difficul­
ties for both sides.

Draw. 
The following game has a very 
interesting ending. 
Ljubojevic-Marjanovic 
Yugoslavia 1978 
By the means of a theoretical 
novelty in the opening, White has 
acquired a significant advantage. 
How to defend the d5 pawn? It 
seems that Black has an insoluble 
problem, but he embarks on an 
interesting plan. He does not even 
try to protect the pawn, hoping to 
save the game in the ending.

And at this point the contest­

In the following example a 
course of action based on the fun­

principles 
of 
end­
games-centralization 
and 
co­
ordination of all the 
pieces­
enabled White to neutralize his 
opponent's material advantage. 
Nesis--Simonov 
Corr. 1973-4 
Despite being a pawn down and 
despite the precarious position of 
his king, White does not lack 
some strength. By means of the 
following move he creates the un­
pleasant threat <tc3--e4-f6 and 
practically 
forces 
the 
queen

27

Perhaps Black, with the extra

the position was more accurate.

Black is faced with some diffi­

position. 
Monin-Ermolinsky 
Leningrad 1979 
Without doubt White has the 
advantage. His heavy pieces are 
aiming at his opponent's chief 
weakness, the e6 pawn, ready for 
an opportunity to start a direct 
attack against the recklessly dar­
ing enemy monarch. White only 
needs to open the position-the 
undermining moves c4 and g4 are 
part of his plan. How is Black to 
defend himself? He evaluates the 
situation carefully-in view of the 
bad position of his king an at­
tempt at counterplay would be 
very risky; it would force him 
(initially) into a passive defence in 
the endgame.

White begins the siege immed-

For the time being White has

opponent's part to make the move 
h4, which would have benefited 
Black.

Exchanges often lead to modifi­

which it is not possible to exploit a 
material advantage. The follow­
ing game is a good illustration of 
this theme. 
Petrosian-Keres 
Zurich 1953 
White is a pawn down, but 
bishops of opposite colour by no 
means guarantee a draw as long 
as there are other pieces on the 
board. The only deficiency in 
Black's position is some back­
wardness in development. Mak­
ing 
use 
of this 
circumstance, 
Petrosian forces a transition into 
an endgame.

It is clear that after 19 . . .  'ij'xf5

The Exchange of Queens and 
Pawn Structure in the 
Endgame 
In the study of exchanges leading 
to a transition into an endgame, it 
is convenient, from the methodo­
logical aspect, to classify simple 
endings according to the nature of 
the remaining material-knights, 
pawns, etc. 
However, 
an 
exchange 
of 
queens in practice usually leads to 
various 
complex 
endings, 
and 
because of their diversity, there 
has been little study of the theory 
of such endings. 
After the elimination of the 
queens from the board the power­
ful, long-range rooks begin to 
play an important role and their 
comparative activity determines 
the evaluation of the position. 
In 
complex 
rook 
endings 
(including such material relation­
ships as two rooks against a rook 
and a minor piece or two rooks 
against a rook and two minor 
pieces, etc.) the part played by the 
rooks predetermines the identity 
of some methods of play. 
The character of the pawn 
structure is also a very important 
factor in the evaluation of the 
position, particularly the presence 
or 
the 
possibility 
of creating 
passed pawns. 
Transition into the Endgame 
83 
The following example, from 
the final game of the 49th USSR 
Championship in 1 981, illustrates 
these concepts. 
Psakhis-Romanishin 
Frunze 1981 
As a result of a subtle strategic 
struggle, 
Psakhis has won the 
exchange, but the exploitation of 
this material advantage is not sim­
ple. The presence of the two 
bishops makes Black's position 
sufficiently solid. Consequently, 
Psakhis makes use of a procedure 
already familiar to us-he returns 
the exchange, thereby acquiring 
important positional advantages. 
45

Apparently a mistake, but in 
fact this move starts an instructive 
exchange operation.

Thus,

been restored. What does White's 
advantage consist of and why did 
he strive for this position?

84 
Transition into the Endgame 
Let us compare the activity of 
the rooks. It is evident that the 
White rook has more possibilities. 
It immediately threatens 49 !il b8, 
winning a pawn. This superiority 
is of a dynamic character, though, 
and the pawn structure is a more 
important factor in the appraisal 
of this position. The two white 
pawns on the king's flank hold the 
three black pawns. At the same 
time, White has a clear advantage 
on the queen's flank (two pawns 
against one) and he can easily 
form a passed pawn. This decides 
the outcome of the game. 
48 
§J_b7

Psakhis parts with his active

Black resigned. 
Bearing in mind that exchanges 
lead to various forms of endings, 
a classification is proposed which 
is not based on formal values, but 
on the type of the actual or emerg­
ing (as a result of exchanges) 
pawn structure. 
As an example of such an ap­
proach, we shaU examine posi­
tions on the subject of 'connected 
passed pawns'. 
The formidable strength of far­
advanced 
connected 
passed 
pawns is well known, and even 
such a powerful piece as a rook 
cannot always succeed in dealing 
with them. 
A classic example of this theme 
is the final game from the match­
tournament for the title of the 
Absolute Championship of the 
USSR, 1941. 
Smyslov-Botvinnik 
USSR Ch. 1941

Both sides have advanced their 
passed pawns, but Black, at the 
cost of a rook, succeeds in dis­
rupting White's pawn duet. At the

come of the game.

dl('il\') 
White resigned. 
Endings with passed pawns can 
be divided into two categories, 
based on the dynamic character­
istics of the passed pawns-free 
and blockaded passed pawns. 
If exchanges lead to a position 
of the first type, then, in the first 
place, the consequences of simpli­
fication must be clearly evaluated, 
since as a rule, subsequent play 
will be of quite a forceful charac­
ter. 
Other problems arise when sim­
plifications lead to endings with 
blockaded passed 
pawns. 
The 
evaluation of such endgames is 
considerably more complex, since 
play is less clear or dynamic and 
here we cannot rely on bare calcu­
lations. 
Free passed pawns 
In transition into endings with 
free passed pawns, it is always 
necessary to remember that in 
such endgames the decisive criter­
ion for the evaluation of the posi­
tion is not by any means the 
material balance.

Yurgis-Botvinnik

Black is the exchange down for

the material deficiency with inter­

It is not uncommon for one

to simplify hastily, overlooking

opportunity of 
forming connected passed pawns. 
As already noted, a material ad­
vantage is not always decisive in 
endings in the presence of con­
nected passed pawns. 
Zagoryansky-8tein 
Moscow 1956 
White has a piece for two 
pawns and his wish to simplify the 
position is understandable. How­
ever, it is precisely in the endgame 
that Black has an excellent oppor­
tunity to combat White's extra 
piece-the 
formation 
of con­
nected 
passed 
pawns. 
White

A queen exchange can occur at 
a critical moment in the course of 
the game and it is not in the least 
surprising that immediately after 
the exchange a great number of 
mistakes are made, even by lead­

In the game between Zagory­
ansky and Stein we examine a 
case in which the very decision to 
transpose into an ending was a 
mistake. In the game from the 
World Championship in 1935 the 
mistake was committed immedi­
ately after the exchange of queens.

makes the advance of the pawns 
more difficult. But there are no

Gligoric-Stein 
Lvov 1962 
As a result of complications, a 
surprising situation has developed 
in this game. In the middlegame 
Black has three connected, far­
advanced passed pawns. White 
also has an opportunity of form­
ing a pair of passed pawns on the 
sixth rank (by means of cS-<:6). 
First, he forces a queen exchange.

Immediately after the exchange 
of queens, both players make a 
mistake. The reason is not only a 
sharp change in the situation, but 
also, having been under mutual 
time pressure both players were 
still playing quickly. 
Black should have started to 
move his king towards the queen­
side to stop the opponent's passed 
pawns with 42 . . .  '#;f7! As indic­
ated by the following variations, 
the h-pawn is Jess dangerous. For 
example, 43 c6 bxc6 44 bxc6 .l. b6!

After the black king's unfortu­
nate retreat, White should have 
swiftly advanced his own pawns 
instead 
of 
blockading 
the 
enemy's: 43 c6! bxc6 44 bxc6 .l. b6 
45 c7! d2 (45 . . .  .l.xf2 46 d7) 46

not be stopped. 
At this point the game was 
adjourned and Stein sealed the 
strongest and only move: 
43

Black's plans are set by these

'neither side can develop activity 
with impunity'. Black could set a

A 
characteristic 
moment: 
White avoids the rook exchange. 
The point is that in the presence 
of a passed connected pawn pair 
on both sides, the pawns which 
advance against the opposing king 
are more dangerous, since in addi­
tion to approaching the 8th rank, 
they also create threats to the 
enemy monarch. This principle is 
only valid when there are rooks 
present on both sides; the rook 
takes an active part in setting up a 
mating threat against the oppos­
ing king. On the other hand, in a 
purely minor piece ending, the 
Transition into the Endgame 
93 
king can be a strong blockading 
piece. 
The move 41 !!1, a6! was written 
down and Black resigned without 
any further play, since after 41 . . .  
a3 42 g5 a2 43 l!,a7 + <&>g8 44 h6 
the black king falls into a mating 
net. 
Stopping the advance of passed 
pawns 
How should one fight against a 
pawn chain (and against the part­
icular case of connected pawns)? 
The question was answered by 
Nimzowitsch 
clearly 
and 
as 
always, emotionally: 'The opera­
tion consists of . . .  exclusively to 
prevent the advance of the enemy 
pawns. 
In 
what 
manner 
we 
achieve 
this 
objective-with 
pawns 
or pieces, 
whether we 
blockade the hostile pawns or de­
tain 
them 
with 
long 
range 
pieces-is entirely immaterial, the 
essential thing is to prevent the 
advance of the pawns'. 
We 
should remember those 
words of the creator of the theory 
of the blockade when deciding the 
question of exchange in positions 
with connected passed pawns, and 
evaluate precisely the obstructing 
resourses available to the oppon­
ent. 
Dyin-Zhenevsky-Ragozin 
1929/30 
Black has a pair of connected 
passed pawns in the centre, but 
their advance is hindered by the 
actively positioned white queen. 
Naturally, Black tries to exchange

queens or force the hostile queen 
to withdraw and then advance his 
pawns.

A decisive mistake. After the

easily. 
Nimzowitsch 
wrote that a blockading piece is 
truly on 'holiday' if the 'journey is 
promising' and can be made on a 
'fast train'. In this case the ab­
sence of the white 
bishop 
is 
exploited successfully by his ad-
versary.

connected

of the role of such pawns is as

In this sharp position Black has

Black resigned in view of the 
unavoidable mate. 
Black's misfortune in the above 
example was due to the dynamics 
of 
the 
position 
which 
only 
emerged after the combinational 
exchanges; he was not allowed to 
advance 
his 
powerful 
pawn 
grouping in a united front. More­
over, the white pieces hindered 
the 
black 
passed 
pawns, 
not 
mechanically, but indirectly, in 
an 
effective 
manner-creating 
threats on the opposite flank and 
in the centre. 
Having examined various cases 
of exchanges in relation to the 
existing pawn structure, we turn 
our attention to typical pawn ar­
rangements 
characteristic 
for 
various 
opening 
systems. 
We 
could show numerous games in 
which exchanges 
lead to pawn 
structures and give rise to a stra­
tegic plan, in the opening stages of 
the game. 
Kotov-Giigoric 
Stockholm 1952 
The position on the board is 
typical for one of the variations 
arising out of the King's Indian 
Defence or the Benko Gambit. 
Black is a pawn down but in com­
pensation he is able to apply 
strong pressure on the a- and b­
files. In such positions it is charac­
teristic 
for 
Black 
to 
try 
to 
exchange queens (in spite of being 
a pawn down). The point is that

The reader will be convinced 
from the majority of the examples

can be two possible results of a 
struggle 
with 
two 
connected 
passed pawns: either they ad­
vance, 
sweeping 
everything 
in 
their 
path 
aside, 
or 
they 
are 
stopped by the opponent's pieces 
(by blockading, hindering, separ­
ating, etc.) and then they are anni­
hilated. In practice, the outcome 
of such 
a struggle 
is 
not 
so 
straightforward. Sometimes, as a 
consequence of an exchange or a 
more complicated forcing opera­
tion, in which the exchange is a 
component, one of the players

creates a connected passed pawn 
pair with the objective of trans-
Transition into the Endgame 
101 
forming this form of positional 
advantage into some other form.

The Exchange in the Endgame 
The theoretical study and explor­
ation of simple technical endings 
began simultaneously with the 
appearance of the first treatises 
on the principles of chess. With 
the development of chess, a much 
greater number of games reached 
an endgame. And even in times of 
passion for impressive and ro­
mantic chess, there were always 
inquisitive and persistent invest­
igators, working for months and 
sometimes for years, painstak­
ingly analysing a bishop or a 
queen ending. We have such zea­
lots in our times as well. We are 
indebted to their work for the 
appearance 
of 
an 
enormous 
number of reference and text 
books 
available 
to 
all 
chess 
lovers. Naturally, it is not pos­
sible to assert that there are abso­
lutely no unexplored areas left in 
the theory of endings. We need 
only to think of the well-known 
endgame, 
queen 
and 
pawn 
against queen, to remind our­
selves how cumbersome is the 
analysis of endings with even 
such a small number of pieces on 
the board. And rook endings? 
How much there is still to be 
investigated! 
However, if even after such 
studies of technical endgames 
there remains so much mystery 
that we regard the subject as 
'Terra 
incognita', 
how 
much 
more remains to be investigated 
in the theory of complex multi­
piece endgames. However, there 
is nothing surprising in this. The 
principles in such endgames are 
as complex as those in the mid­
dlegame. The great diversity in 
character and material relation­
ship of such endings makes their 
study 
and 
systematization 
ex­
tremely difficult. Whereas the as­
sessment of the position in a sim­
ple endgame is usually conclusive 
and verdicts of 'a win' or ' a 
draw' are claimed, the assessment 
of complex 
endings, 
even 
by 
experienced chess players is of a 
more indistinct character: 'White 
stands 
better', 
'Approximate 
equality', etc. But if the reader 
has managed to be present at the 
analysis of games by masters and 
grandmasters, he has probably 
heard such assessments as 'If the 
minor pieces are removed, it's a 
win for White' or 'Without the 
rooks Black could draw'. In this 
kind 
of 
analysis, 
experienced

chessplayers consciously or not, 
interpolate 
the 
evaluation 
of 
complex endings with the evalu­
ation of well-investigated simple 
endings. But how can one reduce 
such complex endings down to 
simple ones? How can we 're­
move' the minor pieces? And here 
the objective exchange comes to 
our aid. 
In words devoted to the prob­
lems of simplification, the im­
portant role of the exchange in 
the course of the game is often 
emphasized. The exchange is not 
only a means of solving some 
strategical or tactical problem, 
but it is also a natural evolution 
of the game, transposing play 
from 
one 
stage 
into 
another. 
There are many examples where 
the exchange is literally the very 
essence of the game. 
Podolsky-Nesis 
USSR Carr. Ch. 1977-8 
In the popular modern varia­
tion of the Sicilian Defence I e4 c5 
2 c3, White succeeded in obtain­
ing a promising position. With his 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
103 
last move 15 ɷg5 he has set up 
direct threats against his oppon­
ent's king. With the object of 
liquidating these threats Black 
embarks on a series of exchanges.

As a result of these defensive 
combinations the game has trans­
posed into a complex ending. As 
before, White retains some advan­
tage, but it is not as menacing 
now as it was in the middlegame. 
Nevertheless, very accurate play is 
required from Black to secure a 
draw.

By attacking the weak e6 pawn 
White succeeds in tying down his 
opponent's forces to a maximum. 
However, 
Black 
retains 
some 
chances of defence. 
The com­
plexity of the exchange operations 
was such that it required more 
than just an evaluation of the

104 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
emerging, superficially unattrac­
tive position. In this difficult situ­
ation simplifications were under­
taken not so much to liquidate the 
opponent's superiority, but with 
the object of its transformation. In 
such cases it is necessary not only 
to make an absolute evaluation of 
the complex ending, but also to 
make a comparative evaluation of 
the possibility of neutralizing the 
adversaries's advantage in 
the 
middlegame and the endgame.

An important and imaginative 
move. Black not only blocks the 
advance 
of 
White's 
kingside 
pawns, but also forms the import­
ant bridgehead f4 
for a rook 
exchange. The point is that the 
plan of defence is as follows: 
exchange 
one 
pair 
of 
rooks, 
transfer the bishop to d7; whilst 
the king and bishop protect the e6 
pawn, the queenside rook would 
exert pressure along the c-file, and 
the chances 
would 
be 
equal. 
Naturally, White is hindering the 
accomplishment of such a perfect 
plan.

However at this critical moment 
Black, with the help of the the­
matic exchange of one pair of 
rooks, achieves part of his stra­
tegic plan of defence and also 
carries out a tactical ruse, based 
on the fact that White cannot 
defend the g4 pawn.

The role of the exchange in the

With a 
limited amount of material, the 
elimination of even one pair of 
pieces abruptly transforms the 
situation 
on 
the 
chessboard. 
Moreover, the consequences of a 
hasty or badly planned exchange 
in the endgame cannot usually be 
corrected. 
In his last lectures Jose Raoul 
Capablanca recollected his long­
standing controversies with one 
of the strongest grandmasters of 
the 
beginning of the century. 
David Janovsky, who remarked 
that 'a well-played game must 
not reach the endgame . .  .' The 
great Cuban pointed out that this 
mistaken 
view 
not 
only 
cost 
Janovsky many lost games, but 
also-much more importantly­
many weaker chessplayers, who 
took his words as a revelation. 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
105 
In current 
chess, 
with 
the 
general evolution of chess cul­
ture, and in particular, with the 
improvement in the technique of 
defence, it is very rare for a game 
not to reach the endgame. Hence, 
Capablanca's 
sixth 
command­
ment sounds even more typical: 
'If a game is considered to be 
resolved in the endgame, think 
which are the pieces it is neces­
sary to retain and which are the 
ones for exchanging'. 
In my teaching experience I 
have found that it is not easy to 
instil 
this 
commandment 
into 
young 
and 
aggressive 
chess­
players. Therefore it is particu­
larly pleasing when one of the 
students takes this principle into 
practice. For example here is one 
of the creative games of my stu­
dent, twice youth champion of 
the USSR and European Junior 
Champion, 
Alexander 
Khalif­
man.

Black has a positional advantage 
in a complex ending, due to the 
greater activity of his pieces; his 
control of the c-file is of particular 
importance. However, the white 
cavalry safely control the import­
ant squares on the c-file and pre­
vent the penetration of the enemy 
rook into White's camp. 
The

favour 
Black and his next move leads to 
such an exchange.

A knight sacrifice with a mating

penetration of the rooks along the 
open line and seizure of the first

with an opportunity of setting up 
a unique mating net.

absolutely without any prospects. 
In such a situation the realization

In the above example Black's 
control of the open file was the 
precondition for the exchange of 
bishop for knight. The exchange 
of knights and transposition into 
a technical rook endgame was a 
more 
complex 
tactical 
man­
oeuvre. Prior to the exchange of 
knights the drastic threat of a 
mating net was also 
used 
by 
Black. In addition to a pawn cap­
ture, the absence of any counter­
play following the exchange was 
also very significant. 
In 
this chapter we examine 
positions in which one of the con­
testants has an 
opportunity of 
improving his strategic situation 
by means of an exchange. We

shall depart from clear-cut formal 
exchanges based on material, i.e. 
the result of the exchange will not 
be a 'clear' rook or bishop ending. 
We shall not so much be inter­
ested in material relationships but 
rather in the positional pre-con­
ditions for the realization (or the 
opportunity) of exchanges. More­
over, we shall not only be con­
cerned with exchanges with the 
object of exploiting some pos­
itional advantage, but also with 
exchanges undertaken with the 
object of saving a difficult pos­
ition, or at least setting up prob­
lems to the opponent in the imple­
mentation 
of 
his 
positional 
advantage.

Thus, Black did not utilize in 
this game such an important de­
fensive resource as the exchange, 
and he was unable to offer any 
resistance to his opponent. But it 
is precisely the ability to utilize 
such practical opportunities in 
difficult positions which is one of 
the most important characteristics 
of the game. 
Fischer-Petrosian 
Buenos Aires, 1971 
In diagram I 02 White's advan­
tage is evident-he has an extra 
pawn on the flank controlling the 
c5 square, Black's a6 pawn re­
quires 
constant 
protection. 
In 
such 
positions 
Fischer 
always 
plays artistically. 
22 
<tJxd7+ 
Not a bad decision! It is diffi­
cult to force himself to exchange 
such a beautiful knight for a bad 
bishop, but the American Grand­
master made his move without 
hesitation. This is a clear example 
of the theme of transformation of 
a positional advantage by means 
of an exchange. In place of the 
'beautiful' knight White receives 
an open line. This is the funda­
mental precondition of this unex­
pected 
exchange. 
Moreover, 
Black has lost any counterplay for 
which he hoped for in case of the 
inferior 22 a4 .ii.c6! with a subse­

The

vement of the American grand­
master in the match against the 
ex-world champion. 
An important positional pre­
condition 
for 
embarking 
on 
exchanges in the endgame is the 
presence of a passed pawn .. As a 
rule, with the elimination of the 
pieces from the chessboard, the 
role of the passed pawn increases, 
aggravating the opponent's need 
to block or control such a pawn 
with one of his pieces, often tak­
ing it out of play. With a mini­
mum amount of material on the 
board, the passed pawn therefore 
becomes decisive in the appraisal 
of the position. The creation of 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
Ill 
such a pawn is an important and 
sometimes 
difficult 
problem. 
Experienced players often make 
serious concessions in the middle­
game, with the object of creating 
such an 'infantryman', and then 
hope, by means of simplifications 
and exchanges, to guide the game 
into a more favourable ending. 
Furthermore, sometimes a player 
is fortunate in combining the 
pleasant with the useful-forming 
a passed pawn by an exchange (or 
creating threats, 
enforcing the 
exchange). 
Polugayevsky-Kavalek 
Lucerne 1982 
Black's position is cramped. The 
white king is very well placed in 
this unusual situation. However, 
the f5 passed pawn is safely block­
aded and cannot make any pro­
gress for the time being. Polu­
gayevsky 
tries 
to 
form 
yet 
another, more effective, passed 
pawn and he succeeds by means 
of a threat which enforces an 
exchange.

A most important positional 
precondition for undertaking ac­
tive operations is a precariously 
situated opponent's king. Natur­
ally, this factor is very important 
in the middlegame, where an at­
tack on the king is one of the 
natural 
and effective ways 
of 
achieving victory. In the endgame 
this method of evaluating the 
position is just as valid, despite 
the sharp reduction of the number 
of pieces. In the final stages of the 
gameƻ an uneasy or precarious 
situation of the adversary's king 
can be an important positional 
pre-requisite for embarking on 
exchange operations. 
Ambroz-Honfi 
Trnava 1982 
In spite of the limited material, 
White's 
position 
is 
preferable 
because of the possibility of an 
attack against the king. White's 
immediate 
problem 
is 
tile 
exchange of the chief defender of 
black's fortress-the f6 knight, 
and thereby opening the f-file for 
an attacking operation.

In the above example a prof­

and a simultaneous attack against 
the king and the weak pawns on 
the queenside, thereby restricting 
the mobility of the black pieces. 
The question arises, could Black 
himself, in this difficult defensive 
position have made use of such a 
defensive 
resource 
as 
the 
exchange? 
Let us return to the position

In the study of the problems of 
the positional preconditions for 
exchange in complex endgames, it 
is difficult to single out any spe­
cific individual factor. Often such 
preconditions are entangled with 
each other and it is necessary to 
examine them as a whole. In the 
example from the game between 
Ambroz 
and 
Honfi, 
White 
exploited 
both 
the 
precarious 
placing of the opponent's king 
and the presence of pawn weak­
nesses. The exchange also plays 
an important role in positions 
where the insecure position of the 
king is combined with the pres­
ence of passed pawns. 
Andrianov-Efimov 
USSR 1982 
There is a tense endgame on the 
board. White has a strong passed 
pawn in the centre, but Black has 
two passed pawns on the queen­
side and a material advantage. 
And yet the decisive factor in 
evaluating of the position is the 
precarious situation of the black 
king. However, it is only with the 
help of an exchange that this cir­
cumstance can be emphasized and 
exploited. In order to eliminate 
the Black king's defences, White

embarks on a plan associated with 
the exchange of light-coloured 
bishops.

However, not infrequently, there 
are cases where the opponent has 
a trump card of his own which 
enables him to equalize or to par­

such 
situations 
a 
purposeful 
exchange can be carried out in 
order to suppress the opponent's 
counterplay.

plusses on Black's side should not 
be underestimated. He also has a 
passed d-pawn, a well placed 
bishop, and the position of the 
white king is not absolutely safe. 
It is this last circumstance which 
suggests to White the idea of 
exchanging one pair of rooks. The 
classicar postulate-exchange the 
rival's active pieces without 'spill­

We may find examples in the 
games of good chess players, even 
masters, of exchanges made in 
error (or omitting the exchange in 
error) resulting in the loss of half 
a point. 
The reason for such mistakes is 
the difficulty of evaluation and 
calculation in a complex ending. 
The prevalence of these mistakes 
and careless slips is a negative but 
highly objective proof of the im­
portance of the subject under ex­
amination.

Clearly 
White 
wishes 
to 
exchange from the open c-file, 
where it could be pinned. And yet 
the move, deriving from both of 
these two considerations, was un­
satisfactory: 23 e4! was necessary, 
blocking Black's e5 pawn and 
denying activity to his dark col­
oured bishop. Analysis of the 
position shows that after 23 e4 
Black would not have succeeded 
in exploiting the precarious posi­
tion of the knight on the c-file.

In the presence of important 
positional 
pre-conditions, 
not 
only the exchange but also the 
threat of an exchange can be de­
cisive. 'The threat is stronger than 
its execution'-this classicial aph­
orism is very appropriate in chess 
circles. 
Often it is not possible to cate­
gorize events on the chessboard. 
One of the protagonists dictates 
his will during a struggle, utiliz­
ing, though not always realizing, a 
series of strong threats. The ar­
senal of such threats is very wide 
in chess: sacrifice of bishop on h7 
or the formation of an isolated 
pawn in the rivars camp, penetra­
tion of the seventh rank with the 
rooks, or the prevention of coun­
terplay. In the endgame in par­
ticular, the threat of transposing 
into a technically won ending by 
means of an exchange is often 
effective. 
In avoiding such an 
exchange the opponent is forced 
to go into still greater material 
and 
positional 
concessions. 
Naturally no skilled chessplayer 
allows an exchange leading to 
catastrophe. Hence, sometimes a 
move made during the course of 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
121 
the game seems incomprehensible 
to inexperienced players. Why did 
the master avoid the exchange, 
though this is clearly bad? Natur­
ally, the experienced player knows 
that this is 'bad', but he does not 
wish to go down submissively in a 
hopeless, well-known ending. 
Hebert-Portisch 
Rio de Janiero 1979 
The bishop in this position is 
clearly stronger than the knight. It 
discharges 
X-rays through 
the 
weak e4 pawn on to the white 
king. These positional pre-con­
ditions suggest the subsequent 
move.

and White resigned. 
Studying the problem of pos­
itional 
pre-conditions 
for 
the 
exchange in an ending, we cannot 
leave out a discussion of the no­
torious question: 'which piece is 
the stronger, the bishop or the 
knight?' 
Except for personal taste, in 
evaluating the 
strength of the 
minor pieces it is necessary to 
study the specific peculiarities of 
the position objectively. Begin­
ners of chess are accustomed to 
compare 
the 
strength 
of the 
pieces with pawns. On this par­
ticular scale the strength of the 
bishop or knight is approxim­
ately 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
three 
pawns. This is an absolute and 
invariable 
calculation 
of 
the 
strength 
of the 
minor 
pieces. 
However, in addition to these ab­
solute constants, there is also the 
relative strength of every piece, 
which is much more important, 
and which is dependent on a 
whole series of factors. First and 
foremost one should consider the 
'impact' of the 
piece (i.e. the 
number of squares it controls), its 
safety (the independence of the 
square 
it 
occupies), 
activity 
(proximity to the main struggle), 
mobility (i.e. agility of the piece, 
ability to quickly transfer from 
one part of the board to another), 
and 
finally, 
coordination with 
other pieces. In the expressive 
terms of the well-known Len­
ingrad 
master and theoretician 
Lisitsin, these five factors give a 
·correction coefficient' to the ab­
solute strength of the pieces. It is 
understood that the strength of a 
minor figure changes in accord­
ance with the character of the 
position. Nevertheless it is pos­
sible to indicate some general 
principles. In open positions the 
bishop placed on diagonals free 
of pawns is generally stronger 
than the knight. It is particularly 
superior to the knight when there 
are passed pawns present, since 
the bishop can support the ad­
vance of his pawns from afar, 
and at the same time control the 
situation 
on 
the 
other 
flank. 
Again in a battle with enemy 
pawns, the bishop is more fre­
quently stronger than the knight. 
The superiority of the knight 
over the bishop is apparent in 
closed positions, in which free­
dom of movement of the bishop 
is 
limited 
by 
pawn 
chains. 
Although the knight is not so effi­
cient, it can block the opponent's 
passed pawns beautifully. More­
over it cooperates very well with 
the queen and sometimes together 
with the rook it can set up mating 
threats for the enemy king. 
These general considerations of 
the relative strength of knight and 
bishop are useful to us in the 
section dealing with the transition 
from a complex ending into a 
technical 
endgame 
of 
'knight 
against bishop'. However, in a 
study of the positional pre-con­
ditions, 
the 
exchange 
of 
the 
knight for the bishop must always 
be taken into consideration.

Svenningsson--Maeder 
lOth Corr. World Ch. 
We have a complex King's 
Indian endgame on the board. Let 
us compare the relative strengths 
of the minor pieces. Comparing 
the same pieces, the strength of 
the 
knights 
is 
approximately 
equal. At first glance the li!ack 
knight is placed somewhat more 
actively, but the white kight fulfils 
extremely important functions; it 
protects the a2 and d5 pawns and 
controls 
the weak e4 square. 
Moreover it has good prospects in 
conjunction with the threat 23 
.£) b5 (22 .
.
.
 a6 is bad since 23 a3 
and the black knight is lost). A 
comparison 
of 
the 
relative 
strengths of the bishops is clearly 
in Black's favour, since the white 
bishop, constrained by its own 
pawn at f4 and by the hostile 
pawn c5, only fulfils defensive 
functions. Thus in every indi­
vidual comparison of strength we 
find a small plus on Black's side. 
But chess is not about such ele­
mentary 
arithmetic, 
and 
two 
small pluses do not always give a 
big one. The presence of four 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
123 
minor pieces on the board gives 
White the opportunity of holding 
on to equality. In order to high­
light 
White's 
disadvantages, 
Black only needs to set his bishop 
against his adversaries' knight. 
This consideration suggested the 
far from obvious decision of the 
German student. The exchange of 
the formidable black bishop is 
fully justified in this case.

Transition From a Complex to 
a Simple Endgame With 
Material Equality 
Having 
familiarized 
ourselves 
with the basic positional pre-con­
ditions for exchanges into com­
plex endings, we move to the 
question of transition from a 
complex 
multi-piece 
endgame 
into a simple, technical one. 
But before going into the ex­
amination of such examples, clas­
sified by the 
resulting ending 
(rook, bishop, etc.), it is necessary 
to note that such a transition is 
not easy to accomplish by a series 
of simple exchanges. In a game 
between 
highly 
skilled 
chess 
players, such simplifications are 
usually accomplished by a com­
bination of general strategic plan­
ning 
and 
preliminary 
careful 
preparations. 
Complex 
trans· 
itions must be examined objec­
tively, in the light of all the rele­
vant factors of the situation, and 
sometimes taking into account 
circumstances outside the boun­
daries of the chessboard. The hid­
den psychological make-up of the 
protagonists, personal styles, the 
amount of time remaining on the 
clocks, the stage of the tourna­
ment and a whole host of other 
factors have a bearing on the cho­
sen 
continuation, 
leading 
to 
changes in the course of the game. 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
125 
We begin with a complex and 
dramatic struggle. 
Tukmakov-Kovacevic 
Hastings 1982-3 
This multi-piece position could 
be classified as an endgame based 
on the one criterion-the absence 
of queens. Black's position is not 
easy. 
His 
opponent 
has 
two 
strong bishops and considerable 
pressure on the queenside. How­
ever, subsequent events develop 
with cinematographic speed. 
18 
h61 
With this modest move Black 
enforces simplification, 
but in 
point of fact, play is transposed

I t  is interesting and instructive 
to note how each exchange led to 
an improvement in the position 
of the black pieces and to their 
increased activity. 
In endings with an open centre 
the bishop is, as a rule, stronger 
than a knight. The advantage of 
two bishops against two knights 
is particularly notable. In prac­
tice we do not meet with such a 
material relationship very often. 
The presence of two pieces some­
times levels out this superiority. 
If we also have queens on the 
board, then the strategic pattern 
of the contest is reminiscent of 
the middlegame, and the main 
factor in evaluating the position 
is the safety of the kings. In com­
plex rook endings, particularly 
with four rooks, often the deci­
sive criteria of evaluation is the 
activity of these powerful long­
range pieces. The question of the 
realization of the advantage of 
the two bishops over two knights 
recedes in to a second plan.

In our view the above ending

complex multi-piece 
which the exchange of one

a transition into

rook endgame. Thus White rea­
lized an apparently insignificant 
positional advantage. 
In the last two examples we met 
with complex multi-piece end­
games, in which exchanges led to 
an eventual transition into rook 
endings. We should point out that 
in spite of the existence of numer­
ous reference and handbooks on 
the theory of rook endgames, 
there is such a wide variety and 
high degree of technical com­
plexity associated with these end­
ings that they are very difficult to 
manage in practical play. There is 
a very wide range of various tech­
nical resources in rook endings 
and the ability to utilize these 
resources has always been the 
hallmark of the highest class of 
professional chessplayers. Capa­
blanca and Rubinstein, for in­
stance, were the classical great 
past masters of the rook endgame. 
Statistics of numerous competi­
tions show that approximately 
half of all endgames finish in rook 
endings. Their study is therefore 
of great 
practical 
importance. 
However, we do not propose to 
enter into an investigation of such 
endings. Our aim is to teach the 
reader to guide complex multi­
piece endings into a profitable 
rook ending, for instance, a rook 
ending with an advantage which 
can be exploited in further play, 
or in the case of defending in a 
difficult situation, to guide play 
into a position with specific draw­
ing tendencies. We have already 
emphasized the radical changes 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
129 
which take place when transpos­
ing play from one stage of the 
game into another, illustrated in 
examples of transitions from mid­
dlegamc into the endgame. We 
shall now be interested in techni­
cal exchanges resulting in transi­
tions into pure rook endgames, 
i.e. we introduce a formalization 
of such examples based on the 
material remaining on the chess­
board. 
Karpov-Hort

tion. 
By 
means 
of carefully 
planned exchanges, White trans­
poses a multi-piece endgame into 
a won rook endgame. 
Levitina-Melashvili

Two bishops and the weakness 
of the black e4 pawn define the 
world title candidate's advantage. 
We follow the realization of this

After this move play is forced 
and 
literally with almost every 
move a pair of pieces is eliminated 
from the board, and subsequently 
a new situation arises, in accord­
ance with White's calculations. 
All of this was evaluated by White 
to the end. The brilliant combina­

tactical calculations of Irina Levi­

chess masters.

Black has acquired a clear posi­

have sufficient protection from 
the bishops and White's position 
appears to be solid. In order to 
win, Black needs an accurate plan 
to strengthen the position of his 
pieces. First of all it is necessary to 
activate his dark-squared bishop 
and to centralize his king. Then, 
by exchanging bishops, the game 
will transpose into a four-rook 
endgame in which it should be 
possible to attack White's pawn

that

:l!xaS? 
The American player commits 
a mistake, having evaluated the 
arising 
minor-piece 
endgame 
incorrectly. He should have tried 
to force Black to exchange on a2; 
whilst an exchange of his b-pawn 
for Black's a-pawn would have 
enabled White to place his rook 
on the seventh rank. White's 
chances would have been no 
worse. 
35 
bxaS 
What was White's mistake? He 
gave his opponent an opportunity 
to fonn a passed pawn, even 
though this is a doubled pawn. In 
conjunction with the possibility of 
creating a passed pawn on the 
kingside this gives Black signific­
ant 
chances 
of success. 
The 
bishop in this type of position 
(with a passed pawn on either 
flank) is superior to the knight. 
The Hungarian grandmaster does 
not miss his chances in the subse­
quent struggle.

And after overcoming some

Adorjan

The above example demon­
strates once more how carefully 
we should approach the problem 
of exchanging from one type of 
endgame (in the given case of a 
rook 
and 
minor 
piece) 
into 
another (minor piece). As a rule a 
mistake here cannot be corrected.

Aseev-M. Gurevich 
USSR 1983 
The position appears to be in 
White's favour. He has a spatial 
advantage and the two bishops. 
Nevertheless there are no weak­
nesses in Black's position and his 
pieces are placed harmoniously. A 
mistake made by a very exper­
ienced and strong master is there· 
fore more instructive. 
22 
'i!i'bS? 
Why? In the resulting minor­
piece ending Black will have a 
hard and hopeless defence. In 
contrast, after a reorganization of 
his pieces by a plan line . . .  aS . . .  
b6 . . . 'i!i'd8, with an eventual 
transfer of the knight to c5 would 
have given Black a 'playable' 
position. Is it possible that there is 
a psychological explanation to 22 
'i!i'b5? 
But 
it 
could 
be 
simpler-the player did not wish 
to enter into a complex struggle 
and preferred the way of simplifi­
cation. Who knows?

As a rule, in the presence of 
passed pawns on both sides, the 
bishop is stronger than the knight. 
However, the participation of the 
rooks in the struggle give White 
some counter chances, hence 
Black transposes play into a prof­

c4-d3-e2, after which ll.el fol­
lows, forcing the exchange and 
transposing into a won pawn end­
game. This is why spectators did 
not see any further play in this 
game. 
In the above examples, showing 
successful or mistaken transitions 
into multi-piece endings, we have 
been 
dealing 
with 
endgames 
involving bishop against knight, 
i.e. technical endings of the strug­
gle 
between 
different 
minor 
pieces. In these games the contest­
ants were obliged to evaluate not 
only the nominal face value of the 
minor pieces, but also their 'mar­
ket value' (using Botvinnik's ap­
propriate expression). It is not 
simple to determine these 'market 
values'; this problem requires a 
deep insight into the secrets of the 
position. 
The value of the same pieces is 
by no means identical. In many 
cases it depends on the pawn 
structure (particularly in knight 
endings), 
coordination 
of 
the 
minor pieces with the king and a 
whole series of other factors. 
In the following diagram a 
young Soviet player utilizes the 
more active disposition of his 
pieces admirably, preventing any 
counterplay for his opponent and 
forcing him to transpose the game 
into an inferior ending. Black's 
play in the concluding stages is 
most convincing. 
Mortensen-Salov 
Leningrad 1984 
White's pawn weakr.esses give 
Black the basis of play in the 
endgame-it is precisely in the 
ending where White's inherent 
deficiency will manifest itself most 
prominently.

In the concluding discussion of 
the transition into minor-piece 
ending with undisturbed material

which the contestants retain two 
minor pieces, a knight and a 
bishop. The method of play bor­

endings, 
though 
it cannot 
be 
regarded as such; it is of definite 
interest to us.

Sunye--Van Riemsdijk 
San-Paulo 1983 
White has a definite positional 
advantage. He has two bishops 
and an active knight, threatening 
his oppcnent's queenside. Black 
must watch this very carefully. In 
this type of ending one of the 
main threats facing the defender is 
the opportunity for his opponent 
to exchange one of the pieces per­
forming an important defensive 
function. After the exchange it 
becomes difficult to protect the 
weak squares and their occupa­
tion by the enemy pieces.

Discussing simplifications in an 
endgame, we must, once more, 
remind ourselves of the particular 
subtleties of a pawn ending. It 
seems as if nowhere else in the 
game is it so easy to evaluate the 
position so completely and to 
realize one's advantage; and yet it 
is precisely in such simple endings 
that we may encounter the great­
est of surprises, the consequences 
of which it may not be possible to 
calculate or to correct when in 
time pressure. Moreover, as a re­
sult of play in a pawn endgame, 
new 
complications 
may 
arise, 
associated with a transition into a 
queen endgame-one of the most 
difficult and least studied of all 
endings.

To sum up-vigilance and even 
more vigilance is needed when 
transposing into a pawn endgame! 
It is well known that in an 
average game the role of pawns 
increases sharply in the endgame 
in comparison with the opening. 
Indeed, the problem in the end­
game is not the mating of the 
king, but the conversion of the 
pawn into a queen. So if in the 
opening we boldly sacrifice a 
pawn, and in the middlegame we 
do not consider material in an 
attack on the king, in the end­
game pawns become important 
active material and our attitude 
towards them changes, particu­
larly when there are no other 
pieces left on the board!

Alekhine-Yates 
Hamburg 1910 
An accurate appraisal of the 
position (a basic principle!) gives

The exchange of the last pieces 
on the board is a most crucial 
decision; even prominent chess­
players sometimes go astray in 
transposing play into a fatal pawn 
endgame. Often such mistaken 
exchanges are due to tiredness,

In the concluding discussion of 
the exchange into endings with 
material equality, we should con­
sider the psychological aspects 
associated with this problem. The 
point is that an exchange of just 
one pair of pieces into an ending 
with a limited amount of material 
remaining on the board can result 
in a significant and sometimes 
quite 
radical 
change 
in 
the 
required evaluation of the posi­
tion. Often one of the players is 
not ready for such a swift meta­
morphosis and cannot adjust him­
self psychologically to the new 
situation.

A dubious decision. White re­
moves the dangerous knight, but 
at what cost? Black's pawn confi­

The Exchange in Endgames 
With Material Inequality 
It has been pointed out on numer­
ous occasions, that simplification 
of the position is a most import­
ant method of realizing a material 
advantage. If we accept this pos­
tulate for the middlegame, from 
which we transpose by means of 
exchanges into the endgame with 
an increased role of the material 
advantage, then this proposition 
is even more applicable to end­
game type of positions. In many 
cases the exchange leads to well 
investigated 
technical 
endings, 
where the realization of a material 
advantage does not present any 
difficulties. 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
149 
In the middlegame it is most 
profitable to simplify in positions 
where the opponent's material 
deficiency is balanced 
out by 
greater activity of his pieces. In 
this case the exchange of these 
pieces is the simplest way to liqui­
date 
the 
opponent's initiative. 
Similarly in the endgame, it is 
important to try and exchange the 
adversaries' active pieces. But in 
endings in which the exchange of 
pieces results in a theoretically 
and technically won game, the 
exchange takes on even greater 
importance. 
Thus in the middlegame the 
exchange facilitates and prepares 
the realization of a material ad­
vantage, whilst in the endgame its 
realization 
is 
directly 
accom­
plished. 
An exchange from the middle­
game into the endgame in con­
ditions of material inequality can 
also be undertaken for totally op­
posite reasons, i.e. for defensive 
purposes. Thus, whilst in the mid­
dlegame the weaker side strives 
with the help of exchanges to 
neutralize his opponent's initia­
tive (in particular when the king is 
under attack), in the endgame, in 
conditions of material deficiency, 
the fundamental objective of the 
exchange is to guide the game into 
positions which are theoretically 
drawn, or at least to transpose 
into 
endings characteristic 
for 
their drawing tendencies (e.g. end­
games with bishops of opposite 
colour).

The Exchange in the Endgame 
Khalifman-Bareev

tage-two extra pawns in the end­

idea of the weaker side, having 
such a material deficiency, striv­
ing for the exchange? The young 
Master from Moscow, not long 
the under 16 World Champion, 
Evgeny Bareev already had a lot 
of experience and naturally real­
ized that his best chance in such a 
difficult situation was to transpose 
into an endgame with opposite 
coloured 
bishops; 
even 
if not 
drawn, the characteristics of the 
game would then be of a drawish 
tendency and White's problems 
would be maximized.

Nunn-Garcia 
Lugano 1983 
White, with an extra pawn, 
offers his opponent the exchange 
of his centralized knight for the 
black bishop with transition into 
a rook endgame. The reader is 
assured that the English grand­
master took his crucial step only 
after an evaluation of all the tact­
ical nuances, since in a rook end­
game 
Black's 
drawing chances 
would disappear.

White has very good chances of

Tire Exchange in the Endgame 
guide the endgame into a position 
of rook and knight against rook, 
with an unavoidable draw, or try 
to reach a rook endgame without 
pawns-also a theoretical draw. 
Black makes use of perhaps his 
best chance-by means of an un­
expected tactical manoeuvre he 
enforces a rook exchange and 
transposes play into a minor-piece 
endgame. Although White still 
has a draw, it is not simple to 
reach 
it-great

The exchange in the endgame is 
an important method of realizing 
a material advantage such as a 
rook against a minor piece. As a 
rule the advantage becomes much 
more significant (in the presence 
of pawns) with the exchange of 
other pieces. 
Anton-Lekrok 
2nd ICCF World Cup 1977-81 
White has the advantage of rook 
against bishop but it is not easy to 
evaluate the position. The black 
pieces are very active, White's c3 
pawn is very weak, his d5 passed 
pawn is under attack. In order to 
demonstrate 
Black's 
significant 
counter-chances in this situation, 
we only have to look at the game 
between

The German

important problem for White is to 
find a way to exchange rooks,

Black has an extra pawn, but 
his powerful pawn grouping in the 
centre cannot advance until the 
rooks are exchanged, since the 
white rooks are clearly more ac­
tive than their black colleagues 
and 
could 
set 
up 
unpleasant 
threats against the black king 
along the h-file. Moreover Black 
has to consider the possibility of

The white bishop is cut off from

In complex endings, particu­
larly in the presence of queens, the 
exploitation of a material advant­
age can often be hindered by the 
opponent's counterplay or by the 
creation of specific threats against 
the stronger sides' king. Usually 
in these cases the most important 
way to deal with the problem is to 
exchange queens and transpose 
into a rook or minor-piece end­
game. 
Miles-Portisch 
Plovdiv 1983 
Black has an extra pawn. The 
double b-pawns could become 
very dangerous in the endgame, 
but for the time being they are 
safely blockaded by White's bis­
hops. The main obstacle for the 
realization of Black's advantage is 
the white queen, firmly pinning 
down his bishop. In order to cut 
this Gordian knot it is necessary 
to exchange queens; the exper­
ienced Hungarian Grandmaster 
does not miss his chance.

Thus, there is material equality 
on the board, but black virtually 
has an extra passed pawn, and 
more importantly, his king is far 
more active than white's. This cir­
cumstance decides the outcome of 
the game. If White had refused 
this free gift of a pawn, then he 
would have been faced with a

il_O 
The exchange in a multi-piece 
ending, with the object of realiz­
ing a material advantage, does not 
always result in a technical end­
game by any means. Sometimes 
the exchange operation leads to a 
complex ending in which max­
imum effort is required from both 
players. We illustrate the com­
plexity associated with simplifica­
tion in a multi-piece ending with 
an endgame from the semifinal 
match of the Candidates for the 
Women's World Championship. 
Play is tense and far from being 
without any mistakes. 
Levitina-Aleksandria 
Dubna 1983 
The situation is extremely 
tense. Moreover, both players are 
short of time. White has an extra 
pawn and if she could consolidate 
her position, the material advan­
tage may become decisive. How­
ever, the experienced Georgian 
player forces her opponent's 
hands with the last move 29 . . .  
il_a4!. It is evident that White is 
trying to simplify the position, but 
how to accomplish this with a 
profitable result? There are two 
possibilities-3D 
,Sf5 + 
and 
<E)c6 +. The Leningrad Grand­
master chose the former, more 
complex move, suited to her com­
binational style. 
30 
.Sf5+ 
In the opinion of Levitina's 
trainer, the Leningrad master A. 
Ermolensky, whose analysis we 
will follow in this ending, the 
other method of simplification 
would have been much more pro­
fitable: 30 42)c6 + !  JLxc6 31 JLxc6

§Lxa6 
It is possible to summarize the 
exchange operations. The pos­
ition has simplified, but Black is 
freed from her exposed rook on 
a6, whilst the two bishops control 
the whole board and White's 
extra pawn is almost of no signi­
ficance. However, the resulting 
position cannot be classified as a 
minor-piece technical endgame. 
As before, there is still a lot of 
play left in the game. Both players 
are in time trouble; play con­
tinued:

Has 
Black 
profited 
by 
the 
exchange of pawns? Naturally 
any pawn exchange helps the 
defending side. But the above 
exchanges were in White's favour. 
The point is that the battle de­
velops into a narrower front, 
where the knight is not inferior to 
the bishop.

What is the conclusion of a

The result of the analysis shows 
that on 41 . . h6 the game would

favour-42 <£)e6 .il_d3! (bad is 42

the bishop for the knight and 
transition into a won endgame, in 
spite of the presence of 'opposite­
coloured' bishops) 43 .il_d5 (but 
now the exchange 43 §Lxd3 l!;?xe6 
would lead to a draw) 43 . . .  g6 
(the continuous chasing of the bis­
hop is unprofitable: 43 . . .  §Le4 44

the two extra pawns, the game 
would conclude with a draw in a 
bishop endgame; the king would 
be unable to support the advance 
of the g-pawn, and if it is 
exchanged for the a-pawn, again 
the result would be a draw, since 
the separation of two lines 
between the passed pawns, one of 
which being the knight's pawn, is 
not sufficient for victory. If the 
exchange is carried out by way of 
43 iJ.d5, then after 43 . . .  g6 the 
knight is deprived of the d4

with the simple 44 . . . iJ.xb5.

Black resigned. 
The above example leads us to 
the conclusion, that the exchange 
at material inequality could be 
beneficial not only to the stronger 
side. On the contrary, in many 
variations 
simplification 
was 
shown to be beneficial to the side 
with the material deficiency. 
Everything depends on the factual 
conditions (the activity of the 
pieces, the pawn configurations) 
and in particular on the residual 
material on the board after the 
exchange operations. Thus, Black 
struggled to exchange bishop for 
knight, even at the cost of losing 
yet another pawn, since the result­
ing endgame with opposite-col­
oured bishops is characteristic for 
its drawing tendencies. Hence, the 
exchange is a very important

weapon in the hands 
of the 
weaker side. This applies as much 
to the exchange of a piece-aim­
ing for an improved material rela­
tionship (with a view of securing a 
draw) as to pawn exchanges with 
the object of a simple decrease in 
the quantity of material on the 
board, which also often makes the 
realization of a material advant­
age more difficult. 
P. Nikolic-Cebalo 
Vr:iac 1983 
Black is a pawn down, with no 
visible 
compensation-White's 
pieces stand firmly, there is no 
evident weakness in his position. 
Often 
in 
such 
positions 
the 
weaker side 'goes under'. Let us 
follow 
how 
resourcefully 
and 
instructively Black conducts the 
ensuing struggle. 
23 
-deS 
A chessplayer with a material 
deficiency very 
often 
fearfully 
avoids simplification, since every 
exchange seems to diminish his 
drawing chances. 
Alas, a widespread, and fimda­
mentally incorrect reasoning. The 
The Exchange in the Endgame 
165 
only objective approach to the 
correct procedure is by means of 
an examination of the dynamics 
of the position and the qualitative 
changes 
resulting 
from 
the 
exchange. 
Let us return to the game in 
question. 
the 
white 
knight is 
beautifully placed on d3. Apart 
from its other functions, it con­
trols the important e5 square, 
where Black would like to place 
his bishop-an ideal place for 
covering both of his opponents 
flanks. Evidently this was the sort 
of reasoning of the Yugoslav in­
ternational master, playing with 
the black pieces; he was not afraid 
of simplifications on playing 23 
. . .  E)e5! 
24 
<i'lxeS 
In view of the threat 24 
<i'lg4, White is practically forced 
to exchange knights.

Black exchanged with gain of a

It's the endgame: nerther player has many pieces left on the board, but, 
nevertheless, that small advantage you've ben nursing through the 
middlegame is still there. How do you tum that tiny edge into a win? 
One answer is in this bok. Every great endgame player understands 
the ideas that undeie the need to exchange off pieces (or pawns) in 
order to make the most of an endgame, and these principles can be 
teamed. In this 1101ume you will find out how to: 
• 
Make use of a material or positional advantage 
• 
Move successfully from the middlegame to the endgame 
• 
Choose the right endgame 
• 
Assess the relative merits of pieces 
And along with all these techniques will come the understanding 
necessary for successful defense in the endgame.

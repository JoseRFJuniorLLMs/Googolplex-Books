Introduction




The 300 most important chess positions, demonstrating 

positional ideas

 in the opening, middlegame and ending, was originally an email course which I’ve run on two occasions. The course was labelled “Less is more” and was aimed at Swedish chessplayers, especially the juniors at my club SK Rockaden. The main idea was to study five positions very carefully each week and then meet on a regular basis and discuss some of them, which would sometimes be the starting point for training games by my students.




During the preparation of this book all the positions were checked for accuracy, after which some were omitted and replaced whilst still retaining more than two thirds from the original material. However, one important change in the present book is that there are now 150 positions representing the endgame and the same number for the opening and the middlegame combined. Originally the quota was 50 openings, 150 middlegames and 100 endgames.




The reason I made the changes was twofold: firstly, I thought too many important endgame positions were missing and, secondly, it’s hard to explain what is an opening position and a middlegame position and draw a consistent line of demarcation.




According to Alexei Suetin the middlegame begins when an attack is launched and I’m inclined to agree. This means, for example, 1 e4 c5 2 

♘

f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 

♘

xd4 

♘

f6 5 

♘

c3 g6 6 

♗

e3 

♗

g7 7 f3 0-0 8 

♕

d2 

♘

c6 9 

♗

c4 

♗

d7 10 0-0-0 

♖

c8 11 

♗

b3 

♘

e5 12 h4 is a middlegame position because the targets are already clear for both players. This also implies that the opening moves 1 e4 e5 2 

♘

f3 

♘

c6 3 

♗

c4 

♘

f6 4 

♘

g5 represent a middlegame for White but an opening for Black.




Such reasoning might well be confusing for a less advanced player so I have chosen to group openings and middlegames together without defining what the specific phase really is. For example, rapid piece development is more important in open positions but in closed positions the manoeuvre may be more important, thereby giving the opening more of a middlegame character. The hypermoderns even regarded the opening as a middlegame and since at a higher level it’s not clear what is what, I think it was most appropriate to treat the two phases as one.




Which phase is the most important one to study? In my opinion it’s the endgame because in that phase it’s easier to see how the chess pieces cooperate. By learning back to front, so to speak, it’s easier to understand 

how the pieces work best and how they should harmonise with each other in the opening or the middlegame – unless the balance has been seriously disturbed, when some kind of attack is the order of the day.




If you really want to learn how to play with bishop and knight there is no better way than to study the three different methods of checkmating the king. If you want to learn how to play with the bishop pair you should study the rare but important endgame two bishops versus one knight.




Another reason for stressing the value of the endgame is that multipiece endings need greater coverage since this type of ending is more or less ignored in chess literature. All endings with two pieces on each side are to a large extent under-represented. The same goes for three and four pieces each as well.




According to Speelman’s clever definition of the endgame, the total value of the pieces involved should not be more than thirteen points. This means that four minor pieces is regarded as an endgame but, strictly speaking, queen and rook is not – because of the increased danger to the king. As is well-known, the activity and safety of the king are other criteria to be taken into account in the endgame. In the present work, despite Speelman’s definition, I have chosen to regard all positions with two pieces each as endgames even if major pieces are involved and the king is far from safe.




The first time I became aware of the whole concept of positions containing positional ideas was when I studied 

Training for the Tournament Player

 by Dvoretsky and Yusupov in the 90s. The authors illustrated this highly important concept with a few positions. At the time I wasn’t fully aware of the importance and high practical value of the concept even though I had to a certain extent practised it unconsciously as a youngster. However, as time went by I realised that this has to a large extent been a forgotten and underestimated way of speeding up progress in chess.




Surprisingly, even to this day there is still no book focusing on this interesting concept of positional sketches. Perhaps one reason is that it’s been a well-hidden secret among the best trainers.




There are a few books by Lev Alburt with the 300 most important positions or 320 key positions but these mainly focus on tactics and are more fundamental in their approach. One of his books is actually titled 

300 Most Important Positions and Ideas.

 In addition there is another book by Ziyatdinov with the title 

GM-Ram: Essential Grandmaster Chess Knowledge

, which presents 300 positions, but unfortunately there are no solutions to them.




Not only is a knowledge of the most relevant positions and ideas in itself important but also the solutions should be presented in a pedagogical and easy-to-learn fashion in order to facilitate comprehension. After all, you are supposed to learn, understand and remember the positional ideas for all time and therefore you need to integrate the positions into your conscious chess 

thinking as early as possible in your life. Of course if you’ve been unable to learn appropriate chess thinking as a youngster then it’s still better to learn the ideas later, regardless of your age, than never to learn them at all.




To benefit from this approach to learning it’s vital to 

repeat

 the positions from time to time by looking at them again to see if you can instantly remember the ideas. If you have forgotten the solution or the technique required you should check it again and again until these are permanently embedded in your mind. Positional ideas are important in all phases of the game and that obviously includes the transitional phases going from the opening to the middlegame and from the middlegame (or multi-piece endgame) to the endgame.




Other related material can be found in two recent books by Arthur Van de Oudeweetering: 

Train Your Chess Pattern Recognition – Key Moves and Motifs in the Middlegame

. These focus on the opening and the middlegame and concentrate on chess pattern recognition which is another important component in the present book as well.




However, here I want to distill the most important positional ideas and techniques and focus solely on these. In other words, to facilitate chess training and make it more effective and concise. Why study so many positions if a smaller number is sufficient? By learning one key position, one idea or one technique you can apply it in many other situations.




The reason for the limited number of only 300 positions is motivated by the phrase 

“less is more”

. It’s also in accordance with the principle that 

the less you know the less you’ll forget.

 In other words it will be easier to remember 300 positional ideas rather than, let’s say, 1,000 ideas since you’ll have a smaller number of positions to learn and repeat on a regular basis.




I was first introduced to this clever training concept as a junior at the end of the 70s. My club SK-33 was located in the small town of Enköping and it helped me and a friend of mine to arrange a couple of meetings with Robert Danielsson, at the time a well-known specialist in teaching chess to children in Stockholm. He had written books and study material for beginners on a high pedagogical level. He was the right person to approach for chess hungry players like myself and Peter Fransson, who by the way later won the Swedish Junior Championship in 1980.




When we met we agreed to follow a strict and structured system which necessitated the study of five positions from Pachman’s 

Mittelspielpraxis im Schach

 and 

Endspielpraxis im Schach

 very carefully every week. If you follow such a schedule ambitiously it will take you approximately one year to assimilate the knowledge to be gained from the positions and utilise all this for a lifetime.




The reason for studying only five positions was to focus on those that are the most important and to concentrate solely on them. If you 

study too many positions and gloss over them too quickly you run an increased risk of eventually losing your discipline and then forget what you once endeavoured to learn.




The key is to learn slowly to give you time to reflect on the positions and if you can also discuss them with your friends so much the better. The best way to learn is actually to teach others so if you have this opportunity you should take advantage of it. Another way of learning, particularly endgame positions, is to play them out with a friend or a computer from both sides of the chessboard.




How do we know what are the 300 most important positions (positional ideas) in chess? Of course this is a relative and dynamic notion depending on your previous knowledge and experience. For a novice, a position showing how to mate with a queen against a king is important, but if you already know how to do this then it becomes superfluous and even a waste of time, unless you really do feel you need to review the process.




This book is aimed at a rating category from 1000 to 3000, which means I have chosen to satisfy all levels at the same time. This also implies that the lower the individual level, the more positions there are to be studied.




At the highest level, around 3000 Elo rating, it means you must be able to beat the computer when you have a queen versus a rook or when you are in possession of two bishops versus a knight. You must be able to defend in rook endings where you are two pawns down (rook pawn and bishop pawn) in time pressure, as well as holding the draw in queen endings where you are one or two pawns down, especially the notorious endgame rook pawn and knight pawn.




One way of addressing different levels at the same time is to start with an advanced position and then, as things become clearer, wait for something more basic to turn up. In such a situation there might be two numbered diagrams for the same game or they might be part of the variations at the end of the game.




Among the 300 most important positions you will not find any diagram or variation on how to win with a queen versus a lonely king. Nor will you find a numbered diagram on how to win with a queen against a knight. However, you will find one important position showing how to play with a queen against two knights and in the variations you will be shown how to win against one knight.




The only difference compared with a lone king is that you don’t need to think about pitfalls such as stalemate. You simply ignore the knight and play for mate rather than to win the knight. So, by showing a more advanced position, some easier ones will appear in the variations.







The following position is not regarded as important but it is embedded in the variations of the more complicated version where Black has two knights and therefore that position is regarded as the more important one.







Tablebase







The technique when playing against a lone knight is the same as if the king were alone, but in a way it’s made easier since there is no stalemate trap. The trick is to play for mate rather than to catch the knight:

Now you might perhaps argue that it’s very rare, if ever, to get the kind of material distribution where you have a queen against one or two knights, and that’s certainly true. I have never had it myself in a serious game but this fact is irrelevant when it comes to deciding whether a position is important or not. The whole concept is built on the idea that it isn’t only a matter of whether you encounter this or that position in practical play. What is of more and even vital importance is to gain a deeper appreciation of the 

inner qualities of the pieces

, their movements and their actual value in any specific position.




For example, the following famous study by Bilguer is presented as one of the 300 most important positions where you are supposed to understand, grasp and 

assimilate

 the most important idea(s). The queen and king are fighting against two knights and a king, and the only way to win and the important idea to grasp is to cut off the king on the last rank.

White to move







According to Pachman and Chéron White should enter the heart of Black’s position and play the centralising 1

♔

g7. However, it’s a forced mate in 43 moves if White plays the logical move 

1 

♕

 cutting off the king on the last rank.




The only way for the defending king to advance is by shielding it from the queen’s control of the seventh rank. which would mean placing the knights in passive positions. Note that White has reduced the value of the queen to the function of a mere rook. The centralising queen move to e6 is actually a mistake since after this Black can coordinate his forces. The moral here is that the queen should not act like a queen in this position. It should be humble and just behave like a rook, only controlling the seventh rank. The queen doesn’t need to demonstrate any of its 

diagonal powers yet. From time to time, even great players overlook the importance of the seventh rank when a queen is involved. Sometimes we have to forget that a queen is a queen and devalue it, transforming it into a mere rook or, can you imagine, a bishop. A truly strong queen exploits the fact that it can change roles between all the pieces of the board except the knight. Such a queen is for example the Réti-queen where the queen acts like a bishop in the corner of the board.







Here is one instructive example where Morphy, as a twelve-year-old, failed to use the queen as a rook on the seventh rank.







P. Morphy – A. Morphy

New Orleans 1949

White to move







Morphy played the nice and quiet centralising move

.




Note that this position isn’t regarded as important even though it is instructive. First of all it’s of a tactical nature and secondly it’s only given to show the main principle in its simplest form.




Another snippet concerning the seventh rank comes from the time when Bent Larsen went so far as to criticise Nimzowitsch for regarding the seventh rank as an element. However, it is indeed an extremely important element in chess and we’ll repeat it again and again whenever the major pieces are involved. Don’t miss the study by Studenetsky from 1939, 

position 220

, and you’ll get the point.




One more aspect when dealing with important positions is to observe how they can be transformed to other important positions. For example a multi-piece ending often transposes to an ending with one minor piece each.




A typical example is Fischer – Taimanov, 

position 269

.










Fischer – Taimanov

Candidates match, Vancouver 1971

White to move










First we have the multi-piece ending in itself starting at move 25.







Fischer – Taimanov

Candidates match, Vancouver 1971

White to move







Here the exchange of rooks has just taken place. At move 45 White is technically winning the bishop versus knight ending. Both these positions are regarded as important since they contain different ideas as well as different techniques in their respective positions.




Another distinction is that between easy and difficult positions. To be able to understand which is the more difficult we need to know the basic one. For example, if you want to learn how to hold the draw in an ending with two rooks each and four pawns versus three on the kingside as in 

position 273

...










Tukmakov – Wojtkiewicz

Bern 1993

White to move










...you first need to know how to hold the draw in a single rook ending, where you are up against a rook pawn and a bishop pawn, as in Gligoric – Smyslov, 

position 233

.







Gligorić – Smyslov

Moscow 1947

White to move







What is the most effective way to work through the 300 positions?




My recommendation is that you look at the diagram and cover up the solution. You then assess the position and try to find the right move, continuation, method, plan, technique or whatever, depending on the specific position you are examining.




If you are already familiar with it you go on to the next. If you aren’t familiar with it or need to refresh your knowledge or repeat the position, you can think around 5-30 minutes, depending on your playing strength and overall prior learning of positional ideas.




Let’s look at 

position 86

 from a game between Bogoljubow and Alekhine to exemplify in a more concrete form how to get to work on an important position.










Bogoljubow – Alekhine

World Championship match 1929

White to move







The important thing to understand about this position is that White has the 

initiative

 in spite of the bishops of opposite colour and the symmetrical formation – a factor which is underlined by the manoeuvre of the queen’s rook from a1-d1-d3-f3 with pressure on f7. This is the most important idea to remember and which essentially led to a win in this World Championship game against Alekhine, who by the way wasn’t particularly fond of defensive play.




When you play through the game to the end you will learn other things such as the art of 

playing over the whole board

 which was Bogoljubow’s speciality, as well as the 

psychological importance of having a slight initiative against an attacker

. So there are several important ideas to learn from this specific position alone and which you can use in many other positions.




When you have acquainted yourself with the key idea(s) you can repeat them after a week to find out how much you actually remember and understand. My advice is that you study five positions each week and then repeat them one week later and work on five more. This is in accordance with the principle “less is more” which means it’s better to do little than nothing, otherwise the risk increases that you’ll achieve nothing if you practice too quickly and too hard. And if you don’t repeat the positions you will forget them. Remember that repetition is at the heart of this pedagogic concept and the need to be pedagogical is your own responsibility in order to maximise the benefits of your training. After all, repetition is the mother of all learning, so don’t forget it if you have serious ambitions to develop your chess understanding as well as your practical playing skills.




You will notice that many of the longer variations are supported by smaller diagrams without numbers and the purpose is to make it easier to learn the specific theme(s) visually. Sometimes an interesting pawn ending can show up in another type of ending and then a small diagram presents it graphically. If the pawn ending is regarded as important the diagram has a number attached to it.




I wish you good luck with the 300 most important positions and positional ideas and don’t forget that the key to the whole concept is that fewer positions will mean that more positions will be remembered!

Part 1:




150 most important positions in the Opening and the Middlegame




1-30:

 Development of the Pieces




The key factor in the opening is to understand the value of development. The more open the position, the more important is development. In such situations it’s normal to develop all one’s pieces (including the queen’s rook!) before starting an attack. However, if the opening has a closed character, quick development is usually of less importance. Then manoeuvring will sometimes take precedence. The difficult question is what to do when the game is semi-open or half-closed and everything depends on the concrete nuances in the position.




Another important concept is the second wave of development, that is when one or several pieces move twice in the opening after the main development has more or less been completed. This sometimes signifies the transition between the opening and the middlegame, especially if there is a ready target to attack.




The first player to understand the importance of swift development in open games was Paul Morphy (1837-1884) and so we start off with him.




The following two positions are favourites of mine when I teach my students the value of development, rather than premature attacks or defences, in the early stages of the game.

Morphy – Stanley

USA 1857

White to move







This position arose in the Evans Gambit after: 1 e4 e5 2 

♘

xb4 5 c3 

♗

♗

b6.




9 

♘

c3!




Morphy was the first player in chess history to regularly play this apparently straightforward developing move of the knight. To this day it is considered the best move. White’s advantage lies in 

his strong control of the centre and advantage in time. White will have to consolidate these temporary advantages to gain full compensation for the sacrificed pawn.




Another great player, Adolf Anderssen, preferred the attacking 9 d5?! but ever since Morphy’s discovery that move was considered superficial. Although it has the advantage that the long dark-squared a1-h8 diagonal is opened, the classical a2-g8 diagonal remains blocked while Black’s bishop on b6 becomes stronger.




It’s more important to develop pieces instead of making useless short-term attacking or defensive moves. In other words one should avoid unproductive one-move threats and instead concentrate on long-term gains.

.




From his games we can deduce that it’s best to develop the pieces before starting an attack. And this position provides solid proof that Morphy’s principle of rapid development was superior to the style which preferred to attack before carrying out sufficient development.




For a less experienced player it might be tempting to play 5...

My recommendation is that you learn this model game by heart. In particular, moves 6 and 11 are important ideas to remember. When you are ahead in development you must open the central files. When the centre is opened you attack with all the forces you have at your disposal.

The queen is back home but it has cost time.




François-André Danican Philidor (1726-1795) made the interesting statement that a pawn is worth three tempi. If we count all the queen moves, White has made four yet his queen is still on d1. However, we have to deduct one tempo for Black’s bishop move to d7.




Now, according to Morphy’s principles, Black should open the game. Remember 6...e3! from the game Schulten – Morphy.




After 

9...e5

 there is no question Black has good compensation since he is ahead in development and has seized the initiative. Apart from that White has an additional problem in finding an active position for his queen’s bishop.

Tal – Smyslov

White to move







5 d4!




This isn’t a loss of time since the d7-knight hampers Black’s free development. Therefore it’s good for White to open the game. Less precise is the slower 5 g3, since it doesn’t exploit the fact that Black is behind in development on both wings.

Alekhine – Tartakower

Dresden 1926

White to move







White has the more active position and is ahead in development. For these reasons he should open the centre. Alekhine played the principled move:

Another way to open the position, but on the kingside, was 12 h4!? followed by h5. Note that 12 0-0? gives Black the opportunity to lock the position after 12...f4 and slow down the game. This is only to Black’s advantage as he lags behind in development.

 White’s threat is to invade on d5 with the knight. The routine move 11 cxd5? is a mistake, since after 11...

White to move







Black’s position is somewhat lacking in harmony and if it were his turn to move he would exchange the c6-knight and then move the e7-knight to c6. The e7-knight is 

superfluous

, to use Dvoretsky’s terminology, and in reality it’s the e7-knight which wants to be exchanged for the centralised knight on d4. In such a situation it’s sensible for White to put up an obstacle to Black’s plan.

The placement of the queen on e2 seems to be lacking in harmony with White’s position but has the advantage that from d1 his queen’s rook will have a good view along the semi-open d-file. Besides, White will avoid threats from one of the knights on the c4-square or perhaps f3 in the near future. The queen defends the g4-pawn and the light-squared bishop can be developed on g2.

b1




According to Bologan the white king is placed on the safe squares h1 or b1 in 90% of Sicilian Defence games. Such statistical information proves that there must be a very good reason if White chooses to avoid such a strong prophylactic and consolidating move before launching a real offensive, since once the attack has begun there is no turning back. One might also regard 

♔

b1 as the completion of queenside castling since the king might turn out to be exposed on the c1-h6 diagonal and in addition the a2-pawn can be vulnerable.

White’s control of the centre has been temporarily weakened so Black can start active play in the centre with 2...c6. This is best answered by 3 d4 exd4 (3...e4 is fully playable and is perhaps best exploited by 4 d5 isolating the far advanced e4-pawn.) 4

♘

f6 White has no useful move. 5 e3 (5 d3

♘

b4 and White can claim no advantage. It’s no coincidence that Black has such a good variation at his disposal, bearing in mind that both of his knights are well developed.




The third move played by White is a good illustration of the well-known principle advocated by Emanuel Lasker which states that knights ought to be developed before the bishops. There are two reasons for this: firstly, knights are stronger than bishops in the early part of the game and, secondly, it’s easier to develop the knights to squares where they belong compared to the bishops which have more squares to choose from.

♗

c5




This is Karpov’s variation in the Four Knights’ variation but another good option is 4...

♗

b4. Karpov preferred to play this strategically more ambitious continuation when he was up against heavyweights like Korchnoi or Kasparov. Black exerts pressure on the c3-knight and plans to eliminate it at any time, thereby improving his control of the light squares in the centre. This means that the control of the long light-squared diagonal is in danger after 

a preliminary exchange on c3 followed by ...e5-e4 and/or ...d7-d5. An effective way to avoid this strategical problem is to reply 5 

♘

d5. This is a good move favoured by intuitive players like Karpov, Tal and Gheorghiu.




5 

♘

f3 d6 6 d3 0-0 7 0-0




Black’s c5-bishop cooperates well with the pawn chain c7-d6-e5-(f4). This is the same kind of cooperation White’s g2-bishop enjoys alongside the pawn chain e2-d3-c4-(b5) and sometimes even a6! The goal for both players is to improve the activity of their bishops.




7...a6 8 a3

 was agreed.




Note that it’s harder for Black to activate the c- and f-pawns because of the knights that stand in their way, White’s attack on the queenside is normally faster than Black’s on the other flank. A good introduction to learn how to play this variation is to study Karpov’s games with Black where he developed the bishop to both c5 and b4.




We will continue the discussion on giving consideration to the development of the bishop(s) with the help of a few instructive examples. We will also touch on the subject of when it’s advisable to prevent the development of the opponent’s bishop.

Capablanca – Janowski

San Sebastian 1911

White to move







In 

My Chess Career

 Capablanca writes that his move 

13 

♗

e2

 was a mistake. He realised that 13 g3 was the correct move but was afraid to be criticised for constructing such a weakened pawn formation on the kingside. Because of this reason alone Capablanca opted to go against his better judgement. He points out that it was his first major tournament and he didn’t want to be scolded for making pointless pawn moves which is something weak players are prone to do.




13...

♗

e6 14 

♗

f3




It’s better to maintain the bishop on the e2 square. To play an extended fianchetto (

♗

f3 instead of 

♗

g2) has the drawback that it’s easier to attack it with a knight on e5. However, it has the advantage of not having to make a weakening pawn move like g2-g3.

After his 23

 move Capablanca managed to turn the tables and after 66 moves he emerged victorious. It’s noticeable that the pawn would have been better placed on g3 to prevent threats against h2. Moreover if the bishop had been developed to g2 earlier in the game it would have exerted pressure on the d5-pawn.




What’s interesting about the whole story is that if you check the opinion of 

Komodo 11

 it actually prefers 11

Keres – Fine

Ostende 1937

White to move







According to Keres White has two fundamental plans:




The first one is to exploit the pawn majority in the centre and play for d4-d5 establishing a passed pawn.




The second is about concentrating all his pieces on the black kingside and in that way utilising the centre and his space advantage.




In the game Keres played the flexible 

11 

♗

c4

 which is the standard move in this position. 

Compared with 11 

♗

e2 which keeps the d4-d5 push in mind, or 11 

♗

d3 planning a kingside attack, the advantage of Keres’s move is that both options are still open. All the same it seems that Keres has forgotten one typical plan which has been used by Petrosian. That is to play for a minority attack on the queenside with a4-a5, especially when Black has played ...b6.

Capablanca’s recommendation is to wait with the development of the c8-bishop and instead improve the placement of the king, rook, knight and dark-squared bishop.

...and Black is slightly better although the game ended in a draw after 41 moves.




Black displayed good timing with the development of his queenside bishop. Other players who were very skilful with regard to how and when to develop this bishop, were Lasker and Réti. It’s a matter of developing the pieces correctly and in the right order, while at the same time never losing focus on the centre – the most important area of the board.

Nepomniachtchi – Nakamura

Wijk aan Zee 2011

Black to move







Sometimes it’s more important to disturb White’s harmony than to concentrate on development. Here Nakamura came up with the fantastic idea

 where Black sacrifices a tempo to provoke the pawn move to f3.

Mnatsakanian – Petrosian

Moscow 1964

Black to move







At times it’s more important to prevent the opponent from developing his bishop rather than developing your own. Here Petrosian played the clever 

11...

♘

 to exploit the fact that White has been left with a rather passive dark-squared bishop because of making too many pawn moves. Now the active developing move 

♗

g5 is effectively prevented. Petrosian’s move is illuminating, since it shows that one must always be aware of the opponent’s development as well.

When one has the bishop pair it sometimes makes sense to open the position rather than develop the pieces. Here are two examples on that theme.







25







Verlinsky – Alekhine

All-Russian Championship 1909

Black to move







Black has the bishop pair so it’s in his interest to open the position. This explains:




9...c4! 10 bxc4

.




White has to accept the pawn sacrifice because otherwise Black gets rid of his doubled pawn and still has the initiative thanks to his bishop pair.




10...

10...0-0-0 was correct. If Black is unable to win back the pawn, he would still have compensation in view of White’s damaged queenside pawns.

An aggressively inclined player would prefer

. The main idea of the set-up is to develop the king’s rook by means of the pawn push f2-f4 and, if possible, f4-f5. This aggressive placement of the rooks focuses on the centre and the kingside and suits attacking players much better than the development of the rooks to c1 and d1.

Keres, like Larsen, was well-known for his fondness for attacking play but this time he chose quieter play despite the fact that a sharper continuation was available. This is perhaps one example of why Keres and Spassky were called universal players because they felt at home in both types of games.

Karpov – Korchnoi

London 1984

White to move







Moves such as 13 

♕

b3, 13 

♖

b1 or 13 

♖

c1 look like normal means of development but Karpov thought more deeply than that. He played 

13 

♖

e1!

 and realised that the key to maintaining the balance is 

flexibility. The move Karpov made is useful whatever happens in the future. This is positional play at a high level and the move that maintains optimal tension in the position.




Karpov’s move has the intention to meet a later ...f5-f4 with exf4 or possibly e2-e4. If Black plays ...

♘

f6-e4 White can move the c3-knight and plan a future f2-f3. Then the rook is correctly placed on e1 since the e3-pawn is defended and e2-e4 can be prepared. It’s also possible for Black to play ...c6 to meet b5 with ...c5. After dxc5 Black wants to play ...d5-d4 and then the rook will also be well placed on e1. It also makes sense to keep the queen on d1 (and avoid 

♕

b3) in case Black plans a kingside attack.

It’s a good idea to compare Karpov’s 13

Normally we move each piece only once in the opening. If we move any of them a second time after completing development we can talk of a second wave of development.







29







Rotlewi – Rubinstein

Lodz 1907

Black to move







The above position is completely symmetrical except for the fact that Black has a rook on d8 and is to move. This is actually one of the first games showing how to benefit from a slight lead in development (two half moves) in a symmetrical position.




Rubinstein played

The best continuation is to start a second wave of development and take the initiative as soon as possible. The routine 15...

 Exchange of Material




Most exchanges of material affect the evaluation of a position one way or another but some exchanges definitely do, such as bishop for knight, bad bishop for good bishop, four-rook-swap and, above all, the exchange of queens. The last mentioned exchange often signifies a transition from middlegame to endgame. We’ll look at all the individual pieces but first here is an example showing how and when to exchange pawns.

Capablanca – Alexander

This kind of hypermodern queen

Even a seemingly harmless exchange of a pair of knights can lead to a substantial advantage. Here Botvinnik played

 forcing the exchange of the last pair of knights. It results in permanent weaknesses on the dark squares in the centre, particularly d4. The d4-square will be an important springboard to enter Black’s position. The move played also vacates the f3 square for the bishop to put the d5-pawn under pressure.

Here Fischer played the surprising move

.




Fischer, like Capablanca, was a true master when it came to the conversion of advantages. By exchanging Black’s “bad bishop,” which was about to be liberated after ...

♗

b5, White can in the near future use the queenside rook to penetrate the black position via the c6- or the c7-square. Note that the exchange also represents a transition phase between the middlegame and the endgame, according to Speelman’s definition that was mentioned in the introduction. The routine move 22 a4 gives Black better defensive resources after 22...

22...

White’s advantageous trade also opened the c-file and in combination with Black’s pawn weaknesses on a6 and d5 these factors will prove to be decisive.

Black stops White from playing the rook to c6 but now the rook comes to the seventh rank instead.

Black must prevent the other rook from invading on e7 where it would be a mighty force in conjunction with its colleague on c7. To place two rooks on the seventh rank is the ultimate dream for two healthy rooks.

Carlsen – Anand

18 

♘

c7! 

♖

ag8 19 

♘

xe6!

. It might seem illogical to exchange in this way but even a bad bishop can have important defensive functions such as protecting pawns. The Polish grandmaster Krasenkow, when annotating the game for Chessbase, wrote: “A good idea. White exploits the fact that Black cannot recapture with his f7 pawn to exchange the theoretically “bad” e6 bishop, which in fact is the main defender of the black pawns.”

One can clearly see that Black has three positional weaknesses on f5, d5 and f7, which result from the fact that the important defensive e6-bishop is gone. Besides, in general the combination of rook and bishop versus rook and knight is a little stronger when there are pawns on both sides of the board – and here many of Black’s pawns are fixed on white squares! At the right moment the king can advance to f4 and commence an attack on the black pawns. Carlsen won the endgame after 77 moves.

Kasparov – Short

38







Staunton – Williams

London 1851

White to move







One of the main differences between the long-range bishop and the short-range knight is that often the bishop has more possibilities of exchanging a knight than vice versa. This is not only due to its long-range capability but also because of its ability to pin.

This is a surprising decision by Stein, who showed that he was far from being a dogmatic player wanting to keep the bishop pair at all costs. Another player who doesn’t mind parting with the bishop pair is the reigning World Champion Magnus Carlsen. What is more astonishing about Stein’s decision is the fact that he has worked hard to get a strong bishop on g7 only to exchange it for a knight which looks pretty harmless on c3.

Botvinnik – Tal

World Championship match,

Moscow 1961

White to move







Here the exchange 

23 

♗

xf6! gxf6

 and the follow up 

24 b4

 can be regarded as an example of routine technique in its most positive sense and in the spirit of Capablanca.




White´s bishop exchange weakens Black’s pawn structure and the further goal is to strive for a four-rook-swap to remove all possible counterplay with the heavy pieces. Botvinnik’s annotation here reads: “Black has been left with weak pawns, and the ending (with or without the rooks) will be difficult for him.”

Botvinnik recommended 24...

Flohr – Bondarevsky

Leningrad/Moscow 1939

White to move







One of the overall ideas when playing against the Stonewall is to exchange all the minor pieces except Black’s light-squared bishop and keep one knight which can be placed on the weakened e5-square. In this position we can see that White has already exchanged the dark-squared bishop and that exchange has reduced Black’s attacking chances on the kingside. Flohr wrote that in his practical experience an e5-knight will prove stronger than a light-squared bishop, which to a large extent will be restricted by its own pawns.

Flohr makes good use of the e5-knight to activate the king since Black has no check on g6. Black was under severe pressure and eventually had to throw in the towel after 77 moves.




The idea to remember when playing against the Stonewall is to exchange the right pieces. The next example will also show this.

Schlechter – John

Barmen 1905

White to move







If you haven’t seen the following idea before, it’s easy to overlook or underestimate. The objective is to dismantle the Stonewall structure with 

14 

♗

xe4! fxe4

 followed by the pawn break 

15 f3

 opening the e-file and at the same time getting rid of the doubled f-pawn.




15...exf3 16 

♖

ce1







This method of dealing with Black’s centralised knight is well worth remembering since it’s more effective than playing the traditional f2-f3 to drive away the e4-knight. Remember that White’s bishop isn’t necessarily stronger than Black’s as his pawns also help to restrict the white bishop. For this reason alone it makes sense to keep knights on the board as they can later benefit from the weak dark squares.

White has now forced further weaknesses on the dark f6 and h6 squares. It’s instructive to see how Schlechter exploits them.







26 b4!




Schlechter preferred to play over the whole board – as did Bogoljubow and Alekhine a little later. White is superior in the centre and on both wings and can choose whether to break through on the kingside or on the other flank. Therefore it’s good to create the conditions for a breakthrough with b4-b5 while preparing the same situation on the kingside. It’s impossible for Black to defend against two attacks on two different fronts due to his cramped game. In this way White takes advantage of his space advantage as well as Black’s bad bishop.

Grekov wrote the following about this position: “On looking at the apparently so solid position of White, who himself is ready to attack on the king’s flank, it is hard to believe that in only a dozen moves his king position, at present far removed from the influence of the black pieces, will be completely routed, the more so, since the player of the white pieces was a prominent master of defence. However, his opponent was an incomparable master of attack...”

White to move







Suba played the paradoxical 

10 

♗

xf6 

♗

xf6 11 

♕

d3

. Why exchange pieces when White has a space advantage?




Black’s Hedgehog position is an extremely harmonious opening if White tries to exploit his space advantage in the traditional way, since then Black’s counterplay can be tremendously strong. Black’s position is very flexible and his pieces look more passive than they really are – and for this reason it’s regarded as correct to exchange several minor pieces. In accordance with the same principle it has been discovered that it’s good to exchange queens, since then it will be easier to advance the pawns on the wings without worrying too much about dangerous counterattacks.




The moral of the story is that one shouldn’t always avoid piece exchanges when having a space advantage, since everything depends on the concrete nuances of the position. Be aware of the fact that the Hedgehog is an exception to the rule.

It might seem strange that White exchanges his “good bishop” for Black’s “bad bishop” but the reason is that Black’s pawns on white squares will be weaker after the exchange. Maybe it was this concept Larsen thought about when he once wrote that beginner’s books always lie when discussing the concept good and bad bishop. Very often the passive bishop, as Philidor already realised in the 18

th

 century, is strong in defence. From that perspective it’s not at all strange to exchange such a defensive bishop.




Kramnik said about his move: “My opponent underestimated the standard priyome ‘A bad bishop is also one that can defend many pawns.’ Once the bishops are gone, Black has to lose the a- or d-pawn.”

Gelfand – Malakhov

Sochi 2005

White to move







14 

♗

f4!




White avoids the exchange of the dark-squared bishops for two reasons:




a) White has a space advantage and should avoid the exchange, in accordance with Tarrasch’s famous rule. In this particular case it would only have helped Black’s queen find a good square on e7. White has a space advantage since the c4-pawn is more active than the c6-pawn and it’s easier for White to play e3-e4 than it is for Black to play ...e6-e5.




b) It’s useless and planless to exchange since Black has no weaknesses and so it would then be easier for him to take advantage of his flexible structure. For example after 14 

♗

xe7 

♕

xe7 15 e4 dxc4 16 bxc4 c5 it is White who risks being saddled with pawn weaknesses.




14...f5




Black transposes to a Stonewall structure to prevent White from 

playing e3-e4, but his position loses flexibility. Gelfand writes insightfully in 

Positional Decision Making

 that in the Stonewall the g2-bishop is normally worse than a “bad” bishop on b7, a6 or h5. It’s not even certain that a bishop on b1 is better but it can be easier to exchange than when it is fianchettoed.




15 

♖

The bishop has no function here apart from increasing Black’s control of the e5-square and making room for his queen on e7.

And now the strange-looking move 17 

♘

d2. With regard to this passive knight retreat Gelfand has written in the above-mentioned book that a friend of his had studied all of Fischer’s games and noticed that he never retreated his pieces. If his pieces were attacked he counterattacked rather than retreated. Gelfand was very impressed by this observation and thereafter always looked for counterattacks in similar situations.




White could play the more active 17

Although Gelfand eventually won the game, surprisingly he missed the opportunity of 22 

♗

c7!, which is a well-known device to take over a file, on the same lines as the model game Karpov – Unzicker, which is presented as 

position 82

 in the section on manoeuvres. White doubles rooks behind the protected bishop and in this clever way conquers the c-file and wins the strategical battle in a much more efficient manner.




In the game the incorrect 

22 h3?

 was played. A strong alternative to the Karpov-plan just mentioned was to establish a pawn wave on the kingside. White could increase his dark-square control with 22 g3! followed by 

♔

g2 and h2-h4. This kind of positional manoeuvre would consolidate and improve White’s game so much that he is then positionally winning. This idea of strong dark-square control is reminiscent of the famous game Schlechter – John, 

position 43

.







54







Bronstein – Gaevsky

Dnepropetrovsk 1939

White to move







Bronstein played 

9 

♗

f1

.




At first glance it might seem strange to develop the bishop to b5 and then go back to f1, so what’s the point? The reason is that White has a space advantage, an e4-pawn versus a d6-pawn, and so Black wants to exchange as many minor pieces as possible to create more space for his pieces. By placing the bishop on f1 Black can only exchange one knight.




This kind of move made by Bronstein is a standard choice which appears in many other positions to create a state of harmony. The bishop isn’t in the way of any other pieces on f1, since there is no other piece which needs that square for manoeuvre.




If White had instead placed the bishop on e2 it would have been in the way of the rook, queen and the two knights and then we could say that White’s position lacked harmony. In the same way as a Mozart symphony, where no bars can be exchanged for any others, the bishop had to find the truly correct location and consider the prospects of the whole position and not only its own. After all, on e2 it would work in two directions, whereas now it only operates on the f1-a6 diagonal.




As far as possible it is important to avoid putting pieces where they are in each other’s way. This is sometimes difficult to avoid in the opening phase when the board is more crowded, but in this particular position White has managed this very well. The only concession is that the f1-bishop works on one diagonal only but that is a small price to play for harmony. Compare 

this bishop with Black’s on e7 which for the moment cannot even move. However, eventually it will probably be located on f8 to create harmony and then be activated on g7.




Alternatives to Bronstein’s move were either 9 

♗

xc6 or 9 

♘

xc6 with various pros and cons. It’s a matter of taste which you play but the main thing is to agree to the exchange of only one minor piece so as to be able to profit from the space advantage.

Here the same idea appears again. Black wants White to exchange on a4 and improve the pawn structure even further. Black could have exchanged on a1 or moved the rook to c8 since White has tactical weaknesses in his position on e4, c2 and b2 as well as a badly placed king and a passive knight on b3. To borrow an expression by GM Suba: the “bad” bishop on e7 protects a good pawn on d6. However, the bishop may have a more positive future since it can sometimes find a good location on g5 or manoeuvre to the classical diagonal on b6 via d8.

What determined the strength of the bishop pair was the light-squared bishop which decided the game. This was the main idea of the pawn sacrifice: to provoke White into exchanging his light-squared bishop for the knight. Janowski is an interesting player to study if you want to focus on effective handling of the bishop pair – because Janowski simply loved the two bishops.




Sometimes it’s difficult to decide whether it’s better to keep one rook or both rooks on the board and this decision often represents the difference between a win and a draw. Here are a few examples designed to unravel the interesting positional problem of when and why to exchange rook(s).







58







Vogt – Rukavina

Olympiad, Skopje 1972

One of White’s ideas to play for a win is to advance f5-f6. This plan will be significantly stronger if all rooks are swapped, since that would eliminate possible counterplay as well as creating tactical weaknesses in Black’s position.

Vidmar – Nimzowitsch

Many players would probably have moved one of the rooks to d8 and thereby removed the inherent dynamic in the position after all the exchanges on the d-file had taken place. However, instead Nimzowitsch played the profound:




19...

.




Black must exploit his qualitative pawns on e5, f5 and g5 by placing the major pieces behind these pawns. White does not have any dangerous square of invasion on the d-file. White’s rook can come to d6 but it doesn’t mean anything since there are no weaknesses on the sixth rank. 19...

When White has a structural weakness, like here on d4 where Black wants to place his knight, it’s advisable for Black to avoid the exchange of rooks. This is because it’s easier to realise the advantage of a strong outpost if there are rooks on the board. Moreover White’s rooks will become passive as a consequence of the strong centralised knight.

In contrast to his contemporaries, Morphy realised that when you are ahead in material it makes sense to simplify by exchanging queens. First of all you eliminate counter-chances and then secondly you approach an endgame. We will not look at such obvious cases but instead examine other perspectives why an exchange of queens might be useful.

It’s logical to strive for an exchange of queens, so as to take the sting out of White’s advantage in space. Also it wasn’t clear what else the queen might do. It’s a clever idea to develop the bishop to d6 (instead of e7) and make possible the queen manoeuvre to f6 challenging White’s active queen.

Smyslov – Tal

Candidates Tournament,

White to move







15 

♕

d3!




White benefits from an exchange of queens, for which the doubled pawn on the d-file is a small price to pay. The reason is that White can then start play on the c-file and together with the bishop pair and the strong a5-pawn this will ensure at least a slight advantage. Note that White also prepares c2-c4 if Black should avoid the exchange.

This very concrete move is a reaction to Black’s simple plan of ...

d3 as well as 13

65-108:

 Manoeuvring




All pieces have a specific task and this is most clearly seen in the manoeuvre. It is particularly in closed or locked positions that manoeuvring skill becomes most important. Other situations are when one of the players has the initiative or more space, since then it’s easier to regroup one’s forces more efficiently.




First the knight’s capabilities are shown, then the capabilities of the bishop, rook and queen. Two examples of king manoeuvring can be found in 

positions 87

 and 

88

.




Another aspect of manoeuvring involves several pieces where one important concept is the principle of exploiting two weaknesses and playing over the whole board.




65-78: The Knight Manoeuvre




With its exotic way of moving, the knight is the most magical piece on the chessboard and most of us have problems dealing with it optimally. Bronstein wrote that we usually devote our main attention to the long-range pieces (the queen, rooks and bishops) and discover too late the danger of pawns and knights when they have already crossed the fifth rank. “What evidently operates here is the same law as in life, which forces us when crossing the street to keep a constant look out for a speeding cyclist, in order to avoid having an accident.”




Such an “accident” has happened to me more than once and a typical example is the following:

Engqvist – Matros

Black crossed the “equator”, to use Bronstein’s terminology, with

Benko – Stein

Interzonal, Amsterdam 1964

Black to move







A simple form of manoeuvring is when a player seeks to improve the position of a certain piece in a few moves. Stein played 

35...

♘

e8

. The knight is better placed on d6 where it not only puts pressure on the e4-pawn and the c4-square but also prepares a future ...f7-f5 at a suitable moment.




One might also say that this manoeuvre is in accordance with Philidor’s principle which states that the mobility of the pawns is the most important factor. This principle is normally valid in closed positions but sometimes also in semi-closed positions like here.

Compared with the previous examples

The knight isn’t doing anything on f3 so where should it manoeuvre?

Lékó – Kramnik

Budapest 2001

Black to move







Kramnik is especially skilful when it comes to knight manoeuvres so let’s see one more example.




Here he played 

22...

♘

e7!!

. What’s going on, since the e4-bishop dominates the knight?




During the press conference Kramnik said that he wanted to be active on the kingside. And what activation! This is an instructive example showing how much kinetic energy a knight really can possess when the circumstances are right. Bronstein once wrote that “what is 

difficult is to see a knight from afar, when this piece is only preparing for a deep raid into your defensive lines.” We are actually missing the fact that the knight is a long-range piece in slow motion.

Steinitz – Lasker

World Championship match,

New York 1894

White to move







Steinitz played the retreating knight manoeuvre:




18 

♘

h3! 

♘

c5 19 

♘

f2




According to Steinitz’s theories a flank attack can only succeed with a secure centre. Note that the Spanish bishop was previously placed on b3, exerting pressure on f7, and that the knight was placed on g5 in an attacking position. Now these two pieces have the defensive functions of securing the central structure, in particular the d3-square. The flexibility of how to use the pieces, the oscillation between attacking and defending, is typical of Steinitz.




19...b5 20 g5 h5







21 

♘

f5!




Now there is a switch from defence to attack. Another passive knight suddenly springs to life as well as the c1-bishop.




21...gxf5 22 exf5 f6 23 g6 

♘

xg6 24 fxg6 

♗

xg6 25 

♖

g1

 and Steinitz had a strong attack resulting in a win after 42 moves.




The process of manoeuvring a knight to g5 and then back to h3 is also a modern idea explored in detail by GM Adrian Michalchisin on one of his DVDs about making plans. Among other modern players, Korchnoi has been an exponent of this interesting idea.







73







Engqvist – Heinola

Stockholm 2008

White to move







According to a famous Russian rule, if it’s not possible to find an appropriate plan one should improve the worst placed piece – because this is an effective mini-plan in itself.




But what to do if you are saddled with two passive pieces as in this position? White’s problem pieces are the rook on a1 and the knight on b3. Which of these pieces ought to be moved?




A classical principle is to move the minor piece before the major piece but of course this must be checked when making calculations. In the game I didn’t play the best move.




I continued with 24 

♖

ad1?! when my opponent responded 24...

♗

g4. While I was thinking whether to play the weakening 25 f3 or the tempo losing 25 

♖

a1 my opponent’s cell phone rang so I won the game immediately, in accordance with the strict rules we had for this occasion. I was lucky because Black’s position is to be preferred. The rook move to 

d1 invited dynamics but these were only in Black’s favour as his bishops are strong, particularly the one on the a7-g1 diagonal.




Correct was 

24 

♘

e2!




Another solution to the problem was 24 

♘

c1! 

♗

g4 25 

♘

ce2 which I missed during the game.




24...

♗

g4 25 

♘

bd4







For some inexplicable reason I completely overlooked this possibility of manoeuvring one of the knights to e2.




White’s position is advantageous from a static perspective and the knight manoeuvre is in accordance with the static nature of the position.




It’s sometimes easy to make routine moves, bringing the rook from the left hand corner into the centre, but on this occasion it wasn’t the best option. What is correct is to manoeuvre the wrongly placed knight on b3 to e2 and this could have been achieved in two different ways! Knights are peculiar pieces indeed and we must always treat them in the way they deserve. This is also the main reason we have several examples with knight manoeuvres.

Colle – Capablanca

Carlsbad 1929

Black to move







What to do with the threatened knight when there are several options? Capablanca’s solution was...




13...

Of course Black should pressurise the strong d4-knight. It’s stronger than the bishop on c1. 13...

d3? is a positional mistake due to 14

The beginning of an extraordinary knight manoeuvre to a3 via d2 and b1. Another way of tackling the position was 27 axb5 axb5 28 

♗

a7 (Karpov’s ingenious idea which we will discuss later in more detail.) followed by

You often see a Steinitz manoeuvre from b1-d2-f1-g3 but here Fischer does this the other way around, a reversed Steinitz manoeuvre, and that is highly unusual and original!




Spassky was an active player who didn’t like passive positions and that is why the slightly desperate 

29...

♘

 followed.




You will see more such psychological moves by Spassky when looking at 

positions 148-149

. Spassky wants to sacrifice one of his knights in exchange for smashing White’s strong pawn centre but of course it isn’t correct since White still has his positional pressure.

Engqvist – J. Eriksson

Stockholm 2017

White to move







In this position I unfortunately missed the nice knight manoeuvre:




19 

♘

b5!




This concept of a double knight attack on the fifth rank is inspired by the maxim that one should always analyse aggressive variations which lead to a forced entry to the enemy position. This is Fischer’s well-known principle which states that you should only go forward with the pieces, not backwards. With the aggressive knight move White exploits the fact that Black hasn’t yet had time to play one of the moves ...a6 or ...c6 to secure the b5-square.

Pomar – Alekhine

Madrid 1945

White to move







Pomar retreated with

 and that retreat triggered Alekhine to give his student Pomar one really good piece of advice. He said: “There are positions where a combination is obligatory.” The world champion recommended instead 19 b4 and if 19...bxc5 (Alekhine answered 19...

b5 with a very dangerous attack.




Komodo 11

 doesn’t agree and mentions 21...a6 with a slight advantage to Black. This correction doesn’t mean that Alekhine’s pedagogic piece of advice was useless, on the contrary. 

Komodo 11

 actually recommends 19 

♘

a6 with a slight advantage to White, proving that Alekhine was right after all with his insight that the piece should not have retreated.




After the passive move in the game White’s position lost its sting and following

Alekhine wanted to tell his student that White had to make an important decision: whether to sacrifice the knight with 19 b4, since that was the only way to keep the momentum (energy) in the position, or at worst move the knight. But according to 

Komodo

 it was correct to go forward with the knight in the spirit of Fischer.







78







Rubinstein – Tarrasch

Carlsbad 1923

White to move







Rubinstein was a great master of playing against an isolated pawn and he introduced important ideas relating to the appropriate technique. In this classical position he played 

11 

♘

e1!?

. White plans the manoeuvre of the knight to d3 and then to f4 where it pressurises the d5-pawn. It’s not at all mandatory to blockade the isolani with a knight on d4 as Nimzowitsch recommended. A serious alternative option is to follow in Rubinstein’s footsteps and play around the isolani and perhaps even capture the pawn.

This ends the section on knight manoeuvres. We now move on to bishop manoeuvres.




79-87: The Bishop Manoeuvre




Bronstein used to say that “the queen’s bishop will never find a better target than the black g7-pawn.” So here we have a strong argument for 1 b3 if it were not for 1...e5 blocking the diagonal. To find a good diagonal for the bishop, where it can achieve maximum power, is always a matter of adapting to the pawn structure. There is no reason to play, for example, 1 d4 

♘

f6 2 

♗

f4 if Black can reply 2...d6, literally killing the bishop. So, better to be flexible and play 2 

♘

f3 and if 2...d5 then 3 

♗

f4.




The first three positions show how the future prospects for a bishop may be improved by a paradoxical retreat of this piece to its starting square. In this way it could well find a more effective diagonal. The next three 

positions show how to take over a file by placing a bishop on the seventh rank in front of a rook. The last three positions handle a manoeuvre from the classical diagonal to the b1-h7 diagonal, bishops of opposite colour and the bishop pair in a symmetrical position.

Andersson – Browne

A bishop manoeuvre to e3 or f4 is a typical idea in the Hedgehog and therefore Andersson played

Kasparov – Petrosian

Tilburg 1981

White to move







11 

♗

f1!




A paradoxical retreat which shows a deep understanding of the requirements of the position. White wants to defend the h3-pawn so it will be possible to castle on the kingside. The bishop will be well placed on g2, observing the long white diagonal, and it will make it more difficult for Black to attack White’s central pawn with ...c5. This clever bishop move helps White to maintain his strong position in the centre.




Kasparov mentions in his annotations that when he stood up from the board after this excellent move, Spassky slapped him on the shoulder saying: “A good manoeuvre!”




It’s noticeable that Petrosian had this position twice with the white pieces but he didn’t play this clever preventive bishop manoeuvre. But, then again, we should remember that Petrosian was famous for his own profound manoeuvring skills. Instead he preferred the space-gaining move 10 g5.

Black needs to play a passive move with his c-pawn to neutralise the long white diagonal.

Here Karpov played the stunning

 – a revolutionary idea which avoids any exchanges of major pieces. Often in the Spanish Game White plays on the kingside while Black gets counterplay on the other flank. But after the original move played in the game Black’s counterplay on the queenside is over. It is an important idea to remember whenever it’s possible to control a file by doubling or tripling.

Then I analysed the text move which I immediately associated with the famous bishop move to a7 played in the above-mentioned Karpov – Unzicker game. The point of the move in Karpov’s game was to double rooks on the a-file behind the bishop. Here I was happy to apply the same idea since I wanted to keep the game alive by retaining rooks on the board and playing for an attack.

White has played in accordance with the Karpov model and tried to take control of the c-file by first blocking it with the bishop deep down the file and then double his heavy pieces behind it. However, the problem is that in this position the concept doesn’t work since Black can just open another file.

White’s plan is simply to play

♗

xb7!? wins a pawn but slows down the pace of White’s positional plan. According to Philidor a pawn is worth three tempi in the opening. Here White loses two tempi, one to take the pawn and one to return to base. Philidor’s tempo rule hasn’t the same validity in the middlegame since everything is much more complicated, due to the fact that all the pieces have been mobilised. Yet the question remains whether it is worth two tempi to grab the pawn and apparently Botvinnik didn’t think so.




A flexible move, and probably the most precise, was 35

Bogoljubow – Alekhine

Superficially this position looks more equal than it really is since things are not quite what they seem. The reason is the bishops of opposite colours.

Englisch – Steinitz

London 1883

Black to move







Here Steinitz showed that if Black has the bishop pair in a symmetrical position with an open centre, there is a three-step-plan to exploit his advantage. Black’s main goal is to immobilise White’s minor pieces, especially the knight.




Step 1 is to remove the outposts from the knight, in this case the d4-square.




Step 2 is to drive the knight to a passive position with the help of the rook pawn.




Step 3 is to open the game and exploit the passive knight.




Steinitz played

.




This important move immobilises the bishop on the e3-a7 diagonal while the b3-knight cannot go to c5 or a5.

A typical advantage of the bishop pair is that it’s often easier to activate the king than it is for the defender in this type of position. If White’s king goes to f1 Black can check on c4 and if White prepares f3 and

This is also a typical move in positions where the bishop is stronger than the knight. Black’s c4-bishop dominates the c1-knight. This ends step 2. Step 3 is to open the position and exploit Black’s more active position.

This ends the section handling manoeuvring with minor pieces. We now move on to major pieces, beginning with the rook.




88-98: The Rook Manoeuvre




The rook is probably the most difficult piece to manoeuvre. In the beginning of the game and in the early middlegame it’s sometimes impossible to know where the rook is best placed from a long-term perspective. In the endgame there are many open files and ranks and it’s not always easy to calculate the correct continuation.

Kovačević – Seirawan

Wijk aan Zee 1980

If players like Ivanchuk and Shirov seem to come from another tactical planet the same could be said about Seirawan regarding his positional play. It looks like White is controlling the h-file but in reality it’s Black who will take over that file after the highly original

Karpov – Kasparov

World Championship match,

Moscow 1985

Black to move







It’s not easy to decide how to develop the rooks in this position. Black wants to expand on the queenside with ...b7-b5 very soon and then b8 would be an attractive square. But if …b7-b5 is met by axb5 you want a rook on a8. The c-file is semi-open and so it’s natural to place a rook on c8. The d8-square also looks useful since most of the time it’s good to have a rook behind a central pawn, especially if it advances. Black can prepare either ...d6-d5 or ...e6-e5 and also be ready in case White plays e4-e5. The e8-square is also interesting since Black can counter White’s f4-f5 advance and prepare ...e6-e5 when the pawn is placed on f4. It’s also good to have a rook on f8 when White goes for g4-g5, since the break ...f7-f6 might become important.




Kasparov played

Black understands that White wants to break through with f4-f5 and so prepares to make this less appetising by doubling rooks on the 

e-file. It’s an unbelievable rook manoeuvre never to be forgotten. It might seem strange to double rooks on a closed file but this is how to use rooks at a higher level. Incredibly skilful play by Kasparov even if it’s a slight exaggeration to claim that he became World Champion because of his ability to play with the rooks! Interestingly, though, Kasparov attached the punctuation ?! to his move and sought to improve with the immediate 24…f5.

Tarrasch – Lasker

World Championship match,

Düsseldorf/Münich 1908

Black to move







Black’s position looks rather inconspicuous and is a good example of how one can turn “nothing” into “something” with the help of piece activity. Lasker played the impressive move 

15...

♖

e5!

.




This is the most active as well as the best move, at least from a psychological point of view. It represents the second phase of development where some of the pieces try to penetrate deeper into the position. This is normally something for the knight but here this mission is accomplished by the rook which seeks play on the rank rather than the file. There were several candidate moves such as 15...

♘

c5 (the computer’s preference) 15...

♘

f8, 15...

♘

b6 and 15...a6 with the cheapo 16 

♘

xc7?? 

♖

c8. However, all of these continuations must be regarded as slightly more passive than Lasker’s choice. Lasker understood very well the value of using the rook along the rank, 

especially when playing against mere mortals!




16 

♘

d4




The point of Black’s original and creative rook move wasn’t just to protect the c7-pawn (16 

♘

xc7?? 

♖

c5) but also to be able to play:







16...

♖

c5!

.




A very thoughtful concept by Lasker. White already has two rooks in play and Black tries to compensate for this by playing actively with his only developed rook and by using the e5-square as a pivot (manoeuvring square). Black’s e-file is actually longer than White’s and this fact is exploited to the maximum by Lasker.

The knight helps to create an outpost for the rook on c4.

Tarrasch plays according to classical principles and tries to cut off the rook from the centre, the e5-square. However, Lasker, who played beyond the classical principles developed by Steinitz and Tarrasch, has other plans for this rook. 18

Stein was a true master when it came to reaching positions with strong tensions. Superficially it might seem that White’s passed pawns on c4 and d5 are more dangerous than Black’s on d4 and e5, since the bishop on e4 helps to blockade them and can support its own with the c4-c5 push at the right moment. However, it’s not that simple. The natural continuation 18...

Bologan – Ruzele

Kramatorsk 1989

White to move







As a rule, positions where White has an isolated d4-pawn versus a c6-pawn are better for White than playing with an isolani against an e6-pawn. The main reason is that White’s bishop, stationed on the classical diagonal, has greater scope all the way to the vulnerable f7-pawn. If Black places his knight on d5 the bishop can switch to the b1-h7 diagonal. White can easily exploit the open e-file and use the e5-square as an aggressive outpost. Despite the fact that Black has the open c8-h3 diagonal at his disposal the bishop is often unable to find a suitable square.




Bologan played the strong 

21 

♖

 which provokes an exchange as the rook is in a strong position where it threatens a doubling of rooks as well as taking twice on d5.

22 dxe5







White has used Philidor’s method to improve his pawn structure, i.e. the outpost on e5 was exploited to make possible an exchange which at the same time improved his pawn structure. White’s isolated pawn is certainly artificially isolated on e5, since it is far advanced compared 

with his other pawns, but it’s easy to protect on e5 and it has an aggressive position which offers dangerous outposts on f6 and possibly d6. White’s next goal is to manoeuvre the knight to f6.

Reinhardt – Lombardy

Carlsen – Ivanchuk

Foros 2008

White to move







28 

♖

a1!




Carlsen believes the rook belongs on a2 where it can prepare a4-a5 and manoeuvre to c2 in some variations. This last mentioned idea to get out of the firing line of the bishop on the h6-c1 diagonal, stems from a game Petrosian – Gufeld, played in the Soviet Championship 1960. In that game Petrosian kept clear of the opponent’s dark-squared bishop along the h6-c1 diagonal by playing the moves a2-a4, b2-b3, 

♖

a1-a2-c2, 

♖

f1-b1-b2. Notice that by playing on the second rank with the rooks, the last rank is “removed” and so the board is reduced to seven ranks instead of eight. It’s because of such model examples that Carlsen, with his extraordinary memory, can make use of the most important classical ideas from the past.

Let’s now move on to queen manoeuvres.




99-102 The Queen Manoeuvre




The queen is the strongest tactical piece on the board and therefore it’s a good idea to centralise it whenever possible. When there are no targets around it must be content with controlling a file and acting like a rook, or controlling a diagonal and assisting or replacing a bishop. However, when there are targets like unprotected pieces, weak pawns or an exposed king, it shows its teeth and then you think: this isn’t a queen, it’s an octopus.

The regrouping is now over. Capablanca has set up “Alekhine’s gun” reversing the positions of his queen and rook. Normally it’s best to have the queen behind the two rooks and second-best is to have it behind the first rook. In this position Black must reckon with the threat on d6.

Karpov – Kasparov

World Championship match,

Moscow 1984

Black to move







Kasparov writes the following after the strong queen manoeuvre 

16...

♕

e8!




“Black has set up an original battery on the e-file and in the best traditions of the Tarrasch Defence he does not intend to defend the d5-pawn with all his might, but wants to initiate play on the c- and e-files, exploiting the activity of his light-squared bishop.”




Note that all Black’s pieces are active with the exception of the f6-knight which has a defensive function. The bishop on g4 exerts pressure on the e2-pawn and this is against Nimzowitsch’s advice that you should place the bishop on e6. In modern chess it’s activity that counts and this is the sole idea of the Tarrasch Defence or whenever you are saddled with an isolani in the 

middle of the board. Kasparov is playing according to the spirit of the system and therefore applies pressure on the central files as well as controlling the important outposts on c4 and e4.

Black fully exploits the potential of all his men – major and minor or pieces alike. Nevertheless Karpov still managed to win the game in 42 moves after Kasparov made some mistakes in the time scramble.




We will now concentrate on positions where several pieces are involved in intricate manoeuvring. Not only by using manoeuvring squares but also by making use of the whole board as well as applying the principle of two weaknesses.




103-108 Manoeuvring with Several Pieces

Steinitz – Showalter

Vienna 1898

White to move







This position is both a forerunner and a basic example of how White can play on both wings simultaneously.




White has a large advantage in terrain due to the strongly defended pawns on the fifth rank as well as the super knight on d4, hitting the e6-weakness. The best way to exploit the huge space advantage is by opening a file. The important question though is not what to do (c3-c4) but when to do it. Steinitz’s fundamental plan is to commence manoeuvring on the kingside in order to lure the pieces to that sector of the board and then open the 

queenside. This is in accordance with the concept of two weaknesses.

Black’s king can be placed on f5 after White has captured the f7-pawn and then the knight manoeuvre to b3 or c2 wins. Note that the game will be decided on a black square (a1!) and that is also typical of a white-square 

strategy as Bronstein so insightfully once remarked.




A very nice game played by Lasker who showed how to conduct a white-square strategy when the opponent has an isolani. It’s not necessarily the isolated pawn that is weak but rather the white squares around it. This concept has been very well elaborated by Nimzowitsch in his book 

My System.




This encounter must be regarded as one of the most important model games to show how to manoeuvre when the opponent has a complex of weaknesses of the same colour. Study it thoroughly and you will be well rewarded in your own games.

Bogoljubow – Réti

Berlin 1919

White to move







The move 

11 a4!

 looks like preparation for an attack on the queenside but the move primarily prepares a knight manoeuvre to c4. Later this knight will manoeuvre to g2 via e3 after White has played the g-pawn to g4. You might say that White’s pawn move on the left flank prepares an attack on the right!

♗

15...

♘

f4 16 

♗

xf4 exf4 17 

♘

g2




White’s original knight manoeuvre from c4 to g2 has been successful and White has the slightly better position. Most important here is not 

the fact that White could play stronger but rather that one should remember to watch out for moves on one side (11 a4) which can help to make progress on the other side (

♘

c4-e3, g4 and 

♘

g2). This is the ideal way to play over the whole board and Bogoljubow repeatedly showed that he was a master of this difficult kind of play.




His method of starting an attack on one wing as preparation for an attack on the other was a new strategic idea and it’s only right to mention that Bogoljubow was the first to cultivate play over the whole board. In fact, as we have just seen, this was even more important for him than gain of material.




I recommend a deep study of his best games so you can master the complicated art of playing over the whole board. Apart from Bogoljubow, other great attackers like Alekhine and Kasparov have also embraced this method of combat.

Jianjun Xie – Engqvist

Shenzhen 2012

White to move







When I was in China I was stunned by the strong manoeuvring ability of my opponent – a strong FM rated over 2400 Elo points. In this position, which arose in the exchange variation of the Slav, Jianjun Xie continued

 planning 

♘

f4-h5 followed by 

♕

g4 and 

♗

e5. This is a logical plan in view of the fact that Black has slightly weakened his king’s position with ...h7-h6.




As a matter of a fact one might say that an early exponent of this idea was Rubinstein who, in his game against Sämisch at Carlsbad 1929, induced a black knight to a5 by playing b4-b5 and then started play on the kingside in order to exploit the distant knight’s inability to get over to the defence. Nimzowitsch was very impressed by this idea and described it thoroughly in the book 

Carlsbad International Chess Tournament 1929.

 If you are not familiar with it, then it is well worth a look.

 with an active position for White. In this way White has involved all his pieces in the kingside operation. By reducing Black’s pieces to passivity, White can more easily choose the best plan. White’s dream, if he cannot break through on the kingside, is to exchange to an endgame where the bishop pair might be a decisive factor.

White has achieved one of his goals and now has the bishop pair against two knights as well as a queenside pawn majority. White won a well played endgame after 87 moves.




Good examples of playing over the whole board as well as showing how the principle of two weaknesses works can be seen in the following two positions.







107







Botvinnik – Zagoriansky

Sverdlovsk 1943

White to move







Black’s weakness on d5 is not enough for White to win the game so he needs to create a second weakness on the kingside. Here White can exploit the fact that Black has already weakened his kingside with ...h7-h6. If this wasn’t the case White would have had to manoeuvre to force Black to weaken himself on the kingside. But now White can open the g-file with g4-g5 and the second weakness will be the vulnerable black king.




Botvinnik played 

25 g4!

.




GM Baburin writes in 

Winning Pawn Structures – The Isolated Queen’s Pawn and its Derivatives (1998)

 that “Computers will not be able to come up with such a move for years to come, at least I hope not!” Twenty years later, he is to a certain extent correct because 

Komodo 11

 suggests moves that mean that White should continue to tack about a little before embarking on his final plan. One of the moves that is suggested is 25 g3 with the idea of securing the kingsde with

Preparations for f2-f4 can wait, since Black is not keen on playing ...f7-f5. White first wants to immobilise Black’s pawn majority on the queenside. If White manages to generate pressure on the queenside he can shift the attack from that side of the board to the king’s flank. 13

 Pawn-Play and the Centre




We first look at pawn-play on the wing and then pawn-play in the centre. The main idea is to use one or two pawns for positional gain.




109-114: Pawn-Play on the Wing




We’ll look at four different situations. How to use a pawn to immobilise a knight, how to prevent an important break, how to play for your own breaks and how to prevent a battery from becoming operational.

Atkins – Capablanca

London 1922

Black to move







Black wants to exploit the bad position of the b3-knight. Capablanca played 

14...a5!

. By placing the pawns on a5 and b6, the b3 knight becomes passive and the weak b5-square can be defended by ...

♘

a7 if necessary. This is a set-up to remember! The alternative was 14...b6 15

Flohr – Spielmann

Bled 1931

White to move







19 a4!




This is an interesting counter-plan played by Flohr and Botvinnik to prevent Black from liberating himself by ...c5. Black cannot move the b5-pawn because of the battery on e2 and d3 and it’s difficult for him to do anything since ...c5 loses a pawn on b5.




19...g6 20 

♘

d2




White’s knight obviously wants to go to c5 to block the c6-pawn and lock in the b7-bishop. Maybe it could also go to a5 in some positions so as to put pressure on c6, but then a doubling of rooks would probably be required.




20...e5 21 

♘

e4 exd4 22 exd4




White’s strategy, which started with 19 a4, has been successful. His strong control of c5 means that the b7-bishop is practically dead – or else a “joke” to use an expression by Mikhalchisin.




The most important factor when exploiting weak squares is to consider the opponent’s pieces which are trapped behind, in this case the b7-bishop. The strategy White has adopted here is always meaningful, since it effectively means playing with an extra piece. In this case the d3-bishop is decidedly stronger than its black counterpart.

Fischer – Unzicker

Olympiad, Siegen 1970

White to move







14 f5!




This idea Fischer presumably borrowed from Lasker, who played a similar move against Capablanca in Saint Petersburg 1914. However, the first time Lasker played it was in his World Championship match against Steinitz in 1894. Then he tried it again against Janowski in another world title match in 1909. Lasker won all three games in which he adopted this idea. Lasker’s move was revolutionary since it went against the classical school. After all, White is left with a backward pawn on e4, a weak square on e5 and a devalued pawn majority on the kingside. Not even the computer is fond of the idea so what was Lasker doing?




One of Fischer’s arguments was that if you want to get squares you’ve got to give squares. Nothing is for free in chess, not even squares! Here White concedes the e5-square but in exchange he gains control of e6 and at the same time confines the c8-bishop to passivity. The f6-pawn has been fixed and can be a future target with g4-g5. Presumably these fine points were taken into account by Lasker as well.




14...

♕

e7 15 

♗

Fischer follows the same scheme that Lasker successfully employed against Capablanca. White wants to exchange the dark-squared bishops and split the opponent’s bishop pair. Then White can prepare the future advance g4-g5.

European Championship 1999

Black to move

Observe that sometimes it doesn’t matter if one bishop becomes bad or passive since Black has managed to make two knights ineffective! Chess is “give and take” and nothing is for free since everything comes at a cost – although in this case having his dark-squared bishop confined to passivity was a small price to pay, considering what Black got in exchange.

In a rapid game Romanishin played the simulated pawn sacrifice:

The main idea is to take away the e5-square from Black’s pieces. while the next move secures the e4-square for White’s pieces.




14...fxe5?




Black could have side-stepped his opponent’s conception by playing 14...

c7, but after 15 f5 

♗

f7 16 exf6 gxf6 17

15 f5







This is the clever idea. Now that Black’s pawn has been lured to e5 the f-pawn passes it and the e4-square is in White’s possession.




In this way White has gained an important square (space) in the centre and that is worth a pawn since Black cannot place a piece in the centre himself.




White is actually positionally winning here.

Gulko probably forgot that the en passant capture 17 exd6 wasn’t an option here due to the pin on the fifth rank. Such moves can easily be missed if one forgets about geometrical patterns, in this case the length of the fifth rank. After this mistake White’s game went downhill very quickly.

Andersson – Lahti

Lidköping 1969

White to move







As a youngster Ulf Andersson demonstrated another way to exploit a situation where there are two queens on the fifth rank. Black has tried to take advantage of the fact that the f5-pawn is pinned but White can turn this to his advantage by playing 

18 e5!

.




This beautiful and at the same time logical breakthrough prepares the path for an attack on the black king. Note that such a move is in accordance with the principles laid out in Morphy’s games, see 

positions 3

Udovčić – Petrosian

Zagreb 1965

Black to move







Grandmasters Bronstein and Davies taught me that in such a situation you should always claim space in the centre because then you equalise immediately. So in this position the correct move is 

3...e5!

.




The game Engqvist – Davies, Wrexham 1995, went 1 

♘

f3 g6 2 g3 

♗

g7







...and now I played the inaccurate 3 

♗

g2?! which was justly criticised after the game by Bronstein and Davies who recommended 3 d4!. Obviously Black responded 3...e5 with immediate equalisation.




A recent example from the Swedish Championship at Ronneby 2018 was Von Bahr – Grandelius where 1 

♘

d7!? was played. The obvious move now was 3 d4! but instead the less principled 3 c4 was played.







122







Kveinys – Engqvist

Stockholm 1996

Black to move







Here I played what was to my eyes the reasonable move 

6...e6?!

 and after the game my opponent asked me why I didn’t play 6...e5 in one move instead of two. My argument was that I considered it inaccurate to place the bishop on g4 in the 2 d3 variation of the Caro-Kann, since it’s usually better placed on c8. After the immediate 6...e5 7 e4 dxe4 8 dxe4 

♗

c5 Kveinys considered the position completely equal. White might continue 9 

♕

e1 0-0 10 h3 and Black must make the important decision whether to exchange on f3 or retreat with either 10...

♗

h5 or 10...

♗

e6, but the position is definitely equal.




The game continued

“Now you lose a tempo” Kveinys told me after the game, and he’s right, but what else could I do?




10 h3




White now enjoys a slight advantage whatever reply is made with the bishop. It’s not so strange. I’d actually lost a move and the balance was tipped in White’s favour, if only slightly – but an initiative is an initiative.




The moral of these two little stories is that if you can claim space in one move then do it! I’ve already showed two situations where I’ve been criticised by experienced grandmasters for not doing it and I believe they are right, at least from the viewpoint of principles regarding how to relate to the centre and how to relate to activity versus passivity.







123







Vidmar – Nimzowitsch

Carlsbad 1929

Black to move







8...cxd4!




Nimzowitsch writes in the tournament book that this is an original concept which among other ideas is designed to prevent White from playing dxc5 followed by e4. It’s interesting that 

Komodo 10

 also thinks this is the best continuation.




9 exd4




As a rule 9 cxd4 is unsuitable when White cannot place his knight on c3.




9...

♘

h5!




The exploitation of the weak f4 square, accompanied by strong control of the b8-h2 diagonal, is the main idea of the early capture on d4. Another consideration is that now White cannot easily carry out the traditional plan with a knight outpost on e5.

124







Neikirch – Botvinnik

Olympiad, Leipzig 1960

Black to move







A correct understanding of the centre is probably the most important element in chess strategy. The centre is important in all phases of the game and not only the opening.




15...f6!




Black could play 15...

♗

b7 to gain time and control the light squares in the centre, but it wouldn’t solve Black’s problem due to the strong e5-pawn. The drawback of 15...dxe5 is that following 16 fxe5 White would liberate his c1-bishop after 16...f6 17

Bernstein – Capablanca

Moscow 1914

Black to move







15...c4!




When this strong move was played by Capablanca it was initially regarded as a mistake by both critics and onlookers. The main reason was that it reduced Black’s influence on the d4 square and therefore made the advance of the d5 pawn more difficult. Also the d5-pawn itself had became weaker. However, Capablanca realised the value of the move and described it in detail in 

My Chess Career.




White’s general plan was to put pressure on the hanging pawns with his rooks on c1 and d1 and Black would defend the pawns correspondingly by placing his rooks on d8 and c8. The e7-bishop defended the c5-pawn. Capablanca asked himself if it was possible to activate Black’s position and that is how he found 15...c4.




The important point of Capablanca’s revolutionary move is that the e7-bishop becomes an active piece. Another important point is that the b2-pawn becomes a tactical weakness which Black can attack along the b-file. A third important issue is that if White blockades the d5-pawn by placing his knight on d4 the attack on the d-file is temporarily stopped.




In addition to these arguments Nimzowitsch wrote in his classic 

My System

 that 15...c4 makes the hanging pawns relatively secure, because after this move Black has only one weakness instead of two.

Capablanca recommended 16 e4 to simplify the game but Bernstein preferred to put pressure on the centre, since it was regarded as a good policy, and played for a win.

126







Petrosian – Spassky

Santa Monica 1966

White to move







Here is another position with hanging pawns. The main drawback with hanging pawns is that they are grateful objects of attack. After every exchange their potential strength is reduced and in the endgame they are as a rule weak. The strength of hanging pawns lies in their mobility and ability to create sharp situations. It should be remembered that the semi-open e- and b-files have the potential for great activity and can be used as springboards to develop aggressive play.




Here there is one disadvantage for Black, namely that the b7-bishop stands in the way on the b-file. Compared with the previous position Black’s position is more passive and White is in a position to start a systematic siege of Black’s centre.

L. Karlsson – Engqvist

Stockholm 1997

White to move







Unusual but dynamic pawn structures are one of Swedish GM Lars Karlsson’s hallmarks.




Here I was happy with the situation and thought I had equalised. I have stopped the dangerous break a4-a5 since then I would reply ...

♘

e5 with the double idea ...

♘

f3+ and ...

♘

c6. A pawn break in the centre with d3-d4 only results in hanging pawns and I didn’t mind putting pressure on them. For some reason I forgot about the most important pawn advance which was so close to Nimzowitsch’s spirit, namely...




17 f4!




Now I suddenly had intricate positional problems to solve and felt I was being punished for having made some careless exchanges of a bunch of minor pieces earlier in the game. I also felt my game was rather uncomfortable due to potentially annoying aggressive moves like f4-f5 and 

♘

d5.




I responded with the slightly desperate 

17...f5

. After the game I asked Karlsson what I should have played instead, but he gave me no answer. At home I checked with 

Fritz 6

 which recommended the quiet developing move 17...

♖

ad8 with the verdict that the position is equal. Many years later I confirmed it with 

Komodo 11

 which also recommended the rook move and with approximately the same evaluation as 

Fritz 6

.







My opponent played 

18 e4!?

 but more precise was actually 18 a4! since it’s not possible to stop a4-a5 and a subsequent weakness on b6. It had no bearing on the practical result because after 39 moves I missed a 

mate in a dead lost position. He had a queen on f6 and a knight on f7 protected by a pawn on e6 and I overlooked 39 

♕

h8 mate. Obviously I had forgotten that the knight controlled h8.




After this crush he told me I’d been completely out of it during the game. Maybe so, but other reasons were presumably that I wasn’t used to this kind of pawn structure nor the protected knight on f7 which controlled the all-important corner square.

Stein – Rodriguez

Havana 1968

White to move







Stein played 

19 e4! 

♘

c7 20 d4

.




This idea has been known ever since the game Réti – Rubinstein, Carlsbad 1923. It means that White’s two pawn moves express a concept known as “the hypermodern paradox”. This was coined by Reuben Fine in his book 

The World’s Great Chess Games

 and the expression is defined like this: “If you occupy the center immediately, the pawns soon become weakened, and the opponent will then be able to occupy it. However, this means that it is not occupation that is bad, but in many cases immediate occupation.”




20...exd4 21

Paradoxically it’s White who has a pawn in the centre but three moves ago it was Black. Here the e4-pawn is strong since White has active pieces to support his centre.

Kasparov – Karpov

World Championship match,

New York 1990

White to move







Kasparov played 

19 f3!

.




This strong and solid move was actually discovered by Timoschenko with the principal idea of just maintaining the nice classical centre and avoiding any change in its structure, otherwise it would be 

easier for Black to attack it. However, one important point of this deceptive and simple move, is that the three black pieces on a6, b7 and e8 will have no work to do. The rook on a6 is out of play when White is solid in the centre.




As a matter of a fact the three other moves Kasparov analyses in his famous white cover books give Black an easier game since the central structure will then be easier to crack. Black’s reward after breaking up the centre is his more active pieces. Let’s look at Black’s activity in the following variations:

c3

Now the question is whether White should go for a short pawn chain or a long one.




5 

♘

ce2




Réti writes in his ground-breaking 

Masters of the Chess Board

 that it’s a mistake to place the pawns on c3 and f4 since this plan is too ambitious. In principle White wants to suffocate Black but as Steinitz in his insightful way taught us you must always play in accordance with the demands of the position.




From that perspective it’s right to be happy with a shorter pawn chain by playing an immediate 5 f4 and answering 5...c5 with 6 dxc5. White should be satisfied with the spearhead at e5 and give up any attempts to defend d4 as well.




Black hasn’t made any mistake and according to the principle of accumulation one should just gather small advantages, such as the space White gains from having his pawns on e5 and f4.




According to the principle of proportion, one of Lasker’s famous theories, one should make a move proportionate to the advantage one has in the position. Here White’s advantage is not big enough to be able to maintain the whole pawn chain with the support of c2-c3 and f2-f4.

131-147:

 Play on the Wings




The last part in this section deals with play on the wings. First the minority attack is discussed, followed by the queenside and kingside attack. We will mainly deal with different methods of managing the pawns rather than pieces, with the exception of 

position 145

 which deals with one of Fischer’s favourite themes: “empty squares”.




131-135: The Minority Attack







131







Karpov – Ljubojević

Linares 1989

White to move







The minority attack is a common positional theme in modern chess. This type of structure often arises in the exchange variation of the Queen’s Gambit, as seen here, and the exchange variation of the Caro-Kann with the black pieces. White strives for b2-b4-b5 to weaken Black’s queenside formation, in particular the c6-pawn. If Black captures the b5-pawn the d5-pawn will become a weakness and if Black allows White to capture on c6 then the c6-pawn will be a permanent weakness.




13 b4 a6




It’s useful to get rid of the black a-pawn since it risks becoming a weakness when White carries out his minority attack.

Karpov eventually won by applying pressure against Black’s pawn weaknesses on a6 and e4. His timing of the b4-b5 break was impressive. He waited patiently until all the minor pieces had been exchanged to minimise Black’s counterplay on the kingside.




Karpov’s studious technique made it only a matter of time before Black’s weaknesses were exploited one after another in an endgame with only major pieces on the board.

One of the main drawbacks of the minority attack is that if Black manages to exchange the light-squared bishops the c4-square might become available for a black knight. However, in the present position White has a strong central thrust.

This routine move gives Black counterplay along the f8-a3 diagonal. Correct was 13

. This idea originates from one of the great experts of the Queen’s Gambit, Boris Spassky. The point is that White cannot play the knight to c5 via a4 and besides this Black has got a nice outpost on b4 for his bishop. White must have felt he had been fooled in this position – so remember not to play a2-a4 without thinking!

White made some errors in the process of dealing with the minority attack. It required exact play to stand up against it and that is not always easy in a practical game. An important plan to remember!




136-137: Queenside Attack




Next follow two model examples of how to attack the queenside when there is no minority or majority. It’s rather a matter of qualitative pawns since it’s obvious that a quantitative majority in itself is a signal for a duly prepared assault, especially when the attacker also controls an open central file.







136







Botvinnik – Boleslavsky

Moscow 1939

White to move







22 b4!




Black’s b6-knight invites the advance of the pawns on the queenside. This means that White’s pawns will represent a qualitative pawn majority, to borrow an expression from Nimzowitsch, rather than quantitative. White’s superiority on the queenside lies in the fact that his pawns are more active than Black’s and create more space.

Mihalchisin – Djurić

Copenhagen 1979

White to move







11 a4




The idea is to start an attack on the queenside by playing a5-a6 followed b4-b5 and undermining the light squares in Black’s position. This plan made a deep impression on GM Adrian Mikhalchisin (once upon a time Karpov’s trainer) when GM Yossif Dorfman (Kasparov’s erstwhile assistant) introduced it to him. Remember that it’s useless to attack on the kingside or in the centre. 11 e4?! weakens the d4-square and is strongly answered by 11...e5! when it’s White who must fight for a draw.




11...a5




Now it looks like White is weak on b4 but since the black knight has already developed to d7 it’s difficult to exploit it.




White continues

b5 is obviously a “knightmare” for Black.

Black has a weakness on b7 and White can attack it by placing the queen on a2 and follow it up with a knight manoeuvre to c5 and then a doubling of the rooks on the b-file will finish the job. You can only say: “Poor b7-pawn!”




138-147: Kingside Attack




The first thing to learn is how to attack the opponent’s king when the centre is closed or secure. You are recommended to study several Steinitz games in depth. Here only a few positions are presented but some other important games are mentioned in the annotations.







138







Dubois – Steinitz

Steinitz played 

7...g5




Another good move was 7...

♘

a5 to secure the bishop pair.

♗

g3 h5







Preparing a pawn storm against White’s king. This game is regarded as the prototype of how to attack the king with a pawn storm. The main reason such an attack has good prospects of success is because it’s difficult for the defender to counter with a breakthrough in the centre since it is of a closed character.

♗

d7 but this is shown to be inferior if we check the variations with the computer.




10 

♘

g5 0-0!




It may seem paradoxical to castle kingside but the king is actually quite safe on g8. At the same time the g3-bishop bites on granite. It’s only in conjunction with c3 and d4 that the g3-bishop can come alive but that isn’t easy to achieve.

Steinitz – Lasker

World Championship match,

New York 1894

White to move







11 h4!




White launches a direct attack since the black king has already taken up permanent residence on the kingside, while his own central position is solid. This procedure could justly be called the Steinitz plan. The prototype is Dubois – Steinitz, London 1862, but Steinitz – Chigorin, Game 4, World Championship match 1892, and Steinitz – Blackburne, London 1876, are other famous games you can study to obtain a more complete picture of this important concept.




The Russian theoretician Suetin has made the very interesting statement that this kind of attacking move marks the transition from the opening to the middlegame.

Lasker – Capablanca

Moscow 1935

White to move







White is very solid in the centre with pawns on d4 and c3. His central position hasn’t been under attack 

with an early ...c7-c5 and in accordance with Steinitz’s principles this means that White will not be disturbed when launching a dangerous attack on the kingside. Therefore Lasker duly played:




19 h4!

.




White has three ideas in mind. He wants to play h4-h5 at the right moment and place his queen on a dark square, exchange the dark-squared bishops and then advance his pawn to h6 and if possible the queen to f6. A second possibility is to exchange on g6 and exploit the g5-square and the h-file. A third possibility is to prepare a sacrifice on g6 which will have been weakened after the pawn exchange.

17...h5!




Black plans to profit from the advance h2-h3 by weakening White’s kingside further with ...h5-h4 and ...hxg3. White cannot really avoid this by playing the g3-pawn to g4, because Black can reply ...g7-g5 and ...

♘

g6-f4 with a positional advantage. This kind of kingside attack is exceptionally dangerous, since all pieces can be deployed in the attack as there have not yet been any exchanges.

Zaragatski – Kovalev

Lasker follows the well-known principle that when the attacker has a superiority in the centre the game can be decided with an attack on the flank. Another plan suggested by 

Komodo 11

 was the advance 42...h5 followed by ...h5-h4. In such a situation White must be careful of both ...h4-h3 and ...hxg3, weakening the kingside. Lasker’s move is more logical and human since it obtains strong pressure against f4.

Fischer – Miagmasuren

Sousse 1967

White to move







Fischer spent most time (15 minutes) during the whole game on the apparently harmless move 

13 a3

. He obviously wanted to prevent ...a4-a3 which would have forced White to play b2-b3 with resulting weaknesses on c3 and d4. The drawback of the move is that White loses a tempo in advancing his attack on the kingside. The revolutionary idea is that it went against established theory since the time of Steinitz and the 1951 World Championship match that you shouldn’t weaken yourself on the same side where you were being attacked.




13...bxa3 14 bxa3

Note that White doesn’t aim for h5-h6 in this position since he wants to keep these squares available (empty squares) for moves such as

Petrosian now had a free hand on the kingside and won one of his most beautiful games ever. A slightly more complex example of the same idea can be seen in the next position.

Agdestein – Olafsson

Nordic Championship 1985

Black to move







14...g6!




This move is reminiscent of ...a6 which was played in the previous example. In that game Petrosian prevented the opening of lines on the queenside and here Black does the same, but on the kingside. Black plans ...

148-150:

 Psychological and Pragmatic moves




We now turn to a very interesting part of the book where we touch on the human aspect of chess and how we can deal with different situations, both as a defender (148) and as an attacker (149-150).




Psychological chess has many dimensions and you will have some comments now and then about these issues when discussing other positions. In this section we are focusing on pragmatism and how it can affect the play psychologically.







148







Averbakh – Spassky

USSR Championship 1956

Black to move







16...

♘

c6!?




Brilliant ideas and a large dose of originality was Spassky’s signum. This move is regarded as one of the most incredible moves ever played. Presumably Spassky reasoned like this: Black has a very cramped position without any counterplay. Normal moves fail to improve his position and he would then have been slowly squeezed to death and the game decided on the h-file. Positionally he’s already lost so what to do? The only way is to be optimistic and play psychologically.




After 

17 dxc6 bxc6

 he has a semi-open b-file and the possibility of getting a knight on d4 after the manoeuvre ...

♘

e6-d4. Spassky’s idea was so strange that the audience thought that something was wrong with the demonstration board. What is even more incredible is that the great technician Averbakh failed to exploit his material advantage and the game ended in a draw after 73 moves.




If you are a professional player I recommend you play through the rest of the game in your head without a board and answer the question why the end position is a draw. The rest of you can do the same but with a board.




The rest of the moves were:

Karpov – Spassky

Game 3, Candidates match 1974

White to move







Spassky has just played the surprising move 29...

♘

e7-f5!. It bears a strong resemblance to 16...

♘

c6!? as in the previous game, but the difference is that this time, putting psychology aside, it is the best move. As in the game against Averbakh his thought must have been that he cannot play normal positional moves because then he will surely suffer defeat because he is positionally lost. So the only thing he can do is to confuse Karpov and bring the game into a tactical domain where it’s easier to make mistakes in calculation.




The question now is whether Karpov should accept the sacrifice or ignore it and pretend that nothing has happened?




Karpov played 

30 

♗

xg5!

.




Karpov thought for only four minutes before he decided on not only the safest but also the best move. Gunnar Johansson mentions in his book 

Schackgeniet Anatolij Karpov

 that it’s possible White wins if the sacrifice is accepted: 30 exf5 e4 31 

♗

d2 exf3+ 32 

♗

xf3 gxf5. I have checked this with 

Komodo 11

 and certainly it’s a win, for example after 33

In accordance with his style Karpov chose to play the pragmatic 

♗

xg5 on move 30, which also happened to be the best move. Here one could also consider Nimzowitsch’s statement that if you can choose between a complicated continuation which might lead to an advantage and a safe positional continuation which will lead to an advantage, then you should always choose the latter.




We will end our section about openings and middlegames by looking at one more recent example where pragmatism is adopted as an overall strategy.

Giri – Anand

Stavanger 2017

White to move




12 a4!?




Giri writes in his comments in 

New in Chess Magazine

 (5/2017) that he had several options and also considered 12 d4, 12 d3 and 12 h3. He thought that these three moves were too compromising and thus preferred the text move so he could see how Anand would react in reply. At the same time he could gain some time on the clock since most likely Anand wouldn’t have prepared for this move in his previous calculations.




12...b6 13 d3

Black had so many troubles that Anand had to resign after 33 moves. The bishop pair was simply too strong.




What’s interesting here is how pragmatic Giri behaved in this phase of the game. Especially moves 12, 17 and 20 showed that it’s not necessarily all about the best move but rather the 

practically

 best move.




Let’s move on to the second section of the book and concentrate on the final phase of the game, the endgame!

Part 2:




150 most important positions in the Endgame




151-167: Pawn Endings




Pawn endings are the foundation of all endings and a mastery of these is mandatory. One of the first things to learn is the opposition, especially the 

distant opposition

. We will describe this idea with a few simple examples to be sure it is fully mastered in all its different aspects.




Another important theme is 

triangulation

 which also touches on the subject of 

corresponding squares.




The next theme is 

the square

 but in an advanced form. It also touches on the interesting area of 

illusions

 in chess.




We will end the section on pawn endings by explaining how to play in positions with 

one extra pawn on the wing

 and a 

pawn majority

.

Gligorić – Fischer

Candidates Tournament, 1959

Black to move







57...

♔

b8!




After this move, keeping the distant opposition, the players agreed to a 

draw

. The white king cannot go to b4 and claim the opposition since the pawn stands in its way.




57...

♔

b7? obviously loses to 58

b5! as well as 57...

♔

c5! 

♔

♔

Grigoriev

Shakhmatny Listok 1931

The only way to hold the draw is by means of the opposition. When the black king captures the white pawn White’s king must be on b4. This is how it should be done:

Black wants to capture the pawn while shouldering the king.

Fahrni – Alapin

Das Endspiel im Schach

(Leipzig 1917)

White to move







This so-called Fahrni endgame probably took place in Munich some time between 1909-1917 but there is no evidence of this. The only thing we know for sure is that Fahrni published this ending on page 15 in his endgame book. This position has arisen in many games, for example Fiebig – Tartakower, Barmen 1905, 

where Tartakower was lucky because Fiebig failed to win.




The trick to win is to reach this position with Black to move. The only way to achieve this is by triangulation. You can play the king either to the squares d5-d4-c4 or d5-c4-d4 and in both cases the three squares are in the shape of a triangle. If Black’s king is placed on c7 as in the diagram, White wants to place the king on the corresponding square c5 and then break through to b6 next move and pick up the a6-pawn.




The main theme of this position is not only to show the trick how to lose a tempo but also to introduce a simpler form of corresponding squares. The d5-square corresponds to the c8-square and the c4-square to the c8-square and that means that the player who is to move is at a disadvantage.

So don’t forget this important triangulation manoeuvre. The young Kasparov didn’t miss it when he played Alburt in Daugavpils, 1978, but Alburt was “impolite” and resigned one move too early, not allowing Kasparov to complete the triangulation.




Triangulation is a more common device than one might believe. The idea of losing a move and placing the opponent in a zugzwang situation can be found in other endings as well, for example in the ending queen against rook, 

position 284

.




The concept of corresponding squares is of immense importance and we’ll touch on it again in the two following positions, as well as in the section 

Bishop Endings,

 

position 189

.







156







Moravec

 1940

White to move







Black’s d5-pawn is doomed but White must capture it in the right way.




Correct is 

1 

♔

b4!




1 

♔

c3? 

♔

g5 2 

♔

d4 

♔

f4 leads to a draw as White is forced to make a move. Compare this with the main variation where the same position arises but with Black to move.




1...

♔

g5 2 

♔

c5 

♔

f4 3 

♔

d4

!




The d4-square corresponds to the f4-square and White wins due to zugzwang. Of course not 3 

♔

xd5? 

♔

e3 and Black captures the pawn.




After the further 

3...

♔

g3 4 

♔

xd5 

♔

f2 5 e4

 the e-pawn moves two squares in one move.




Note that the position is a draw if we move all the pieces up one square. The reason is that White can then only move the pawn one square since it stands on e3 while the black king on f3 is ready to capture it.







157







Lasker

 1900

White to move







This position is a more advanced form of corresponding squares. White can break through via c4 to b5 or via h4 to g5 or h5. The key position is when the king is on d3. For White to win, the black king must be on c7 with White to move.




The solution is 

1 

♔

b2!

.

It’s important to grasp this study so go through it carefully until you understand it 100 percent. If you understand this position you will understand other positions where corresponding squares are involved. Why not look at 

position 197

 which also touches on the same theme?







158







Réti

 1921

White to move







Why is this pawn ending important? You will never reach this position in a game but it’s the ideas it represents that are important. The position is a very instructive and pure example showing how to play with multiple plans or double threats with every move. White has two goals. He wants either to support his pawn or catch the enemy pawn. On the surface it looks impossible but the geometry of chess can sometimes fool you.

♔

g7!




By placing the king on this square White is following two paths at the same time and accordingly has two plans in mind.

2...h3 doesn’t win on account of 3

3 

♔

e5!!




The double threat of 4 

♔

d6, supporting the c6-pawn, and 4 

♔

f4, trapping the enemy pawn, secures half a point.




The endgame expert Averbakh used this position as an example in 

Chess Tactics for Advanced Chess Players

 to explain that the double threat is the heart of all tactics and combinations.

Moravec

Československý Šach 1952

White to move







This position is illusory since the white king is outside the square of the enemy pawn. Nevertheless it’s still a draw.




White approaches both pawns by playing 

1 

♔

Black replies 

1...h5

.




Of course if 1...

♔

c7 White gains the necessary tempo to reach the square h5-h1-d1-d5 after 2 

♔

c4 h5 3 

♔

d5.







2 

♔

c6!!




White sets up a double threat and achieves the draw. This move mimics 3 

♔

e5!! in the previous study by Réti but the beautiful point is that in Moravec’s study the king is placed in front of the pawn, setting up the necessary double threat of 

♔

Réti

White to move







It’s unbelievably magical that this position is a draw, despite the fact that White is two pawns down, although thanks to 

position 158

 it’s easier to understand that the miracle of Dunkirk is indeed achievable.

Don’t forget illusions and miracles in chess! The great chess teacher GM Luděk Pachman once said that there are no miracles in chess and to a certain extent he’s right, but nevertheless we have to be prepared for the extraordinary when it occurs, 

whether we solve studies or play a game. It’s sometimes possible to run through a wall and we have to understand when that is indeed a reality – since magic sometimes interweaves with real life.

Schlechter – Marco

1893

White to move







On the surface the a-pawn looks doomed whereas the black d-pawn will eventually queen. However, this is a famous illusion which has been seen many times in practical games and studies.




It’s said that the famous study by Réti from 1921, 

position 158

, was inspired by this position which appeared in 1893 in 

Deutsches Wochenschach

.




The game was agreed drawn after 

57 a4 

♔

b4 58 

♔

b6!

 since the white king will support the pawn if a4-a5 follows, while 

58...

. This is the idea in its simplest form and the key idea to remember when dealing with more advanced examples.

2...

♔

c4 seems to lead to the same situation we saw in Schlechter – Marco, where Black is threatening to enter the square of the a-pawn while threatening to support his own pawn. However, White wins after 3 a6

g2

Black to move







The golden principle to hold the draw a pawn down in this type of position is to be as active as possible with the king and then advance the h-pawn to secure a profitable exchange.




1...

♔

f4




The principled move, although other king moves on the f- and g-file hold as well. The main thing for Black is to prevent the opponent’s king from reaching h6 and in this position this goal will be achieved if the white king reaches h4 or g4.




1...

xf6+ exf6 but on the kingside. In both variations Black must be careful not to allow the exchange of all the pieces as this will lead to a lost pawn ending.




The excellent variations by Euwe show how to win most convincingly. White has four healthy pawns versus Black’s three on the kingside, while Black has four against three on the queenside. However, the problem for Black is that his c-pawns are doubled and with correct defensive play by White on the queenside it’s impossible to create a passed pawn. Let’s see how this strategy is outlined by Euwe.

d2




The first step for both players is to activate their kings.

The second step involves a combination of activating the pawn majority as well as halting the opponent’s majority as early as he can.

White stops any further advance of the c-pawn at once, thereby preventing Black from gaining time and space.




4...c6 5 a4

Of course White keeps his pawns intact on the queenside.

Before we end this section on pawn endings and move on to knight endings we must not forget the most incredible pawn ending I’ve ever seen. I discovered it with delight many years ago when I studied pawn endings in Reuben Fine’s 

Basic Chess Endings.

Berger – Bauer

Correspondence 1889-1891

White to move







Sometimes it’s possible to win even though the pawn majority is 

crippled. This instructive position arose in a correspondence game a long time ago. If White wants to win he must participate in a hair raising pawn race since that’s the only way to win. Exact calculation is required and in over the board play it wouldn’t be so easy to find the ingenious win achieved by Berger.

 and White wins handsomely by following up with the deadly

The advantage with promoting a rook pawn is that it automatically controls the opponent’s corner on the long diagonal so never underestimate the cheapest material on the board, since it can suddenly turn out to be the most valuable piece on the board!




168-180: Knight Endings




Knight endings have some similarities to pawn endings which is useful to keep in mind whenever we play or study a knight endgame. The same type of advantage that often proves decisive in pawn endings is often decisive in knight endings, whether it’s an outside passed pawn or the exploitation of four pawns against three on the same side.

Grigoriev

 1932

White to move







One of the worst enemies for the knight is the rook pawn (and the 

second worst is the knight pawn) but in some positions the knight can turn out to be a magical piece indeed.




In the study by the great study composer Grigoriev White saves the game after:

Jaenisch

 1837

White or Black to move







Normally the possessor of one or several pawns can play for a win unless there is a rook pawn involved and the king is in front of it. In such a situation it is worthwhile for the king and knight to find out if it’s possible to organise the pieces in such a way as to checkmate the king in the corner. In this study by Jaenisch White wins whether it’s his turn to move or not. This is how to do it: First the king goes to f1 while Black advances his pawns.

Laroche – Greville

Paris 1848

White to move







This endgame was played at the famous Café de la Régence in its heyday before it moved to Hôtel Dodun in 1852. Kieseritzky remarked that the ending was very interesting. I can only agree since I’m very well acquainted with this endgame after having played several training games from exactly the same starting position, more than 20 years ago.




The trick to hold the draw is fairly simple. Black should place his king in the middle area of White’s pawns, that is the g6-square, and when one of the pawns is pushed to the fifth rank Black will blockade it with the king. It’s of immense importance not to allow all the pawns to reach the fifth rank. A knight is worth three pawns only if these are located on the fourth rank. Placed on the fifth rank they outsmart the knight.

White to move wins in the diagram above after 1 f5+!. The rule given by Averbakh/Chekhover states that “three connected pawns defeat a knight if they all reach the fifth rank.” But, as we’ll discuss later, it’s important that the pawns are well supported by the king because otherwise the knight can destroy the nice pawn phalanx on the fifth rank by threatening one of the pawns that cannot be protected by the king.

Hillarp Persson – Dragnev

Stockholm 2018

White to move







In this position the Swedish grandmaster Tiger Hillarp Persson played what was to my eyes the amazing move 

54 

♔

g5!!

.




I was surprised because I was sure he was going to play 54 f5, which is actually a mistake. Let me explain. I grew up with the endgame books by Fine and Averbakh so when I saw this position during a visit to the Rilton Cup, on the first day of 2018, I was staggered Tiger didn’t play 54 f5 since, according to Fine’s rule in 

Basic Chess Endings

, this endgame is won if two pawns reach the fifth rank. Later in the 70s this rule was altered by Averbakh and Chekhover. Their new rule stated that all pawns must be placed on the fifth rank to secure a win.




If we apply this rule in the present position it’s actually a draw. Let’s try 54 f5?. Black activates the knight either with 54...

♘

f2! or 54...

♘

b2! and holds the draw even when all pawns are placed on the fifth rank after 55 g5. What is going on? Black attacks the e5-pawn with 55...

♘

♘

♘

♔

♘

xe6. This is the most illuminating variation showing why the position is a draw.




The reason White was unable to win, despite the fact that all the pawns were located on the fifth rank, was that Black could force one of the pawns to the sixth rank and in this case it secured the draw. Averbakh/Chekhover were not completely correct in stipulating that “three connected pawns defeat a knight if they all reach the fifth rank” since it’s vital that the defender cannot disrupt the horizontal formation of the pawns on 

the fifth rank, which actually is the case here.




The necessary and simplest supplement to Averbakh’s/Chekhov’s rule is to reformulate it by stating that “three connected pawns on the fifth rank win against a knight if they are supported by the king.”

Halberstadt

White to move







Superficially this position looks like a dead draw. After all, Black’s knight on f8 stands in front of the passed pawn and the king is protecting the knight. So, we have another illusion. Chess is full of them and we must learn them one by one!

If Keres failed to win with a passed pawn then the next ending should be even more difficult to win. There is only one way to acquire the 

necessary confidence when playing such endings and that is by testing them against a friend or a computer, both as an attacker and defender. Only then will you gain a good understanding of knight endings.







176







Gebhardt – Bellman

Levelezés 1996

Black to move







Black has good practical chances of exploiting the extra pawn in a situation where there are four pawns versus three on the same side of the board. However, it’s not easy to defeat a computer. In his famous 

Basic Chess Endings

 (the main endgame book before Averbakh, Dvoretsky, Nunn, Müller and Tablebase entered the arena) Fine believes that this endgame is probably won. Dvoretsky thinks Fine is right as he wrote in 

Dvoretsky’s Endgame Manual.




The defender, which in this case is White, has three main defences:




a) The first defence is to play passively and wait while Black activates his pieces and pawns. This plan is not to be recommended as it’s too risky.




b) The second defence is to play actively with the f-pawn. If Black already has his pawn on e5 White can try to exchange it by preparing f2-f4.




c) The third defensive idea is to mobilise the g-pawn.




It seems best to opt for the second defence and go on the offensive with the f-pawn and this is also the plan recommended by Fine/Dvoretsky.




In the game Black played

 which for the moment prevents White from centralising his king. If 31...e5 32

32 f4!







White has completed the most effective arrangement of his kingside pawns by creating a wave. When playing a pawn down, four versus three on the same side, this is the most resistent set-up for the defender. Compare this with a rook ending where the most desirable formation is an opposite wave consisting of pawns located on f2, g3 and h4. Such waves are easy to remember if you know of their existence and above all understand their effectiveness!

♔

f7 33

33...g5?




Normally Black wants to avoid pawn exchanges because then the drawing chances would increase dramatically for White. The main purpose of the move played is to obtain a passer on the e-file if White exchanges pawns on g5. Note that the same result will arise if Black prepares the ...e6-e5 push. However, the problem is that when Black’s pieces are not sufficiently active it will be easy for White to set up a blockade and stop the pawn from reaching e4.




The normal continuation would be the activation of the kings. After 33...

The main rule to keep in mind for the defender is to conduct an active defence (32 f4!) and exchange as many pawns as possible (41 h4!).




An additional resource for the attacker, because of his extra pawn, is that in some positions it’s possible to sacrifice the knight for two pawns. This means that the attacker plays with three pawns versus a knight which in some cases, as we already have mentioned, means a win. This is an idea to bear in mind for both the attacker and the defender! Good luck whenever you reach this fascinating but unfortunately rare ending.

Lasker – Nimzowitsch

Zürich 1934

Black to move







This position illustrates the advantage of having a distant passed pawn. It’s also a typical example for understanding the meaning of Botvinnik’s statement that knight endings are like pawn endings. However, in knight endings there are more defensive resources available. This classic example is the most famous one on the particular theme of distant passed pawn, but another, less instructive, endgame is Chigorin – Marshall, Carlsbad 1907.

181-191: Bishop Endings




Bishop endings are frequently a matter of finding the right diagonals. What is characteristic though is the bishop’s inability (and ability!) to work on half the board, which is a consequence of the bishop pair being split. This inability is most clearly seen when the attacker has a bishop of opposite colour to the corner square where a rook pawn aims to be promoted against a blockading king. The balance between the bishops is most upset when bishops of opposite colour are on the board. Such endings obviously have their own rules.

Centurini

 1847

White to move







It’s normally easier to win with a bishop pawn or a knight pawn rather than with a central pawn. The reason for this is that the diagonals are shorter on the side of the board. According to Centurini’s rule one needs at least two available squares for the bishop to be able to hold the draw. In this example the a7-b8 diagonal is too short.




1 

♗

h4




White’s main idea is to manoeuvre the bishop to b8 and force the black bishop away from the h2-b8 diagonal.




1...

Black must prevent the bishop from reaching a7. If Black plays passively with, for example, 1...

Averbakh

 1977

White to move







There are four cases which have been analysed in depth by Centurini and Averbakh. The basic winning position, which is the 

First Case

, is a situation where the defender cannot control the squares in front of the pawn. Positions where the defender stands close to the pawn but not in front of it makes it easier for the attacker to exchange bishops. In this position White wins by exchanging bishops either on c6 or d7.




White wins after

Kurajica – Markland

Hastings 1971/72

Black to move







The main question to answer when facing this type of ending is whether the defending king should manoeuvre behind the pawn or in front of it. The first method is called the 

Second Case

 and the second method the 

Fourth Case.

 The 

Third Case

 by the way means that the defending king is behind the pawn but one of the diagonals is less than four squares long.




In the game

However, the safest defence is to go behind the pawn rather than to place the king in front of it, unless it can reach the f7-square by force. After 1...

Capablanca – Janowski

New York 1916

Black to move







Here is the most famous position with this particular distribution of material. What is incredible is that the same position arose in another high level game between Taimanov and Fischer at Buenos Aires in 1960. The only slight difference was that Black’s king was placed on f4 with White to move.




Capablanca played

60 e5! Black resigned

 since it’s not possible to prevent the decisive f4-f5 after which the e-pawn decides.




An instructive example which shows that both players had problems realising not only the value but also the right moment when to place a pawn on the same colour as the bishop. Black had several chances to play ...g5 until White played his pawn to f4.







188







Wojtkiewicz – Khalifman

Rakvere 1993

White to move







Capablanca formulated the famous and important rule “When the opponent has a bishop, keep your pawns on squares on the same colour as this bishop. But if you have the bishop, then irrespective of whether or not the opponent has a bishop, 

keep your pawns on squares of the opposite colour to that of your bishop.” However, there are exceptions to Capablanca’s rule.




It’s correct to place the pawns on the same colour as the opponent’s bishop if it’s not possible to attack them. In this position it’s important to fix Black’s queenside, thereby making it a future target for the white pieces, so Wojtkiewicz’s move 

30 a4!

 makes a lot of sense.




Note that the routine move 30

30...g5 31

Averbakh

 1954

White to move







If in the previous example the attacker exploited his positional advantage by placing his pawns on the same colour as the bishop and going against the famous rule by Capablanca, then in contrast this study by Averbakh follows the rule by Capablanca that states: “If you have a bishop, then, irrespective or whether or not the opponent has a bishop, keep your pawns on squares of the opposite colour to that of your bishop.”




I have been familiar with this study ever since I was a teenager and the reason was that my friend Peter Fransson showed it to me several times and was fascinated by it. In fact he was so fascinated that he specialised in this type of bishop ending and produced instructive material on it.




Averbakh has written that virtually all bishop endings depend on the availability of invasion squares. In this position Black’s king guards against an invasion by the white king, so the question is how can White cede the move to Black. Obviously the f3-square corresponds to the f7-square so the trick is to lure Black, who has less space on the diagonals, to lose a move.




Averbakh’s solution runs as follows:

Vaganian – Karpov

Leningrad 1969

White to move







One of the leading principles to play for a win in endings with bishops of opposite colour is to create two passed pawns. In this position the main question to answer is whether this is possible.




Karpov, who is famous for his skill in handling bishops of opposite colour positions, played

The e-pawn in itself is not worth anything. More important is the space it vacates for the king.

192-205: Knight and Bishop Endings




The short-range knight versus the long-range bishop introduces among other things the theme of domination, where the bishop sometimes dominates the knight or the other way around. However, what is striking is that in this particular ending the pawn position is almost decisive in determining which of the two pieces is the strongest.




Apart from these features we’ll also look at different methods how to mate with knight and bishop versus a lone king. The section ends with some positions where the bishop pair show their endgame talents against knight(s).

White to move







The knight is a peculiar piece since it is unable to gain a tempo so it’s impossible for White to force Black to move. To understand this position it’s simplest to think that the knight controls different coloured squares on each move and that’s the reason this position is a draw.




When the knight and the defender’s king are placed on the same colour it’s a draw if the attacker is to move. Here White can exploit the fact that the knight can never gain a tempo by placing the king on the same colour as the knight.

I still remember that right after the game IM Konstanty Kaiszauri told me I had missed a theoretical draw. This episode provides some proof that this position was one of the important positions in Kaiszauri’s head, since he knew the correct evaluation of it way ahead the Tablebase we have available online today.




According to 

Encyclopaedia of Chess Endings – Minor Piece Endings

 I’m not the only victim in this ending. Mikhalchisin lost to Anikaev in the USSR 1981 and Helgi Olafsson lost to Ivanchuk at Reykjavik 1990. Such defeats in theoretically drawn endings just go to show that this ending is tricky in practice. However, the first thing you have to know is that the position is a draw and I didn’t in 1980.




Note that this ending is a draw even if the pawns are placed further back. However, this is a rare ending, a once in a lifetime event, and it really impressed me that Kaiszauri had this knowledge, unlike me. However, I now understood how important it was to acquire this knowledge since I had just lost a drawn endgame.

Flohr – Capablanca

Moscow 1935

Black to move







In this endgame White has a slight advantage but Black should be able to hold if he places his pawns on b6 and a5 according to Capablanca’s rule.

d6 25 

♔

White’s king belongs on d4 and so the knight manoeuvres to a square from where it can exert pressure on the isolated pawn.




27...f6! 28

Capablanca has followed his own advice and placed pawns on the opposite colour of his bishop.

♘

b1 

♗

e6 31 

♘

c3 

♔

c6 32 a3 h6 33 g3







33...h5!




Capablanca now breaks his own rule – because he does not want to allow his opponent a free hand on the kingside. If Black remains completely passive White can considerably improve his position by playing his knight to h4 followed by f4-f5 and g3-g4 and then manoeuvre the knight to e6 via g2 and f4 and win when the king is placed on c6. White’s h-pawn can help to set up such a zugzwang. Of course Black’s bishop has options of disturbing the manoeuvring ability of the knight while his h-pawn can help to prevent future expansion with g3-g4. It’s not at all easy for White to get at the pawn on h5 and so it should be okay to place it there.




Another continuation was to follow Capablanca’s advice and let the h-pawn stay on h6 and instead play 33...

♔

d6!? and keep active with his bishop after 34

d1 (Continuations like 34 f5

♗

g4 35 

♘

f2

e2! with excellent drawing chances. If White places his kingside pawns on white 

squares they will be targets for the bishop to attack from the rear.




So there are actually two defensive strategies to adopt in this type of ending. It’s good to know that there is room for several strategies, since it means the margins for holding the draw are pretty good. If the diagram position is the worst you can get when playing with an isolani, it means it’s still acceptable.

Kudrin – Gulko

USA Championship 1988

White to move







In his excellent book 

Winning Pawn Structures – The Isolated Queen’s Pawn and its Derivatives

 GM Alexander Baburin thinks that, compared with the previous example, White’s pawn formation is somewhat better. One reason is that it’s more difficult for Black to play ...a7-a5 because of White’s possibility of responding b2-b4. If White captures on b4 White recaptures with the c-pawn, thereby obtaining a pawn 

majority with chances of later establishing an outside passed pawn.




31 a3




A good rule to follow is to place all pieces on the opposite colour of the enemy bishop.

Baburin thinks that one possible plan for White is to advance the f-pawn to f5 followed by 

♘

f4 with a grip on the kingside. This explains Black’s reaction in the game. However, another idea might be the long-term plan b4-b5 followed by the knight manoeuvre

35...g5




This is Black’s best set-up on the kingside.




36 g3

A more direct approach was Baburin’s recommendation 37 f4 gxh4 38 gxh4 followed by a knight manoeuvre to e3 where it can head for one of the three squares d5, f5 or g4. Black has three weaknesses in the centre and on the kingside, while a7 might be a fourth weakness.

If White should be able to win this position it’s not enough to do so with the weakness on d5. White needs to create another weakness and this has now been accomplished. White has exploited the fact that Black didn’t move his a-pawn and it’s now fixed 

on a7. There it’s a potential target which can be attacked by the white knight on the outpost c6.

It’s very interesting and kind of magical that there is such a big difference having a pawn on e3 and c3. This knowledge can of course be exploited by striving for this pawn structure and starting to exchange the right pieces. The knowledge of important positions like this one automatically gives sustenance for winning formulae.

And now the f6-pawn is attacked. Note that so far the knight has attacked pawns on dark-coloured squares but after Black’s next move the attack will shift to light ones. This is the main reason the knight is 

actually better than the bishop when hunting pawns, since the bishop is limited to one specific colour.

Stoltz – Kashdan

Olympiad, The Hague 1928

Black to move







This position is a classical example of how to play in an open position with a bishop versus a knight. The first question to ask is whether the knight dominates the bishop or is it the bishop that dominates the knight? Other important issues in this position concern who has the most active king and the better pawn structure. When the owner of the bishop has the more active king it can prove decisive when there is a distribution of pawns on both sides of the board. However, this particular position should end in a draw with correct play.




First the players activate their kings.

Capablanca

A Primer of Chess 1935

White to move







I’ve heard stories about 2200-players who failed to win this ending. It will probably happen once or twice in your life that you have to play this ending as an attacker or as a defender. However, the most important thing is not the ending in itself. It’s just the means to learn the method how to coordinate king, knight and bishop and develop a deeper feeling for the pieces’ abilities. I used to teach children this endgame at a very early stage and they should know how to do it before they reach an Elo rating of 1500 to get a good feeling for how knight and bishop can harmonise together like a bishop pair.




There are three different methods to checkmate the lone king and we’ll look at each of them in turn. All three methods must have the objective of systematically driving the opponent’s king into the corner of the board that is of the same colour as the bishop.




Capablanca’s method was the first I learned as a junior and it involves bringing up all the pieces to drive the king down the board. This is how to do it:

♔

c6 6 

♔

c4 would have accomplished the second step which is to drive the king away from the large centre f3-c3-c6-f6.







6 

♔

d4




The third step is to drive the king to the last rank.




6...

♔

a5




The defender should head for one of the light-squared corners. 6...

This is the main set-up to learn by heart because it will be repeated according to a pattern involving a V-manoeuvre with the knight as well as with the bishop, while the king stands in opposition.

The above mentioned method inspired by Capablanca’s 

A Primer of Chess

 is my preferred procedure when teaching this ending, because it’s the easiest to learn by heart.




There are two other methods which are good to know about since it will increase your ability to play with knight and bishop in all kinds of situations on the board.




If the first method could be baptised Capablanca’s method, meaning that the activation of the king is the first thing to do, then the second method could be called Euwe’s or Karpov’s method. In his endgame book Euwe presents a method where the knight is placed on one of the central squares and then defended by a bishop from a distance, for example a fianchettoed bishop on g2 defends a knight on d5. The advantage of this set-up is that wherever the king will try to escape, the knight will be in the right position. The reason Karpov is named in this method is that, contrary to Capablanca, he realised that in endgames piece centralisation is often more important than king centralisation. Of course in this ending it’s just a matter of taste.




Now, when you are aware of the second method where centralisation of the pieces goes before the centralisation of the king, we go to what is probably the most difficult method which effectively features the Pythagorus theorem of the hypotenuse.

Chéron

Lehr-und Handbuch der Endspiele

Band 2 1964

White to move







If we think of the b1-h7 diagonal as the hypotenuse of a triangle, White’s mission is to make the triangle smaller and smaller by changing diagonals from b1-h7 to d1-h5 and eventually from d1-h5 to f1-h3 when mate comes quickly. Chéron presents the following variation:

In this variation the king was mated on a black square next to the corner. However, if instead 19...

♔

h1 the king would have been mated in three moves by the bishop in the corner square itself.




It’s definitely worthwhile to learn the hypotenuse method but it demands precise play with the king.




My recommendation is that you learn all three methods and then choose the most appropriate one depending on the position.

Black to move







According to Mega Database 2018 this endgame has only arisen 118 times out of 7,187,893 games so it is extremely rare. Luckily it has arisen in a World Championship game. That two bishops always win against a knight was one of the important discoveries made by Tablebase. Black can decide the game either by winning the knight or by playing for mate.




This position arose in the seventeenth game in the World Championship match between Botvinnik – Tal in 1961. Tablebase informs us that it’s mate in 23 moves and Tal won quickly after

This is a useful ending to practice with the computer. You play with the bishop pair and try to beat the computer. You will learn a lot about how to play with the bishop pair and the technique you learn can be used in other and completely different positions where the bishop pair is involved. It’s about learning bishop pair technique!




GM Glenn Flear has written an excellent book 

Practical Endgame Play – Beyond the basics – the definitive guide to the endgames that really matter

 and it’s one of the few books available focusing on the very important endgames where you have more than one piece each but with a maximum of two. Flear has a name for such endings and calls them ‘NQE’ – for ‘Not Quite an Endgame’ (pronounced ‘nuckie’).




According to his statistics 15-20 % of all games reach the following type of ending. This means that if you are seriously studying such endings you will have a substantial advantage over players who haven’t incorporated such study in their habit of chess training.

Flohr – Botvinnik

Match 1933

White to move







According to Botvinnik this endgame should end in a draw although White can expect some practical winning chances on a scale of 60 to 40. White has more space as well as a pair of bishops against a pair of knights.




The main drawback of the two knights is that it will be harder to exchange one of the bishops but Black should be able to draw with active play. There are two other things going for Black. Firstly, the position is locked. In an open position the bishop pair would have been a decisive factor with pawns on both sides of the board. Secondly the pawn position is symmetrical. White has no passed pawn(s) and for the moment no quantitative pawn majority when the bishop pair might be a crushing factor.




The game continued:

A very instructive endgame showing the difficulties the defending knights had to contend with after passive play. Note that Flohr avoided variations where one of the bishops might have been exchanged since that would have reduced his winning chances. His main strategy was to keep the bishops away from the knights and exploit his space advantage for decisive breaks. Every pawn exchange made the position more and more open, resulting in two overpowering bishops.




This endgame illuminated what Tarrasch once said: “The future belongs to he who has the bishops.”




206-277: Rook Endings




Rook endings demand the most knowledge and therefore quite a lot of positions are presented since these occur in 50% of all endgames. Another reason is that sometimes the correct procedures in rook endings are almost of a mystical and unique nature. Even sensible moves can turn out to be mistakes, which is not usually the case in other endgames.




Another important piece of information is that rook endings can often be saved despite the fact that a player is one or even two pawns down. Holding the draw in difficult situations was actually one of Alekhine’s secrets. When you are in trouble you try to reach a rook ending a pawn down according to the old adage: “All rook endings are drawn”.

Surprisingly the natural move 1

Kopaev

Black to move







When the rook is facing two far advanced pawns it’s important that the king is close enough to enable it to save the draw. The best place for the rook in this study by the famous study composer Nikolay Kopaev is 

1...

It’s necessary to prevent White from playing 

♔

g7 followed by the march of the f-pawn. If you are not familiar with this type of position your instinct might fail you and the mistake 1...

Kamsky – Bacrot

Sofia 2006

Black to move







This ending often arises from the ending rook versus pawn. This is what happened in the game. Black was unable to queen the e-pawn due to mate and promoted to a knight with check.




White has just played 75

Vedder – Engqvist

Dvoretsky

 2003

White to move







Black has set up an impregnable fortress. It’s important to place the h-pawn on h5 before White gets the chance to place his g-pawn on g4. If Black has placed the pawn on h5 it doesn’t matter if White’s g-pawn is placed on g5.




Dvoretsky gives the following variations:




1 h4!?




When the pawn is on g3 White can try to manoeuvre the king to g5 but Black will stop that from happening by playing ...

Studenetsky

White to move







This position shows how strong the control of the absolute seventh rank can be. White to play wins after:




1 

♖

g8+ 

♔

d7 2 

♖

g7+ 

♔

e8




2...

♔

d6!




White threatens 

♖

h8+ so Black must react, but alas all moves are losing, for example 

4...

♖

d8+ 5 

♔

e6

.




Providing you don’t forget this position you’ll always think twice to see if there is any magic involved when controlling the seventh rank. This is something you should do whether it’s an endgame or a middlegame since the rook’s normal value has increased by quite a considerable extent.







221







Philidor

 1777

Black to move







Of all the endings you’ll play in your life approximately 50 per cent of them will be rook endings. But if you only know one important position then it should be the Philidor position!




Black to move draws with 

1...

♖

h6!




It’s important to cut off the enemy king so it’s unable to reach the sixth rank.




2 e5 

♖

g6




Black keeps his rook on the sixth rank until White advances his pawn there.




3 e6




White is threatening to penetrate decisively with the king, so Black must play offensively with the rook.




3...

♖

g1! 4 

♔

d6 

♖

This is the saving idea. White cannot hinder the checks from the rear and is unable to create any danger for the defender.




5 

♔

e5 

♖

e1+ 6 

♔

f6 

♖

It’s a draw since White cannot drive away the black king from either e8 or e7.




This is a simple and good illustration of Lasker’s saying that “He who can play with a rook can play chess.”

The second most important rook ending to know by heart is the Lucena position from the 15

 century.

Philidor

 1777

Black to move







Black threatens to win with 1 

♖

h8+ 

♔

d7 2 e6+ so Black must put pressure on the e-pawn at once.




1...

♖

e1! 2 

♔

e6




2 e6 is met by 2...

♖

f1+ in accordance with the previous Philidor’s position, while 2 

♖

h8+ is useless after 2...

♔

d7 since White cannot advance his e-pawn to e6. This is the main point of placing the rook on the e-file.







2...

♔

f8!




The rule is to step to the short side with the king and keep the long side for the rook. In this 

position 2

...

♔

d8 draws as well, since after 3 

♖

♔

c7 4 

♖

e8 

♖

h1 5 

♔

f7 

♖

♔

d7 the long side is long enough for the rook to make disturbing checks. However, when the stronger side has the bishop pawn it’s vital to step with the king to the short side of the pawn so the long side is available for timely annoying checks, otherwise the position is lost since it will transpose to a Lucena position.




3 

♖

h8+ 

♔

g7 4 

♖

e8




White threatens to play the king to d7 so this is the signal to transfer the rook to the long side and upset White’s plan of creating a Lucena position. After 4 

♖

a8 Black maintains the pressure on the f-pawn with 4...

♖

224







Vancura

 1924

White to move







The idea of using the long side for the rook is also the main method to draw this position by Vancura, which could be regarded as the third most important endgame after Philidor and Lucena.




After 

1 

♔

e5

 Black must maintain the pressure against the a6-pawn so White cannot liberate his rook. Any move along the sixth rank is suitable. When White approaches the enemy rook, Black goes back with the rook to f6 followed by checks along the f-file.




Play can go like this:




1...

♖

b6 2 

♔

d5 

♖

f6!




The simplest move. Black’s king is best placed on g7 or h7 and doesn’t need to be moved. Beware of the tactical trap 2...

The king is on its way to c5 so other routes were possible as well, for example 1

Black has enough space on the band a-files to force the white king back to b3. White cannot make any headway. Note that if the black rook had been placed on b7 this method wouldn’t have worked since the files would have been too short.

Grigoriev

If the opponent’s king is cut off by at least three files (the c-, d- and efiles), counting from the b4-pawn, it’s always a win. It doesn’t matter where on the f-file the king is placed.

Kasparov – Short

World Championship match,

Black to move







Rooks and two isolated pawns normally win by getting one pawn to the fifth rank and abandoning the other so that after its capture the defending king is cut off. In the ninth game of their World Championship match Short missed a draw against Kasparov.

Gligorić – Smyslov

Moscow 1947

White to move







The ending with rook pawn and bishop pawn occurs relatively often and is very important to master. Although it’s a theoretical draw the attacker wins from time to time. One of the most famous examples is the game Carlsen 

–

 Aronian, FIDE Knockout, Tripoli 2004, where Carlsen lost. This proves that this endgame can be tricky with only 30 seconds per move. This ending frequently leads to endings where the h-pawn is used as a decoy in attempts to queen the f-pawn.




In this famous rook ending between Gligorić and Smyslov the black rook works well on the rank by temporarily cutting off the king.




83 

♖

g6+




White wants the king to declare its intentions. 83 f5 blocks the strong rook on the fifth rank but after 85...

♖

b1! the rook will nevertheless be active behind the enemy king and pawns.




83...

♔

f7!




The basic rule for the king is that it should be placed on f7 until life becomes too dangerous and it runs the risk of being driven to the last rank. If that’s the case the king will be placed on g7. Later it can go to h6, blockading the h-pawn. 83...

♔

h7 doesn’t lose but makes the defence trickier.




84 

♖

g5




The black rook is annoying for the white king so White forces it to change direction.




84...

♖

b1!







This is an excellent square since, if necessary, the rook has possibilities of checking on the fifth rank as well as on the three files behind the white pieces.

Keres – Botvinnik

The Hague/Moscow 1948

White to move







When White is a pawn down the defender must play an active game with the remaining pieces, especially the rook. Here Black’s threat is to play ...

♖

c3+ and pick up the a-pawn so the question is to find the most accurate way of defending it.




Keres played 

50 a4

 which isn’t the principled continuation.




According to Botvinnik the active “50 

♖

a4 would not have guaranteed a certain draw after 50...

xh4 

♔

the further 54...

Another interesting alternative, not mentioned by Botvinnik, was 50 h4!?. If White somehow manages to eliminate all the pawns on the kingside he should have a certain draw. After 50...

51...

♔

“It was essential to retain the h6-pawn, defended by the rook; then the black king would have gained freedom of movement. With the pawn on g5 the king is tied down, and White can easily gain a draw.”




Botvinnik suggests 51...gxh4 but after 52

“White considers himself obliged to defend the third rank and he loses the game. Meanwhile 53

Alekhine – Capablanca

World Championship match,

Buenos Aires 1927

White to move







This famous position from the 34

th

 World Championship game between Alekhine and Capablanca is a text book demonstration of how to exploit an extra outside passed pawn in a rook ending where the stronger side’s rook is behind the passed pawn.




Alekhine played 

54 

♖

a4!




This move is the first step in a six-stage-plan to win this position. By positioning the rook behind the passed pawn Black is forced to place his rook in front of the pawn thereby reducing it it too passivity. 54 

♖

d5 is possible and in fact Alekhine played it on move 52 although it’s not the strongest location for the rook. Tarrasch once said that the rooks belong behind passed pawns, whether they be attackers or defenders, and his statement is certainly applicable to this position.

The second step is to move the king towards the centre.

Black is in zugzwang and forced to move a pawn on the kingside, despite the fact that it will be easier for White to attack on that flank in the future. Black cannot move the rook since 58...

Rubinstein – Lasker

Saint Petersburg 1909

30 h4!




White seizes space on the kingside before advancing with the passed pawn. This also represents a defence against a future ...

Duras – Capablanca

New York 1913

Black to move







Capablanca played 

38...h5

 but more precise was 38...g5! which prevents White from exchanging his h-pawn. Black then increases his chances of advancing down the board. Note that the black rook is excellently placed on White’s fourth rank. If not, White to move would have played 38 h4! followed by g2-g3 setting up the most resistant pawn formation when playing with three pawns against four. The pawn wave f2-g3-h4 is a very effective defensive formation in other endings as well, apart from knight endings where the formation h2-g3-f4 is more advantageous.




39 g3!




It’s necessary to stop Black from playing his pawn to h4, fixing the g2-pawn.




39...h4




It’s too early for 39...g5 due to 40 

♖

a5 f6 41 

♖

a7! and the king is cut off on the last rank.







40 gxh4?




Correct was 40 g4 with the aim of exchanging the g-pawn for the stronger f-pawn. The weak square on f4 isn’t so serious and White will pressurise the weakest pawn in Black’s position to make it more difficult for Black to activate his king.

Duras – Nimzowitsch

San Sebastian 1912

Black to move







The reason we are discussing this complicated endgame again is that when we looked at Duras – Capablanca we learned how to win and defend technically. However, there is another way to win if technique alone isn’t enough and that is with the help of psychology. This is what Nimzowitsch managed to do against the same opponent of Capablanca, and in the same type of ending! Compared with the game against Capablanca, Duras had an improved position – but he still lost. How that happened can be useful to know from the perspective of both the winner and the loser.




Duras has managed to set up the strongest defensive pawn wave formation h4-g3-f2 which is the safest way to head for a draw when playing with three pawns versus four on the same wing. How can Black play for a win in such a situation? Nimzowitsch tried to make his opponent tired and careless by doing nothing. As a matter of fact there is 

nothing Black can do. By playing in this “innocent” manner Nimzowitsch managed to fool his opponent. Let’s see how he did it.




Nimzowitsch played

However, the strongest move was 34 f4! preventing Black from activating his e-pawn. In this position the absolute seventh rank means nothing since Black is unable to activate his king without losing a bunch of pawns on the kingsde. A plausible continuation would then be 34...

Nimzowitsch plays a patient and demanding waiting game. Technically 34...e5 is the logical move, preparing the activation of Black’s pawn position as much as possible and then trying to squeeze White to death.

Very clever play by Nimzowitsch who had strong fighting spirit as well as high-level psychological capabilities. On a superficial level Black’s plan is apparently to manoeuvre his king to f6 after which the h5-pawn must be defended. Duras’ priority in this situation seems to have been the prevention of the king reaching f6.




57 

♖

g5??




Duras wanted to limit the activity of Black’s king but forgot what Black could do with White’s rook!







57...f5!




Wow! One can just imagine Nimzowitsch’s euphoria when he 

trapped the white rook. Black’s winning plan is to manoeuvre the rook to g4 and force a pawn ending where the extra pawn can be exploited for a win.

This endgame has never been kind to Duras who lost twice in a painful way instead of achieving two solid draws. In particular, the endgame against Nimzowitsch must have been a nightmare but all the same it showed what a skilful psychological player Nimzowitsch was. He simply hypnotised his opponent! Such ability is an important component in habitually winning games, or turning half points into full points.




If Duras can be manipulated like this, then the moral of the story is that it could easily happen to other chessplayers too. Remember that this psychological method of inducing your opponent to lose concentration can be used in other “dry” positions. But the secret is to find an idea which involves something similar to the imaginative 56...

♖

h8(!!) and that includes all other subtle moves before the crucial move itself is actually played as well as perfect timing when to snare the opponent.

Eliskases – Bogoljubow

Match 1939

White to move







Here it is actually preferable to have a doubled pawn on f3 rather than on the normal g2 or g3 squares. This is because there are no 

profitable pawn exchanges for Black. Another advantage of the damaged pawn structure is that the king can be placed actively on g3. However, one drawback is the open g-file which might be exploited by Black.




27 

♖

a1 g5




Znosko-Borovsky suggests the interesting idea of placing the rook on g5 and forcing the king to declare its intentions. If White places it on f1 Black can strive for the following set-up: pawns on f6 and e5 and then to advance the king to h3, targeting the weak h2-pawn. If White tries to stop the king when it is placed on h5 by placing the rook on the fourth rank, Black can advance the f-pawn to f4 blocking the rook. In that position the black rook defends both the g7- and e5-pawns and Black’s king can advance to h3 and pick up the h2-pawn. This is probably the best practical winning chance for Black.




If White meets the check on g5 with 

♔

h1 Black can try to reach the other side with his king and focus his attention on the f-pawns or a rook exchange. A plausible variation is 27...

Compared to Znosko-Borovsky’s ambitious plan, Bogoljubow’s play was rather uninspired. This is an excellent position to play out with the computer – with both colours! The ending is a theoretical draw but since it involves some pitfalls if the attacker plays accurately, it’s worth investigating more deeply. It’s a rather common rook ending in practical play. I had the doubled pawns myself once and managed to draw with a significantly higher rated player, but of course I already knew the above mentioned endgame from one of Euwe’s endgame books!

Spielmann – Rubinstein

Saint Petersburg 1909

Black to move







This famous example, featuring Rubinstein in his prime playing the leading role, is illuminating since it shows how to play against weak and isolated pawns with the help of optimal activity and cooperation by the rook and the king.




In this position White has four pawn islands and Rubinstein puts early pressure on two of the pawns, far away from the defending king.

Flohr – Vidmar

Nottingham 1936

White to move







White has a small positional advantage consisting of his better pawn structure (two pawn islands versus three) and stronger rook and king. Despite these significant advantages it’s not so easy to convert them to a win. Firstly, you need a high level of technical precision and, secondly, it’s not possible to win against precise defence. In practice it’s not easy to defend these kinds of endings and even famous masters and grandmasters make mistakes that eventually lead to a loss.

endings are drawn when material has been reduced.

Chigorin – Tarrasch

Budapest 1896

White to move







There is no doubt that White has the advantage with his more active pieces as well as the better pawn position but with precise play Black can still draw. It’s because of such positions we have the famous saying that all rook endings are drawn. Chigorin first improved the placement of his king.

Black stops once and for all the advance of White’s h-pawn. Another idea was to cut off the king with 28...

Flohr – Petrovs

Semmering-Baden 1937

White to move







Superficially this position looks dangerous for the great endgame expert Salo Flohr, since Black has a rook exerting pressure on f2 and a distant passed pawn supported by his king. However, a more important asset is that White has only one pawn chain whereas Black’s is split into three parts. This endgame has the same theme as the previous Chigorin – Tarrasch game but here Black is far more active and can achieve a draw by precise play.

A beautifully conducted rook ending by Flohr. Apart from his 43

rd

 move it was played to perfection. It strikes one that Flohr handled the pawns according to the famous principles of Philidor, who had a great belief in pawn chains and the collective mobility of the pawns. Black had possibilities of holding the draw but that demanded more activity and above all more concrete play. This rook ending, like many others, only goes to show that rook endings are indeed difficult to play.

Kashdan – Alekhine

Olympiad, Folkestone 1933

In this situation it’s possible to sacrifice material for activity. Black parts with his least valuable pawn in order to prevent White’s king from advancing to e3.




It’s possible to play in a passive manner such as 38...

This rook ending has some similarities to the famous one between Capablanca and Tartakower, 

position 258

, which showed that in rook endings you must sometimes sacrifice one or even two pawns for activity. In one variation after 43 h4 f4!! we even saw a sacrifice of three pawns! So the moral is that you should never be afraid of sacrificing one pawn for activity when the great masters are ready to sacrifice two or even three in some rare cases!

Capablanca – Tartakower

New York 1924

White to move







This classic position is a world famous example demonstrating in the most instructive manner that activity is more important than material in rook endings. White’s rook and king are much stronger than their counterparts since the black king is cut off on the last rank. If White activates his king on g6 or f6 White will win, since the 

cooperation between the king, rook and g5-pawn will be too much for Black to handle in the position.




Capablanca played the delicious move

Korchnoi – Karpov

White’s king is more active than its counterpart and can support the breakthrough a5-a6 (or d4-d5) after 

♔

c3 and 

♔

b4 and at the same time penetrate the black position via a5 and b6 with pressure on the c6-pawn. Another advantage in White’s position is that he has three pawns on the fifth rank, which is an undoubted advantage if it all comes down to a pawn race. The pawn on f5 provides the white rook with an outpost on e6 which might come in be handy in view of the weak pawn on c6 after White has played a5-a6. Korchnoi played

This instructive rook ending showed that it’s difficult even for the best players in the world to realise the right moment for the breakthrough. One should consider that during this period games were adjourned and players also had more thinking time for the last phase of the game. Moreover Korchnoi had the reputation of being a good rook endgame player. He even wrote a book about it, 

Practical Rook Endings.




Don’t forget to study those important rook endings you must know by heart. Spassky used to say that is good advice but to follow it is the harder part! It’s because of such statements that even strong players make mistakes in rook endings again and again. I know several grandmasters who openly admit they ignore the study of rook endings, but the very best players in the world don’t!




We now go on to multi-piece endings, with at least two pieces on each side.

It’s not so difficult for the defender to hold the draw against a rook and

Black easily holds the draw by alternating checks with a pinning of the knight.

Try to play this ending with a computer and you’ll see it’s not so difficult to grasp its main principles.

The main idea with the second-rank-defence is not to allow the king to be driven back to the last rank so if White now checks the king it’s not possible to keep the rook on the second rank since Black’s king slips out again on the next move.

Dautov – Korchnoi

Switzerland 2003

Black to move







Rook and knight versus rook and knight is the third to fourth most common endgame featuring two pieces each. According to Flear’s investigations it’s also the most tactical endgame. Small positional advantages like a pawn majority or active pieces become more important with this material distribution.

It was by very active defence that Korchnoi managed to hold the draw and his knight manoeuvre to the corner was indeed impressive.

Such endings are therefore especially difficult to play with little time on the clock.

White to move







The reader who doesn’t believe or understand why this pawn ending is lost should look at it in more detail. Black’s plan is simply to play ...b6-b5 followed by ...a5-a4. In such a situation Black’s threats are twofold:




a) He wants to attack the c-pawn with the king.




b) He wants to create a passed pawn on the kingside and lure the defending king to that side of the board.




In the meantime Black picks up the c- and a-pawn and then queens the a-pawn. There is not much White can do. Play might go 40 c4+ 

♔

e5! 41 b4 f5 42 h3 h4! 43 c5 bxc5 44 bxa5 f4+ 45

35 h3 would have slowed down Black’s advance of the kingside pawns. However, the drawback is the dark-square weaknesses on the kingside which might tell in the future.




35...g4







In this position it’s clearly apparent that the black pawn majority, combined with Black’s active rook and bishop (and king!), is more dangerous than White’s which hasn’t yet begun to advance.




36 

♗

d3 h4!?




Black plans to disrupt White’s pawns on the long diagonal with ...h4-h3. The normal continuation was the activation of the king. After 36...

39 c3?!




It’s easy to understand White’s reluctance to mobilise his majority on the queenside, especially now when Black has already established a passer. However, the problem is that the pawns will not travel far due to the weakness of the c4-square after the pawn advances to b4. From that point of view it’s better to play a waiting game with moves like 39

 game! If you know this particular ending without pawns by heart, then due to the resources present there, it’s possible to save many difficult endings where there are pawns involved. In other words: even if the ending doesn’t arise on the board it certainly does when you calculate the variations.

The lesson we can learn from this endgame is that although White had an active rook and bishop as well as an extra pawn, which was an outside passer, it demanded precise play to win. It’s difficult to win on the queenside alone so White needed an additional weakness on the kingside. With rook and knight and perhaps one pawn, Black can create annoying tactical possibilites and make it harder for White to win. Black actually laid the foundations by exchanging pawns on the kingside and then managed to survive a piece down after all the pawns had been exchanged.

Rook and bishop versus rook and knight is the most common endgame with two pieces each and it will arise approximately in every eleventh game. Such statistical information means it’s necessary to make a special study of this ending and learn the principles of playing with this material relationship.




According to the general rule, rook and bishop are stronger than rook and knight but Flear doesn’t agree with this superficial estimation since it doesn’t tally with his careful investigation. Of course we receive this important knowledge with a warm heart and become aware of it whenever we are in contact with this type of ending. Primarily, very small changes in the pawn structure or a more active king can change the general evaluation of such a position drastically.

♗

Here the bishop is definitely stronger than the knight since there is a completely open centre and possibilities for playing on both wings. Now the bishop puts pressure on the f1-a6 diagonal and the a6-pawn is forced to declare its intentions.




The knight lacks an active outpost and therefore this is a difficult ending to handle for Black. When playing with two pieces it’s very important that both of them are gainfully employed because if one of them is ineffective it can be enough to lose the game because of that factor alone.




The ideal situation for the defender would be to have his knight placed on d4 and the c2-pawn on c4. This change would not only improve the knight dramatically, it would also make the bishop significantly worse. 

The knight usually prefers closed positions or those with a shorter front line.

This is the third to fourth most common endgame with two pieces on each side. It will occur in every 25

th

 game that you play. What’s important to think about is that small positional advantages can be decisive if the opponent lacks counterplay and is unable to generate threats or activity. This situation might very well happen if you are saddled with a bad bishop.

White has correctly played according to the no-hurry-principle but how can White play for a win in a more concrete fashion when it’s not possible for his king to enter Black’s position? The answer is that White simply has to open the game to exploit his advantage in mobility.

It might seem paradoxical to exchange Black’s weakness on a5 and liberate Black’s rook but this is the kind of creative technique which leads to a situation where the passed pawn will be dangerous and so the principle of the two weaknesses is on the agenda.

Endings with two rooks versus two rooks are the fifth most common

White to move







Ivanchuk played 

25 h4!

.




The weak queenside and the isolated pawn on e5 are not enough for White to win so he must provoke a third weakness. The idea of advancing the h-pawn is to play the g-pawn to g6 with the help of the h-pawn. White must expand on the kingside to be able to win. That’s the only chance.




25...

♖

e8




Black wants to make a four-rookswap and then centralise the king on e6 and quickly play ...b7-b5 and ...

♘

b7. This forces White to play b2-b4 after which Black can get rid of his doubled pawn and play ...c6-c5. The natural 25...h5 means that Black hopes to keep the position closed but that strategy isn’t realistic, since White can play a timely g3-g4 and activate his king in the process.




26 g4




White wants to play his pawns to g5 and h5, followed by 

♘

g4 with pressure on the e5-pawn.




26...

♘

White pawns on h5 and g4 against g7 and h6 lead to a structure where White can occupy the f5-square with his knight. After an exchange on f5 White will have a pawn majority on the kingside following e4xf5.

He regards this as a beautiful move because it’s an original finesse to lure the e7-rook to d7 and in that way manage to defend the d5-pawn indirectly by playing the rook to c1 with pressure on the c7-pawn. This motif is very unusual but good to know, since correct play with two rooks can be tricky with all those ranks and files to think about.

278-300: Queen Endings




A characteristic feature of queen endings is that one must always be aware of the safety of the king, especially when there are more pieces cooperating with the queen such as one or two rooks. They demand a lot of calculation and therefore a study of the most important positions is mandatory in order to make them easier to handle.




Among these positions is a high frequency of queen endings without pawns, but that’s because it will then be easier to understand the peculiarities of the queen. The deep knowledge that will be assimilated can then be used in other positions by way of analogy. So it’s not the endgame itself that is important, it’s a knowledge of the queen’s innate capabilities.

Queen against pawn is normally a win unless there is a rook pawn or a bishop pawn on the seventh rank. If that is the case the attacker’s king must be close enough to be able to win. The study by Horowitz shows how to win when the pawn is on the sixth rank.

When I studied this endgame from Pachman’s

What is really impressive about this endgame is how the attacker uses the queen over practically the whole board. Particularly the waiting moves on the last rank are a key part of the beautiful manoeuvring technique.

Pachman

Endpielpraxis im Schach 1977

White to move







When the knight is protected by the bishop and the bishop is protected by the king the defender has the possibility of constructing a fortress. In the following position Black cannot break through if White is careful to move the bishop from b2 to a1 and back to b2 and so on.

The lesson to be learned is that the position is lost if the defender lacks harmony in his position. This has been known since 1843 when Bilguer showed a study to prove it. A famous practical example is Pachman – Guimard, 1955.

5...

♔

d2 6 

♔

...and Black cannot improve his position.




It has been known since 1903, in a study by Karstedt, that this is a drawn position. Black can manoeuvre his king back to c4 and then go to b4 and a4 after having put the queen on d1 but it is the same draw as we have already seen but from another perspective. This is an important fortress to remember as is the cooperation displayed by the bishop and knight. Notice that the knight is placed on a square of the same colour as the bishop and thus controls squares of an opposite colour.




This is a useful construction to remember in the other phases of the games as well. The reason for its importance is the harmony displayed by the three forces, especially the one between the bishop and the knight. The ending in itself is very unusual. I have had it only once in my life when I was a junior and I managed to win with the queen.

With the help of a triangular manoeuvre (The movement from a5 to e5 to a1 back to a5 is in the shape of a triangle.) Black is forced to move the rook away from the king and then White wins the rook by force with the help of checks.




For example:

Carlsen – Aronian

Elista 2007

White to move







In the old days when adjournments were the order of the day this position might very well have been agreed drawn without further play. When Black’s king controls the blockading squares of the pawn it’s a theoretical draw. However, with today’s time control you should play on in this ending. It’s not so easy to hold the draw. Just see what happened to Aronian when he had to defend this drawn ending against Carlsen.

It’s useful for the defender to remember that it is very dangerous to allow the white king to travel too far down the board since then precise defensive play is required from Black.

Ciocaltea – Unzicker

Moscow 1956M

Black to move







Black should play according to a three-step-plan:




1) Centralisation of the queen.




2) Advance of the king into enemy territory.




3) Advance of the f-pawn to decide the game.




The game continued:




52...

♕

c1+ 53 

♔

h2 

♕

f4+ 54 g3




Pachman and Averbakh believe Black’s winning chances increase after this move, but White still keeps the draw with correct play. As a matter of a fact, with the pawns placed on g3 and h4 White holds the draw without any problems, but the f3-square should be looked after as Black can exploit it if White isn’t careful.




According to Pachman the golden rule in queen endings is the security of the king and that is the reason White should prefer 54 

♔

h1. Averbakh also prefers this move as the safer option. The drawback is that Black has an alternative plan to the advance of the king and that is to push the g-pawn to g3, creating mating threats on the last rank. 54 

♔

g1 is a recommendation by Giddins but the king is slightly more exposed here for timely central checks along the classical diagonal (a7-g1), so the recommendation by Pachman and Averbakh is more precise.




54...

♕

f3




The queen stands in an excellent attacking position and is defending the f7-pawn as well.

According to Dvoretsky the position is a draw if White doesn’t allow the black king to penetrate the white position.

Alekhine – Reshevsky

AVRO tournament, Holland 1938

White to move







According to Averbakh the defender has good drawing chances when, as here, the attacker has weakened his king’s position. The second rank is weak and White’s king position would have been safer with the pawn on f2 instead of f3.

In contrast to rook endings, the defender can temporarily place his queen in a passive offside position in front of the passed pawn. There will normally be room for annoying checks later when White strives to go to b6 with the queen. In rook endings it’s easy to start advancing the king but here, for the time being, it has no effect.

According to Fine and Dvoretsky this ending is a draw. Speelman thinks White has good winning chances. Whatever the great endgame experts say, everyone should be careful in this type of ending because of the presence of queens.

Reshevsky – Fine

Nottingham 1936

Black to move







In the tournament book Alekhine thinks that Black has an easy defence if he walks with the king to the centre and thereby halts the future passed pawn on the d-file. White’s exposed king will also help Black and give him counterchances. Fine doesn’t agree and thinks White has good winning chances. Normally the winning chances are greater the more pawns you have. It should be easier to play for a win with five versus four compared with four versus three.

Rubinstein – Capablanca

Saint Petersburg 1914

Black to move







Black is a pawn down and the c5-pawn is under attack. White’s queen is more active than Black’s. Black’s 

only chance of staying alive is to exploit the pawn majority on the queenside to create a passed pawn. In queen endings one of the golden rules is that it is more important to have a passed pawn than a material advantage of one or even several pawns.

An excellent move which exploits the fact that it is easier for Black to create a passed pawn than it is for White.

Here the players agreed to a 

draw

.




In the main variation we saw that Black obtained a dangerous passed pawn on the a-file, while in the sidelines Black got passers on the bor c-file. It doesn’t matter on which file the passer is created, more important is that it’s an advanced passed pawn which can neutralise a material disadvantage and offer a balanced position – and for this a passed pawn is necessary in order to force the opponent to go for perpetual checks. If it’s not possible to create a passed pawn, then another way to achieve good drawing chances is to exchange all the pawns on the queenside and try to hold with, say, three pawns against four on the kingside.




The present work classifies the next four queen and rook endgames as “NQE” (“Not Quite an Endgame”), pronounced “nuckie” to use the term introduced by Flear, and I thereby go against the definition of Speelman who says that this should be regarded a middlegame. After all, queen and rook has the value 9 + 5 = 14 and not 13 which is Speelman’s clever definition of an endgame. However, this endgame is obviously a borderline case.

Flear – Lejeune

If one side has an extra pawn but a more exposed king the situation is often unpredictable. In practice this means it’s often fine to be a pawn down if the opponent has the worse king’s position.

Larsen – Keres

San Antonio 1972

White to move







Compared with other endgames where the attacker has four pawns versus three on the same side, here the game can be sharp. White’s extra pawn is not so easy to exploit and this particular endgame was even lost by Larsen! That says something about the difficulties in playing with major pieces. You must always take care with the king’s position.




31 

♖

d6 g6




Black has set up the wave which is the best defensive structure if White exchanges to a rook ending. As a rule White should avoid the exchange of rooks and in the worst case scenario play a queen ending, but the best is to keep all the major pieces on the board.

Principally the defender should strive for an exchange of queens and if this isn’t possible then the second best is an exchange of rooks. The attacker tries to retain the queen and rook while introducing a third attacker, preferably the e-pawn. The other pawns should protect the king from counterattack.




We now turn to two positions where the attacker has a positional advantage. In the first case we are discussing the isolated pawn and in the second how a more active position can be exploited by an unexpected breakthrough in the centre.

Giri – Dominguez Perez

Novi Sad 2016

White to move







Black has just played 28...f5 preventing White from winning a pawn with e3-e4. Such further weakening moves (the second rank becomes vulnerable) are typical of positions with an isolated pawn. When there are only major pieces on the board the isolani actually becomes weaker due to the strong pressure on the d-file.




29 h4!




White plans the pawn push to h5 in order to fix the g7-pawn and artificially isolate the f5-pawn.

d7 30

c3!




A good manoeuvre with the queen, exploiting the fact that Black cannot attack it on the c-file with the rook.

♔

f7 31 h5







The principle of two weaknesses is clearly visible here. Both f5 and g7 are potential future weaknesses, as well as d5 and to a certain extent a7, so in reality Black has four weaknesses.

f6 32 

♖

d4




Notice how White uses the manoeuvring square d4 when mobilising the rook to the fourth rank. The change of pieces on the d4-pivot is typical for manoeuvring when playing against several weaknesses.

By placing the king in an exposed position Black risks having a fifth 

weakness consisting of His Royal Highness himself. The safest was to play 32...

h7. King safety is the number one thing when playing with queen and rook.

White wants to clarify the situation and create a concrete weakness on the queenside.

Here it’s clearly visible that Black has four pawn weaknesses. Since White has the more active pieces it’s very difficult for Black to defend them all in practical chess. Black must also consider the safety of his king which certainly must be counted as a fifth weakness.

Rozentalis – Engqvist

White to move







I must confess that I had completely overlooked the ingenious and seemingly impossible move:




51 d5!!

.




Next day somebody told Rozentalis that Kasparov had played something similar where Black could take on d5 with three pieces.

c8 was the best but to play a position where White has a protected pawn on d6 is of course futile in the long run. Black can hardly move and has three weaknesses apart from his passive major pieces: the c6-pawn must be taken care of, the d6-pawn kept under surveillance and especially the f7-pawn must be protected if Black wants to manoeuvre his king to h6.

What is fascinating with the theme “impossible breakthrough” is that it’s very unusual. But it has happened twice to me and against the same player! As a matter of fact it already happened in a game in Stockholm the last day of 2006.







Rozentalis played what for me was a shocking move, namely 43...b4!?. If I play 44 axb4? Black plays 44…a3 45 bxa3 

♖

xc3+ followed by 46…

♖

xa3. In the game I played 44 cxb4 and after 44…

♔

f8 45

d3 

♖

d8 the game was in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Nevertheless I managed to lose after 63 moves apparently because I was overly 

impressed by the impossible move 43…b4!? as well as his faultless technique using the bishop pair.




Another thing concerning pawn breakthroughs is that there is a book, 

Pawn Sacrifice!,

 by IM Timothy Taylor and he has charted all kinds of pawn sacrifices. All the same he has forgotten or missed the “impossible break” where at least two pawns can take the sacrificed pawn. He mentions two examples of this rare kind of break in connection with a king attack and line opening but makes no further investigation of it. In this collection of important positions Nos. 

103

,

,

 and

 contain such a surprising pawn break. Don’t forget it! It’s not enough, as Nimzowitsch wrote in his famous books, to trammel a pawn, it must be blockaded permanently to stop its lust to expand.

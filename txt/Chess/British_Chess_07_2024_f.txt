WILL DING LIREN 
DEFEND HIS 
TITLE?
Can Ding Liren, struggling with poor 
performances and health issues, defend his 
World Chess Championship title against 
rising stars and mounting pressure?
When Ding Liren became World Champion 
in Astana last May, not many people 
praised his play in the match. More than 
a year later, the world champion is seldom 
seen at events, and when he does appear, he 
performs poorly.
Several factors contribute to the question: 
Will Ding defend his title? With the 
17-year-old Gukesh making a convincing 
appearance in Toronto and winning the title 
of Challenger, many believe the new world 
champion will be from India.
Another relevant indicator is the interest 
FIDE has received from bidders in organizing 
the forthcoming World Championship 
Match, set to take place from November 
20 to December 15. Only three bids were 
submitted: one from Singapore and two 
from India (New Delhi and Chennai; FIDE 
chose Singapore). One FIDE insider noted 
the difficulty in raising interest because 
Magnus Carlsen isn’t competing, there isn’t 
a player from the West taking part, and 
neither Ding nor Gukesh are well-known in 
the West. Additionally, Ding’s performance 
hasn’t generated much excitement.
There was hope in FIDE – and the chess 
world – that China would do more after Ding 
clinched the title. Both world champions – 
in the absolute and women’s categories – 
are from China. However, China has not 
only failed to organize new events but has 
also backed out of commitments to host 
events it initially agreed to. This is another 
indicator that something isn’t right.

BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 387
Speculation about Ding Liren has been 
growing, especially since the Candidates 
Tournament. Recently, at Norway Chess 
(see the analysis in this issue of BCM), 
Ding finished in last place. He suffered four 
consecutive defeats, causing him to fall 
out of the top ten in the world. Ding told 
the Hindustan Times that he considered 
dropping out of the tournament, adding: 
"Earlier, I wasn’t emotional. After some 
things happened in life, I’ve become more 
emotional. Now after each loss…how do I 
put it... I’m very sad, very upset."
Speculation about Ding’s health is fueled by 
his own statements. In an interview in April this 
year, he mentioned problems with exhaustion 
and sleep, which had led to depression, and 
that he had been treated in a clinic twice.
In Norway, Hikaru Nakamura weighed in: “I’ve 
played Ding many times, we’re colleagues 
over the years, but he definitely doesn’t seem 
like the same person.” Nakamura’s comments 
are relevant because, if Ding drops out, the 
American will take his place, having finished 
second in the Candidates.
I was in New York in June for the World 
Corporate Team Championships. At a 
reception following the opening ceremony, 
I ended up chatting with Hikaru Nakamura 
and a few others. One person asked about 
the elephant in the room: “Do you think 
Ding will drop out and are you preparing 
for the match?”
Nakamura’s reaction was as expected: he said 
he thinks it is more likely that Ding will play 
than abdicate. Nakamura refused to comment 
on whether he is preparing for the match but 
indicated that such a scenario is quite plausible.
There are several reasons why it might be 
realistic for Ding to drop out: his questionable 
health, lack of public appearances, poor 
performances in events he does play in, 
lack of initiative in the chess world, and the 
absence of visible support or interest from 
China. On the other hand, if he plays and 
loses, he would lose his title but still receive 
a decent share of the $2.5 million prize fund, 
so why would he abandon that?
Finally, there are those who hope Ding will 
drop out. A match between an American, the 
popular chess streamer Hikaru Nakamura, 
and the youngest and strongest Indian hope, 
Gukesh, would be a much greater spectacle 
and draw more attention both inside and 
outside of the chess world.
Whatever the outcome, interesting times 
lie ahead.

This year the chess world celebrates the 
centenary of the formation of The International 
Chess Federation - FIDE. However, the first 
idea about forming a world body of chess 
was discussed 10 years earlier, in 1914, by the 
German and Russian Chess Federation and, 
before then, the idea was considered by the 
British Chess Federation.
The outbreak of the First World War laid 
those ideas to rest. (Ironically, 100 years after, 
chess again finds itself in the web of problems 
caused by the games of Great Powers.)
It was not until 1924 when Pierre Vincent, 
the General Secretary of the French Chess 
Federation, brought the idea of FIDE back 
to life. On 20th July 1924, in Paris, during 
the 8th Olympic Games representatives of 
15 chess federations came together to form 
the governing body of chess. A century 
later, the chess world will again be meeting 
in Paris on 20th July, just before the kick−off 
of the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, held 
in the French capital.
Of course, no chess event is complete 
without a chess tournament, and that was 
the case in 1924 and the forming of FIDE. 
In the town hall of the 9th Arrondissement 
in Paris, 54 players from 18 countries came 
together for a tournament.
In the following lines, Alan Smith reminds 
us of some of the great names and games 
from this time and digs deeper into the 
history of FIDE, which BCM will write 
more about in the coming issues.

QUOTES AND QUERIES BY ALAN SMITH
A CENTURY OF FIDE:
TRACING THE JOURNEY FROM 1924

July 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 389
6256 The first tournament organised 
by 
FIDE 
was 
the 
Amateur World 
Championship, held in Paris to coincide with 
the 1924 Olympic Games. Paradoxically the 
tournament took place before the meeting 
which established the organisation!
There were 54 entrants divided into nine 
groups. Only the group winners would qualify 
for the final group. The other competitors 
would meet in an eight−round Swiss system.
Play commenced on 12th July at the Majestic 
Hotel. Here, we will pick up the story after 
round four of the preliminary groups.
There were three players with 100% scores, 
Apscheneek 
(Apsenieks) 
in 
Group 
5, 
Chepurnov in Group 7 and Havasi in Group 
8. All three were already guaranteed a place 
in the championship final. Mattison (Matisons) 
in group 1 needed a draw to join them and he 
duly achieved this. Colle and Vajda led by half 
a point and were also successful. The round 
five games in the other groups saw a change in 
the top of the order. Roberto Grau beat Euwe 
in round three and was still in pole position 
in Group 3. Euwe won, while Grau defended 
too passively and was well beaten by Marin. 
Group 9 saw Skalicka lose, to be overtaken 
by both Palau and Romih. Group 6 was also 
a close run, Golmayo and Schulz tied with 4, 
Golmayo was placed first on tie break.
The nine−player final was a hard−fought 
affair. Golmayo led with +2=1 but then 
lost two in a row. After five rounds Mattison 
and Colle were on +2 while Euwe and 
Chepurnov had +1. These players met in 
round 6. Euwe beat Mattison, while Colle 
was defeated by Chepurnov. Just behind 
them Apscheneek seemed to have blown his 
chance by losing to Vajda. Round 7 provided 
the surprise of the event when Euwe lost with 
white to Palau. Mattison was on +2 Colle, 
Euwe and Chepurnov on +1, these four 
could all hope to win the gold medal. Colle 
had the bye in round 8, Euwe lost again and 
was out of the running for first place. Havasi 
followed Euwe’s play from round 6, only to 
find Mattison had an improvement ready.

Mattison was a point clear at the start of the 
last round, but faced Colle; if he loses a three−
way tie was possible. The game was drawn, 
Colle unable to realise an edge, Mattison 
was the champion, Apscheneek made it a 
Latvian double by defeating Chepurnov, 
while Colle was third.

Mattison did better with black than with 
white, +3=2−1 when moving first, +4=3 
with black. Overall the final saw more wins 
for black than white, +15 =13 −8.
6257 The consolation tournament at Paris 
1924 was an eight−round Swiss. Players 
carried forward their scores from the group 
stage. This made Schulz the leader with four 
points, half a point ahead of Davidiescu, 
Grau, Koltanowski, Reca, Romi and 
Voellmy with seven more players on three.
 
Karel Hromadka made the best score in the 
Swiss +5=3, giving him +7 =5−1 overall. 
for first place, half a point ahead of Schulz, 
with Erwin Voellmy in third place. 
Here is a brisk king hunt by the reigning 
French champion, played in round 3 of the 
preliminary stage.

De Nederlander, 29th November 1924 
Renaud scored +6=4−3 to finish 4th equal 
in the consolation group.
Nine of the players were reunited at 
Bromley the following year. Mattison won 
a ten−round tournament, saving his best for 
the four−player final.
6258 The main business of Paris 1924 was 
the founding of Federation International 
des Echecs − FIDE. The fifteen founder 
members met on 20th July, representatives 
from 
Argentina, 
Belgium, 
Canada, 
Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Great 
Britain, 
Hungary, 
Italy, 
Netherlands, 
Poland, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and 
Yugoslavia.
The congress was held less than six 
years after the Great War. There were no 
representatives of Austria or Germany. 
The delegates elected the Dutch player 
Alexander Rueb as the first president of 
FIDE. He continued in that role until 1949.
Three years later, the first Olympiad 
proper was held in London. The attempt to 
distinguish between amateur and professional 
players had been quietly forgotten. Dr 
Tarrasch and Mieses led the German team of 
four, while Austria sent a five−player side led 
by Grunfeld and Lokvenc.

DRAMATIC
FINISHES IN
KENILWORTH:
JONES AND
MIRZOEVA
SEIZE ENGLISH

The English Championships ended 
with a bang in Kenilworth as both the 
Open and the Women’s title was decided 
in tiebreaks.
GMs Gawain Jones and Mickey Adams 
locked horns in the open section while 
WGMs Elmira Mirzoeva and Katarzyna 
Toma squared off in the women’s category. 
All four players had racked up 6 points out 
of seven in the regular rounds.
The playoffs kicked off with two rapid 
games (20|10). If needed, blitz games (5|3) 
followed. An Armageddon game loomed as 
the final decider.
Gawain Jones and Michael Adams entered 
the open section’s final round neck and 
neck. Adams wielding the white pieces 
shook hands with Ameet Ghasi. Jones 
however, slugged it out with Peter Wells 
for 59 moves to force a playoff for the 
crown. In the rapid tiebreakers that 
followed, Jones grabbed the upper hand. 
He snagged a win with black in a queen 
endgame then held firm with white to 
clinch the Championship.
Mirzoeva snagged the women’s crown. She 
drew 1−1 in the rapid games with Toma, 
then she clinched victory by winning both 
blitz games. 
Both Jones and Mirzoeva showed some 
serious grit − they clawed their way back 
from behind in the final round to snatch 
victory in their respective sections.
As Leonard Barden noticed in his article 
for the FT - “Experience triumphed 
over youth at Kenilworth last weekend 
when both the Open and Women’s 
English Championships were won by 
grandmasters. Talents in their twenties, 
teens, and pre−teens had been prominent 
in the early rounds.”
Here we will look at two most interesting 
games from the Open competition of the 
English Championships.
We start with a positional win by Michael 
Adams against Danny Gormally

Black King can assist the passed c−pawn 
to advance.

AN ANSWER TO
TWO BIG QUESTIONS – 
ON CARLSEN AND ON DING
NORWAY CHESS 2024
This year’s edition of Norway Chess took 
place from 27 May to 7 June. It gathered 
most of the world’s elite, including the 
struggling World Champion Ding Liren. 
The tournament was played as a double round−
robin format with a peculiar time control, with 
the players starting with 120 minutes and not 
getting any additional time after move 40, except 
for the increment of 10 seconds per move.
With Carlsen’s last classical game dating 
back to November last year, the two main 
questions that Norway Chess was supposed 
to clarify were: is Carlsen still the best player 
in the world in classical chess and has Ding 
Liren managed to navigate his crisis?
The tournament provided clear answers to both 
questions: yes to the first (though not with the 
same margin as before), and no to the second.

07/144
   | BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE

The second question was answered as early 
as the first round.
In the pre−tournament interviews, Ding 
Liren said that he was confident and ready 
to fight. That is not what we saw in his first−
round game against Carlsen. Playing with 
the White pieces, Ding Liren could have 
gone for a full fight, to confirm his words 
from those interviews, but…

½-½
 
Such a blatant refusal to fight demonstrated 
that Ding’s words were just that - words. 
He was not even close to overcoming his 
crisis and the worst was yet to come.
Norway Chess had Armageddon games in 
case of a draw, with White needing to win 
to gain 1.5 points, while a draw gave Black 
those points. Now forced to play for a win, 
Ding tried, but failed, with Carlsen drawing 
from a position of strength.
The first two rounds saw all draws in 
classical chess, but round three was already 
different. Both Carlsen and Ding Liren lost.
Carlsen chose the risky (for this level) 
Kan Sicilian against Praggnanandhaa. The 
Indian was surprised, but that didn’t stop 
him from demolishing the risk−taker.
 R Praggnanandhaa - Magnus Carlsen 
12th Norway Chess 2024 Stavanger NOR (3.1)
1.e4 c5 2.f3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.xd4 a6 
The Kan Sicilian is a very rare guest 
at elite level, though very popular at 
lower levels, often a favourite choice of 
grandmasters in open tournaments, trying 
to beat lower−rated opposition. What 
works in opens, where the stronger player 
avoids direct confrontation and heavily 
analysed lines in hope to outplay their 
opponent, doesn’t quite work in elite 
events. It’s a strange choice by Carlsen, 
IN THE GAME AGAINST CARLSEN, 
DING DID NOT PLAY AS A WORLD CHAMPION

BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 399
who must have had pleasant memories 
from the white side of the Kan, as he beat 
Anand in game six of their second World 
Championship match in 2014. 
5.d3 One of the main continuations, the 
others two being 5.c3 and 5.c4, the latter 
one being Carlsen’s choice in the afore−
mentioned game. 
5...c7 6.0-0 f6 7.e2 Threatening e5. 
7...d6 8.c4 This was the idea of 5.d3. 
White didn’t block the path of the c−pawn 
with c3 and can now establish a Maroczy 
bind in the centre. 
8...bd7 Another popular plan for Black 
is the fianchetto of the dark−squared bishop 
after 8...g6.

This move proves that Praggnanandhaa 
was surprised by Carlsen’s choice. 
Theory recommends 9.f4, preventing 
Black’s next move. 
9...e5 10.h3 Another rare move as we 
soon exit theory. Thanks to the space 
advantage White keeps an edge, though 
Black can also be happy with the outcome 
of the opening − he got a fighting position 
with the bishop pair (after he takes 
...xd3). 
10...b6 
Carlsen 
decides 
to 
develop 
the queenside first. He probably never 
imagined that his king will never leave the 
centre, otherwise he would have started 
with 10...e7.

White is better developed and wants to

13...d7? Carlsen wants to keep the 
flexible pawn structure, but this hands 
White the initiative. 
13...e5 was necessary. Black gives up pawn 
control of the d5-square, but stabilises the 
position. 14.c2 c8 15.e3 e7 with a 
complex game ahead where both sides have 
their chances. 
WITH CARLSEN’S LAST 
CLASSICAL GAME DATING 
BACK TO NOVEMBER LAST 
YEAR, THE TWO MAIN 
QUESTIONS THAT NORWAY 
CHESS WAS SUPPOSED TO 
CLARIFY WERE: 
IS CARLSEN STILL THE BEST

CLASSICAL CHESS AND 
HAS DING LIREN MANAGED TO

14.g5! e7 15.ad1 White developed

pressure. White would like to continue with 
g3, when there would be pressure against 
the pawn on d6 and along the g−file.

Black wants to keep the white queen tied to 
the defence of the pawn on c4. The engine 
prefers castling, but that was depressing. 
15...0-0 was the last chance to get the king 
out of the centre. However, after 16.g3 e5 
17.xf6 xf6 18.c2 White’s knights are 
better than Black’s bishops, especially after 
e3, when White’s control of d5 would stress 
his domination. Black lacks any counterplay 
here, so perhaps it’s understandable that 
Carlsen didn’t go for this line. 
16.e2! Threatening e5. White has a 
winning advantage now. 
16...e5 17.xf6 xf6 18.c2 c6 Black 
hopes to get some counterplay targeting the 
pawns on e4 and c4. 
19.e3 g5 20.h1 Allowing the exchange 
of the passive dark−squared bishop, but still 
keeping the decisive advantage. 
20.ed5 was more forcing, as after 
20...xc4 21.g4 f6 22.h1 White 
sacrificed a pawn to establish an untouchable 
knight on d5. Still, there was no need for this.

What impresses in this game is the ease 
with which Praggnanandhaa outplayed 
Carlsen after seemingly not−too−serious 
mistakes in the opening. 
This game clearly showed that frivolities in 
the opening are not allowed at elite level. 
Even though objectively Carlsen’s position 
was fine around move 13, the inherent lack 
of solidity that is necessary when playing 
with the black pieces at this level didn’t 
take too long to show.
Ding Liren lost in a fashion that became 
typical of his recent losses.

Caruana introduces a novelty in this well−
explored position, with the main moves 
being 12.f1 and 12.a4. 
12...bxc6 13.a4 White’s idea is to 
concentrate on kingside play with f1-
g3 and the central d4-advance without 
allowing the expanding ...a4 by Black. 
13...d7 Black frees the path for ...f5, but 
also covers the e5-pawn so he can play 
...d5. 
13...b6 14.f1 c5 is the engine’s 
suggestion, but closing in the bishop 
on b6 is not a decision a human would 
take lightly. 
14.f1 
d5 
14...f5 
was 
a

alternative. After 15.exf5 xf5 16.d4

Starting from this point Ding’s play 
starts to show lack of clarity. In two 
moves the queen becomes exposed on 
this square. 
16...b7 would have saved Black a 
tempo compared to the game. 17.g3 
xd4 18.cxd4 dxe4 19.xe4 b3
with counterplay. 
17.e3 White wants to continue with g3, 
as taking now on d4 would win a tempo 
against the queen on b6 and centralise the 
white bishop. Ding still thought that was 
the lesser evil, though. 
17...xd4 17...fd8 was possible. The idea 
is that after 18.g3 xd4 19.xd4 c5! 
is now possible thanks to the rook being 
on the d−file. After 20.exd5 f8! 21.e3 
xd5 Black obtains counterplay.

Black’s position remains compact, though 
he’s on the defensive as White can create 
threats on the kingside. 
21.d2 c5 22.e3 h7 Defending 
against xh6. A typical move for post−
championship Ding Liren: a solid move, 
while at the same time passing by an 
interesting tactical chance, something the 
earlier Ding wouldn’t have done. 
22...xh3!? was a curious tactical 
opportunity that World Champion Ding 
Liren either misses, or doesn’t have the 
confidence to take. 23.gxh3 (23.xh6!? 
xe2 24.xe2 e6 is equal.) 23...e5! 
24.f1 d7 25.g2 g6 gives Black

23...b3! had the same idea to attack 
the pawn on a4, but without allowing b4. 
However, it seems both players missed 
that chance. Here 24.f4 xa4 would 
have transposed to the game. 
24.f4?! 24.b4! was a strong move 
with the idea to gain access to the 
d4-square for the bishop. After 24...
cxb4 25.cxb4 axb4 26.d4 White has 
a stable advantage as his bishop is 
superior and the outside passed a−pawn 
is more dangerous than the blockaded 
d5-pawn. The tactical justification 
of the sequence lies in the fact that 
the pawn on a4 is taboo in view of 
26...xa4? 27.f4! with the threat of f5.

characteristic 
of 
post−championship 
Ding is that he fails to keep the tension

It would seem that this inability to 
withstand pressure, both when seeking 
opportunities for himself and when 
defending, coupled with what appears to 
be a fragile state of mind have plunged 
Ding Liren deep into the throes of 
depression and self−doubt. In Norway, all 
it took was one loss for the whole system 
to collapse again - Ding’s level dropped 
even lower and he started losing game 
after game, to Nakamura, Firouzja and 
eventually Carlsen. The last one deserves 
a special mention.

I saw that the only defence for Black 
was to play 29...h6. So I expected that 
move to come quickly. But the move 
wasn’t coming. Several minutes passed 
and I started wondering if there was a 
glitch with the transmission of moves. 
More minutes passed, still nothing. 
And then, I started wondering, no 
matter how strange that sounded, what 
if Black didn’t notice White’s threat? 
What if he was thinking what to do, 
choosing from several candidate moves 
that may improve his position on the 
queenside...? 
29...b2?? When this move appeared 
on the board, I realised Ding didn’t see 
White’s threat at all. That’s why he was 
thinking, as he thought he had a choice... 
29...h6 30.xd4 xd4 31.xd4 e5 gives 
Black decent compensation for the pawn 
thanks to his well−placed pieces. 
30.xh7+ 30.xh7+ xh7 31.h4# 
1-0
 
An elementary blunder can happen to 
anyone, but this is not a case where it can 
simply be brushed off. To his credit, Ding 
Liren managed to steady the ship and drew 
his remaining games, though he still ended 
up in last place.
The tournament showed that Ding Liren’s 
statements were more an attempt to 
talk himself into a fighting mode rather 
than being in one already. There is still a 
lot of work to be done before the World 
Championship match later in the year, 
scheduled to take place in Singapore from 
20 November, but it won’t be easy for him 
- he failed to pull himself together in more 
than a year after Astana, so doing the same 
in four months is problematic at best.
After the trouncing at the hands of 
Praggnanandhaa, Carlsen gave a very astute 
statement. He said that after that game he 
changed his mindset. He stopped “playing 
for fun” and went into grinding mode. The 
results changed immediately.

Carlsen judges that the knight on g4 doesn’t 
do much, so he just leaves it there. 
It was possible to exchange the knights 
with 19...xg4 20.xg4 g5 and 
after a massive exchange of rooks on 
the f−file the draw isn’t far around 
the corner. 
20.d4 c5 Carlsen continues to grab space 
on the queenside. White’s kingside play 
has come to a standstill, while Black’s on 
the other wing hasn’t, which now makes 
Black’s play somewhat easier. Carlsen 
said after the game that while he wanted to 
make a draw, his appetite started to grow 
as the game progressed. Judging from the 
trend in the game, it is likely that around 
here he felt that he can confidently play on.

to continue with ...c4 and ...c5-d3. 22.c4

can try to use the a−file to continue his play 
on the queenside.

Carlsen realises that he has easier play and

Caruana decides to enter a queen endgame 
a pawn down, which under normal 
circumstances he should draw without 
problems. But the time control at Norway 
Chess was not "normal circumstances." 
Caruana likes to think, so usually by 
move 40 he spends most of his time. 
With no additional time after move 40, 
this meant that he played on the several 
minutes left, plus a 10-second (not 30-
second!) increment to see the game off. 
Playing with eternal time−trouble is a 
guarantee for doom as nobody can play 
without mistakes forever with so little 
time on the clock. Carlsen had more 
time on the clock and he used that to his 
maximum benefit.

Traditionally, his +2 score (three wins 
and one loss) gave him a shared first 
with Nakamura.
Nakamura continued to impress in 
classical chess. He found the formula 
that works for him (“I’m a streamer, 
this is just a hobby, no pressure to earn 
money...”) and he keeps recycling it. 
Using his Candidates preparation he 
was doing fine after the openings and 
his usual resourcefulness and intensity 
were enough to score two wins (against 
Praggnanandhaa 
and 
Ding 
Liren) 
and keep him out of trouble in the 
other games.
Norway Chess again didn’t fail to entertain. 
However, in the end, it’s worth repeating 
a question I read on social media: why is 
Carlsen winning classical rating points by 
winning games which at the end have more 
in common with bullet than classical? It’s a 
valid point and perhaps the organisers will 
consider a more sensible time control next 
time around.

In a groundbreaking moment for English chess, nine-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan 
from Harrow has been selected to represent England at the Chess Olympiad, making her 
the youngest ever to achieve this feat.
Bodhana’s journey into chess began during the 2020 lockdown. Despite the challenges 
posed by the pandemic, she discovered a passion for the game and started honing her skills. 
Just 15 months after learning chess, she got noticed by Leonard Barden who described her 
as "exceptional".
In 2022, Bodhana shared her love for the game: "I love to play chess because it helps me 
to recognise patterns, focus my attention, and is helping me to learn how to strategise 
and calculate moves in advance. Also, I like the way the chess pieces move on the board, 
especially the knight."
Bodhana’s list of achievements is remarkable for her age. In 2022, she dominated the 
European Schools age group championships in Rhodes, winning all 24 games and securing 
three gold medals. She continued to shine as she defeated former British chess champion 
Peter Lee in an exhibition match in 2023. By March 2024, she had risen to become the 
world’s number one under−10 girl.
The preparation for the Chess Olympiad involves rigorous training, building of team spirit, 
and sharing knowledge among teammates. Bodhana’s selection is particularly significant 
as it marks her as the youngest ever participant in the England team, showcasing her 
extraordinary talent and dedication to the sport. Also, her age will put both her and the rest 
of the team in a somewhat unusual situation and it will be interesting to see what chemistry 
can be conjured up among them.
While Bodhana’s future in chess is still unfolding, she is undoubtedly on the path of 
becoming a great champion. 
Bodhana Sivanandan’s story is a testament to the incredible heights that can be reached 
with passion, dedication, and talent.
BCM wishes her luck and we will be following her closely!

The Cairns Cup, held from June 13 to 23, 
marked a milestone in women's chess by 
RৼHULQJDSUL]HIXQGFRPSDUDEOH
to top-tier open category events like the 
6LQTXH¿HOG &XS +RZHYHU QRW HYHU\RQH
ZDVKDSS\DERXWWKHSUL]HV
The Cairns Cup, which took place from 13 
to 23 June, is for women’s chess what the 
Sinquefield Cup is for the open category.
After Norway Chess, which had a women’s 
event running in parallel to the open 
category, the Cairns Cup was the second 
event in close succession where a top−
level women’s tournament saw the players 
compete for similar prizes to the elite 
events in the open category. The total prize 
fund at the Cairns Cup was $200,000.
This increase in the prize money sparked 
some debate in the public: most welcomed 
the increased earning opportunities for 
women in chess, though there were other 
voices as well, who argued that it wasn’t 
entirely fair that a male player rated 2368 
(like Alice Lee) or 2457 (like Elisabeth 
Paehtz) − to take two random ratings from 
the event − would never in his lifetime get 
a chance to play a top−level event with that 
type of prize money, implying there was 
reverse discrimination.
These types of arguments are never−
ending in the chess world and both sides 
are heavily entrenched in their convictions. 
What is certain, though, is that more money 
in chess is definitely a good thing and the 
chess public should be grateful to Jeanne 
Cairns and Rex Sinquefield.
The event gathered some of the best 
players in the world and mixed them with 
US players. Apart from the legendary 
players like Krush and Zatonskih, a chance 
was given to one of the young talents 
Alice Lee and it has to be said that she 
didn’t disappoint. She scored 4/9, beating 
Kosteniuk and Zatonskih, finishing on 
shared seventh place. Her win against 
the former World Champion was a fine 
counter−attacking effort.

American chess has produced its fair 
share of young talents, but they have all 
inevitably chosen to pursue education 
instead of a chess career. Many parents 
in the USA see chess as a way for their 
children to obtain a good scholarship 
thanks to their chess achievements. This 
means that a lot is invested in the child’s 
chess development in the beginning, but the 
moment the child gets a good scholarship, 
chess is immediately abandoned.
Alice Lee (14) is the youngest American 
female to achieve the IM title. With all the 
support she can enjoy in the USA she can 
certainly have a good professional career, 
but whether she chooses that or prefers the 
road of education, only time will tell.
The event was dominated by two players 
who played at the Candidates: Tan Zhongyi 
and Anna Muzychuk. While Tan won the 
Candidates quite dominantly, Muzychuk 
had an awful event in Toronto. As Garry 
Kasparov used to say, no chess preparation 
goes to waste, it is all a matter of timing. For 
Muzychuk, the timing when her form and 
preparation coincided with the period after 
the Candidates. She scored an undefeated 
+2 at both Norway Chess and the Cairns 
Cup, both times finishing clear second 
behind a Chinese player - World Champion 
Ju Wenjun in Norway and Tan Zhongyi in 
the USA.
The curious thing is that Muzychuk scored 
her two wins in the last two rounds. In the 
last one she outplayed Lee from an equal 
rook endgame.

White already repeated the position once 
by giving a check on d8 and returning to 
d7 and now she tries the only possible 
way to keep the game going. 
34.c5 e8 The only move. 
34...bxc5? 35.d8+ e8 36.xe8+ xe8

White won a pawn, but Black’s active 
rook should provide enough counterplay 
for a draw. 
38.xa6 xf2 39.a7 f6? Black goes 
for the wrong pawn. 
39...xg2 was the correct move. One of 
the best ways to steer the game towards 
draw is the reduction of material and 
here Black achieves it. By taking on g2 
Black also threatens to eliminate one 
more pawn, the one on g3. With only 
a and c−pawns on the board, very often 
Black can draw without any pawns on 
her own. 40.b4 xg3 41.xf7 g1 
with the ideas to give checks from the 
back and to push the g−pawn should 
secure the draw for Black.

g−pawns are worth nothing while White

the same time.

40...c8? But Black goes in the wrong 
direction. 
40...e8! ensures that Black doesn’t lose 
the f7-pawn. This means that she can create 
a passed pawn on the kingside later on. 
41.b4 xc6 42.d2 b6+! 43.c5 a6 
44.b5 a3 makes it harder for White to 
advance the a−pawn while after 45.b4 
xg3 46.a4 g4+ Black will be able to place 
the rook behind the a−pawn and then create 
counterplay with her 3 vs 1 on the kingside. 
41.d4 It was also possible to go to b4. 
41.b4 xc6 42.xf7 with the same plan 
to push the a−pawn and place the rook 
behind the a−pawn. 
41...xc6 42.xf7 c2?!
42...a6 was more resilient. 43.f2 a3 
44.c2+ d7 45.c4 with b4 and a4 to 
come and White should still win. 
43.xg7 xa2 44.e5 xg2 45.xg6 Now 
it’s trivial, as the black king is too far from the 
g−pawn and can be cut off from approaching it.

Rook endgames are definitely an area Lee 
should concentrate on in her further studies.
Tan Zhongyi dominated similarly as in the 
Candidates. She had two difficult positions, 
against Krush and Harika, but survived both 
thanks to her usual resourcefulness. On the 
other hand, when she had her chances, she 
took them mercilessly.
Here’s an example where she sacrificed 
material for a somewhat speculative attack, 
but one that worked perfectly thanks to the 
pressure it created on her opponent.

1.e4 e6 The French Defence has been a 
Zatonskih favourite for many years now. 
2.d4 d5 3.c3 f6 4.g5 Several 
decades back, this move was much more 
popular than Steinitz’s 4.e5, which today is 
considered as the main line. Both moves are 
perfectly fine, with the game move offering 
Black a second chance to take on e4. 
4...dxe4 Which Black takes, transposing 
to the Rubinstein variation (usually arising 
after 3...dxe4). The alternatives are 4...e7 
and 4...b4 (the MacCutcheon variation). 
5.xe4 e7 Black can also play 5...bd7. 
6.xf6 xf6 A sharper alternative is 6...
gxf6. 
7.f3 0-0 8.xf6+ Not the most popular 
move and a rather simplistic one. White usually 
chooses from 8.d2, 8.c3, 8.c4 or 8.d3. 
8...xf6 9.d3 c5 Black counterattacks in 
the centre. 
10.dxc5 A risky decision. White wrecks 
her structure and banks on her development 
advantage.

However, after 14.h4 (14.c4 this is

going after 14...h6) 14...h6 White doesn’t

defend, though doesn’t look too pleasant 
for Black;

is very murky, but Black isn’t worse. 
A NEW 
INITIATIVE 
SUPPORTING 
WOMEN’S CHESS 
IN THE US
In 
a 
groundbreaking 
announcement 
at the Cairns Cup, Dr. Jeanne Cairns 
Sinquefield, co−founder of the Saint Louis 
Chess Club, revealed a new initiative 
aimed at supporting the growth of female 
grandmasters in the United States. The 
Cairns Chess Queens Award, a new 
programme designed to encourage more 
U.S. female chess players to achieve the 
prestigious Grandmaster (GM) title, was 
officially launched.
The initiative, beginning on July 4, 2024, will 
award $100,000 to up to five players over the 
next five years who earn the GM title.
This 
substantial 
financial 
incentive 
underscores the commitment to increasing 
female representation in the highest 
echelons of chess, a field where women 
are 
significantly 
underrepresented. 
Currently, only about two percent of 
the more than 2,000 chess grandmasters 
globally are female, and the United States 
boasts just one female player who has 
ever earned the GM title.
“Worldwide there are only 42 female 
GMs, while there are currently more than 
2,000 male GMs. Only 16 countries have 
developed a female GM and the United 
States only has one active female GM,” 
stated Dr. Cairns. “We can do better! We 
challenge the rest of the world to consider 
creating similar programs to develop 
their players so we can create the next 
generation of competitive female players 
and leaders in chess.”

away, it is already looking like it will be a 
great one.

By Grandmaster Raymond Keene OBE
THE CHESS QUEEN OF THE EARLY 1900s:
THE INSPIRATIONAL STORY OF
RHODA A. BOWLES
I recently came across a handsome boxed 
chess set of some historical significance. 
Inscribed on a solid silver plaque, adorning 
the lid, were the words:
To Mrs Rhoda A Bowles, from the 
Cambridge University Chess Club, in 
grateful recognition of her enthusiastic 
and sustained exertions on its behalf in the 
cause of International Chess 1903−1908.
Never having heard of the said Mrs Rhoda 
Bowles, I decided to investigate further, 
and thereby unearthed a remarkable story 
concerning a quasi−forgotten heroine of 
the 64 squares.
The first mention which sprang into 
light came from the vivid pen of Mrs 
Bowles herself, an incident that Mrs 
Bowles later related (as published in the 
“BCM” in 1987):
“Among my earliest chess recollections 
I recall a pathetic scene at Hastings 
during the 1895 Congress. I had just 
arrived from London, and on the stairs 
leading to the hall of play I met poor 
Steinitz, (Wilhelm Steinitz , world chess 
champion from 1866−1894) who upon 
seeing me, burst into tears and said, 
“Oh, Madam Bowles what shall I do?” 
he said. “I have just lost my game to 
Lasker, and that is my fourth successive 
loss, I shall never win again. Even my 
own pupil, young Pillsbury, has beaten 
me and I cannot sleep at night; for three 
nights have I tossed and tumbled, but 
sleep is denied me, I am utterly broken 
down.” And he wept. I felt a big lump in 
my throat, but I tried to cheer him, and 
begged him to go home and go to bed, 
even if he could not sleep. He thanked 
me, but went away with a sad heart, 
promising, however, to take my advice. 
I was up betimes the next morning, and 
when he entered the hall I was waiting 
with a buttonhole, which I pinned in his 
coat, telling him that I had come to turn 
his luck, and should expect him to win 
that day.“
Steinitz then went on to beat Curt von 
Bardeleben, in perhaps the most celebrated 
game of his entire illustrious career.

And Black resigned at this point. As Steinitz 
demonstrated 
immediately 
afterwards, 
there is a mate in ten moves which can 
only be averted by ruinous loss of material;

Further research excavated the following facts 
based on sources of the day and especially the 
highly informative British Chess Magazine 
(BCM). In the 1890s, women’s chess in 
England, as in most places, was considered 
nearly inconsequential. To bring this arena to 
the forefront required dedication, energy and 
persistence. It so happened that many of the 
women who had those requirements and were 
willing to apply them towards chess also had 
blood relatives or husbands who were also 
devoted to the game.
One of the most energetic, dedicated, 
persistent and effective promoters of 
women’s chess in England during its 
infancy, was Mrs. Rhoda A. Bowles. 
Rhoda Annie Knott of Dawlish, a small 
town in Devon, married Henry Lewis 
Bowles, a strong chess player from nearby 
Exeter. While Rhoda wasn’t a chess−player 
at the time, when she came down with an 
illness that left her temporarily blinded, 
her husband taught her to play the game 
by touch. Rhoda Bowles soon became one 
of the stronger woman players in England. 
More importantly, she became one of the 
most active promoters of women’s chess. In 
January of 1895 she, with a group of other 
ladies, formed the British Ladies’ Chess 
Club of London. In 1896, she started acting 
on her idea for a women’s international 
tournament. She found support, backers 
and competitors (see the competitors’ 
photo above) from all over for the Ladies’ 
1st International Tournament held in 1897.
Ada S. Ballin enlisted her to write the chess 
column for her new illustrated monthly, 
Womanhood. Launched in December 1898, 
this was a magazine of exceptional quality 
that catered for intelligent, informed and 
independent−minded women. The chess 
column was, indeed, of a high standard. It 
seems that the magazine folded around 1906. 
After that, Mrs Bowles contributed some 
articles for The Chess Amateur, launched in 
October 1906. The British Chess Magazine 
tells us about a living chess game in 1903 
between the strong English player, Henry 
Lewis Bowles, and the American champion 
and victor of Hastings 1895, Harry Nelson 
Pillsbury. Bowles, better known as H.L. 
Bowles, was the husband of Rhoda Bowles.
An eye witness report follows: “A highly−
successful exhibition of Living Chess was 
given at the Borough Road Polytechnic, 
London, on Saturday, November 29th. 
The proceedings were started by young 
men of the gymnasium, who, to military 
drill, plaited the board with alternate strips 
of crimson and white material. This was

followed by the entrance of the living pieces, 
who advanced one at a time on either side 
of the board to their respective places, being 
accompanied by appropriate selections on 
the pianoforte by Dr Elwyn Lewis, hon. 
sec. Kent County Chess Association. The 
costumes and mounting of the pieces were 
highly creditable to Messrs. C & W. May, 
who supervised this part of the arrangements. 
Particularly conspicuous were the two 
Queens. Mrs. H. N. Pillsbury represented 
the Black Queen in crimson velvet and gold, 
and Mrs. Rhoda A. Bowles the White Queen 
resplendent in silver and gold.”
It seems that the great Pillsbury, who 
dominated the strongest tournament ever 
staged until that time, Hastings 1895, was 
a loyal supporter of Rhoda Bowles, and 
performed everything within his powers 
to endorse and magnify her efforts to 
promote chess. Rhoda was born in 1861 
and died in 1931. The 1932 issue of the 
BCM had this to say:
The Metropolitan Chess Club has sustained 
a heavy loss by the death early in December 
of Mrs. Rhoda Bowles. She had been a 
vice−president and staunch supporter of the 
club for a generation. At one time she was 
secretary of the Ladies’ Chess Club, and 
ran a successful and informative column 
in “Womanhood”. A great organiser, she 
ran the Ladies’ International Tournament 
of 1897, and together with her husband, 
the late H.L. Bowles, conducted a series of 
matches between the English and American 
Universities. It was, in fact, her husband 
who taught her chess, in the course of a 
long illness. In June last she was involved 
in a serious motor accident, and her death 
must be attributed to injuries then received. 
The BCM gave another account of Mrs. 
Bowles in 1900: “Mrs. Rhoda A. Bowles.—
Among the new chess columns we have 
received during the past year, that started 
in Womanhood, in February last, is now 
always certain of hearty welcome to our 
table; not only on account of the literally 
ability of its conductor, but also because of 
her charming personality and the influence 
for good she wields in the London chess 
world. Mrs. Rhoda A. Bowles or, ”Little 
Mother,” as she is affectionately called 
by her intimate chess friends, has, in the 
short space of four years, compiled such 
a remarkable record as an organiser that 
we take special pleasure in referring to her 
achievements in the pages of the “B.C.M.” 
All well informed chess votaries know that 
Mrs. Bowles is the life and soul of the now 
famous Ladies’ Chess Club, but few know 
how she became acquainted with chess. The 
Ada S. Ballin got Rhoda A Bowles to write a chess column for the
illustrated monthly, Womanhood, that appeared in December 1898

story is a pretty one. Mrs. Bowles tells us 
that it was entirely through her husband’s 
love of chess that she, under his tuition, 
learnt to play. At tennis, billiards, &c., they 
could play together. Chess she deemed 
quite beyond a woman’s powers; but nature 
subsequently came to her aid. After a few 
years of married life she was seized with 
a terrible illness, and was almost blind for 
three weeks, during which period I had, she 
says,—to be amused in some way. “My dear 
husband read to me until I tired of that, then 
the brilliant idea struck him that he might 
teach me the ‘ names’ of the chess pieces 
by ‘touch’—for my eyes were bandaged 
night and day—this interested me greatly, 
and by the time that I had learnt the names 
and how to move the pieces, the shield 
could be lifted from my eyes sufficiently 
for me to see the 64 squares, and by the 
time of my convalescence I could move 
each piece correctly.
“Then came my eagerness to play a game! 
Oh the pleasure of it! No woman can 
realize until she has faced her husband 
on what she thinks the highest pinnacle 
beyond her. Of course I never stood a 
chance of winning, but the pleasure was to 
be in the same ‘running’; to try, now that I 
was on the track, to perfect my speed—in 
other words play—until I could catch him 
up. I haven’t done this yet, but I sometimes 
trap him, and have the pleasure of hearing 
him say ‘well−played’.”
After her recovery Mrs. Bowles became 
one of a coterie of ladies who met every 
week at each others houses to play chess; 
but finding there was a natural feeling of 
diffidence to this system Mrs. Bowles 
advocated, and was chiefly instrumental in 
securing, a small room at Charing Cross. 
Lady Newnes was invited to become 
president, and gladly consented; Mrs. 
Bowles was the first match captain and 
tournament secretary of the club, and 
was shortly after elected secretary and 
treasurer, and here, with the modest annual 
subscription of 5/−, was practically started 
the now famous Ladies’ Chess Club. The 
esprit de corps now manifest in the club 
could be traced largely to the indefatigable 
energy and exceptional organising powers 
of Mrs. Bowles, whose efforts were so 
highly appreciated by her fellow members 
that they presented to her in 1896 a beautiful 
writing table as a slight token of regard. By 
this time the club membership had risen to 
over 100, and yet the ambition of the “Little 
Mother” was not satisfied.
She had long thought that an International 
Tournament for Ladies would be a fitting 
event to be held during the Diamond 
Jubilee year of our Queen’s (Queen 
Victoria’s) reign. Indeed so far back as 
Whitsuntide, 1896, Mrs. Bowles had 
sought the opinion of several influential 
friends, whose encouragement was further 
emphasised by Sir George Newnes, who 
generously gave £60 for the first prize. The 
tournament was played in London; lasted a 
fortnight, from June 23rd, 1897, and proved 
a huge success—no less than 20 Ladies 
from all parts of the world competing for 
the prizes—the aggregate value of which 
amounted to some £250!

The competitors came from Canada, New 
York, Germany, France, &c. Miss Rudge 
(England) proved to be the champion player 
and took first prize. Mrs. Worrall took the 
fourth prize to America, and received a 
great ovation. After the tournament the 
competitors marked their indebtedness 
to Mrs. Bowles by giving her a beautiful 
gold bracelet, with a gold chess Queen as 
pendant. We have long held the opinion that 
the officials of chess clubs devote too little 
attention to the social side of the game; and 
the wonderful successes achieved by Mrs. 
Bowles confirm our opinions.
Every year the birthday of the Ladies’ Club 
is honoured at a delightful re−union party, 
the fifth of which was given last month. 
We also learn from the February issue of 
Womanhood that the new quarters lent 
themselves capitally for the occasion, and 
the brightness of the rooms was enhanced 
by the scarlet and white (the Ladies’ Chess 
Club colours) of the beautiful flowers 
which were prettily arranged about them.
The gold medal, which was given as a 
brilliancy prize by the Ladies’ Chess Club, 
and won by Herr Lasker in the recent ( 
1899) London International Tournament, 
fully inscribed with the winner’s name, was 
handed around for his many admirers to see 
before posting it off to Herr Lasker, who is 
at present in Berlin.
We congratulate Mrs. Bowles most heartily 
on the success which has attended her 
efforts on behalf of the club for which she 
has done so much, and we hope that the 
members will continue to enjoy, for many 
years to come, the pleasures which arise 
from her arduous labours in their behalf.”
Meanwhile, we read from the BCM, 
1902: “On March 26th the Cambridge 
University Chess Club concluded its 
annual Metropolitan chess tour with the 
return match against a team of ladies, 
captained by Mrs. Rhoda Bowles, chess 
editor of Womanhood. At the call of time 
the unfinished games were adjudicated by 
Mr. Pillsbury, who then gave the assembled 
company several remarkable illustrations 
of his mental powers. The first illustration 
was the placing of a Knight upon any of the 
squares of the chessboard that the company 
might select, and then, without sight of the 
board, Mr. Pillsbury rapidly dictated move 
after move by which the Knight, without 
covering any one square twice, covered 
each one of the sixty−four squares in turn. 
In the next illustration a pack of cards 
was shuffled and about twenty dealt out, 
each card being called. Mr. Pillsbury not 
seeing the cards simply listened, and then 
rapidly and accurately called off all the 
remaining cards that had not been dealt. 
Then a list of thirty words and names, 
some of them most fantastic, were written 
down by the company, and after the list 
had been read over he answered correctly 
all enquiries as to what name appeared 
against particular numbers and vice versa, 
and then in conclusion gave the whole list 
backwards in proper order. These feats 
were all accomplished by memorising 
efforts alone, and bear striking testimony to 
the remarkable development of his mental 
powers, which have already become world−
famous by his successful achievement of 
twenty games of chess played sans voir.”
In its review of the 1897 Ladies’ International 
Chess Congress, the BCM wrote:
“Mrs. Bowles (hon. sec. of the Ladies’ 
Chess Club) has rendered a great service 
to the cause of chess by organising this 
splendid Tournament. It is less than five 
years ago that enforced leisure, consequent 
upon the recovering from an illness, 
afforded her the opportunity of learning 
the moves of chess, and having mastered 
the elementary principles , she became at 
once a great enthusiast of the game. She 
joined the Ladies’ Chess Club, then newly 
formed, and at once took an active part 
in its development. For the past two years 
she has been either its match captain, 
its secretary, or its treasurer, occupying 
indeed all three positions for the last twelve 
months. The members of the club are so 
perfectly satisfied with her labours on their

07/144
   | BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE
426
behalf that they have left her no alternative 
but to continue her work, though the task is 
almost beyond her strength. 
We have already referred to her inception 
of the idea of a Jubilee International Ladies’ 
Tournament, but the amount of work she has 
got through in carrying her idea into effect is 
simply prodigious. Not less than 2,000 letters 
have been written by her own hand during 
the last twelve months in connection with the 
Tournament, and this in addition to her other 
chess work. She is full of good chess ideas, 
and has played many bright games, but her 
opportunities for actual play are restricted, 
owing to the pressure of her chess work 
in organising and managing the club and 
the Tournament. We heartily congratulate 
Mrs. Bowles on the success of her spirited 
endeavours to prove that women can play 
chess. We delight in every forward movement 
of the game, and we are sure that the arousing 
of feminine interest in chess will tend to keep 
many a male chess votary true to his love for 
the game, who under other circumstances 
might have passed out of the ranks.
The Tournament has been held, it has been a 
success, and it marks an epoch in the game, 
and we dare to say will not be the last of its 
kind. In planning, organising, and carrying 
out this unique chess tournament, Mrs. 
Bowles has done a good service to the game.”

Bowles lively style of play:

Here is the record of Rhoda Bowles’ 
supreme organisational triumph:
FIRST INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT FOR LADIES, LONDON, 1897

07/144
   | BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE
428
Although Vera Menchik is officially credited 
as the first women’s world chess champion, 
in a title dating to the 1920’s, it is completely 
clear to me that London 1897 should be 
recognised as the first such championship. 
Furthermore, the organisational exertions 
of Rhoda Bowles should be honoured and 
Mary Rudge acknowledged as the first 
women’s world champion. Similarly the 
overall championship officially continues 
to exclude such obvious wielders of the 
global sceptre as Philidor, Labourdonnais, 
Staunton, Anderssen, Morphy, while failing 
to recognise the claims of Steinitz going 
back to 1866, as he himself claimed. The 
time has come to set the record right.
I am indebted to my sister, the historian 
Professor Jackie Eales, who published the 
following extract in BCM.
The 1897 tournament excited both a great 
deal of interest and a great deal of initial 
criticism. Staunch adversaries of women’s 
chess suggested that the tournament would 
be a farce, not merely because of the lower 
standard of play amongst women, but also 
because the players would collapse with 
“nervous strain” at having to play two 
rounds a day for ten days.
The “nervous strain” argument was of 
course a well−known jibe trotted out by 
Victorian paternalists whenever women 
showed any sign of climbing out of their 
crinolines and attempting to challenge the 
established order of male superiority. In the 
1870s the very same argument had been 
used against women sitting for university 
exams, on the grounds that the strain would 
result in a breakdown in the health of the 
aspiring female graduates.
Despite the antagonism engendered by 
the idea, the Secretary of the London 
Club, Rhoda Bowles, persevered with the 
organisation of the tournament, which 
attracted twenty entries, representing 
Canada, the United States, Germany, 
Italy, Belgium, France England, Ireland 
and Scotland.
The organisation of this tournament 
marked a changing point in women’s 
chess; thereafter women’s tournaments and 
championships became an accepted feature 
of chess life.
The increased acceptance of women’s 
participation in organised chess was 
the result of the efforts of the women 
themselves and a number of individual 
Victorian players and problemists deserve 
greater attention.
Mary Rudge (6 February 1845 - December 
1919), the winner of the London 1897 
tournament, was one of the first women to 
take up chess as a competitive sport. She 
started playing at the Counties Congress 
in 1874, when she took second place in 
the Class II competition. By 1878 she had 
earned the reputation of being the best 
woman player in England, although she 
never progressed past the point of being 
a strong second class player. The greatest 
success of Mary Rudge’s chess playing 
career was undoubtedly her victory at 
the 1897 tournament, but only highlights 
of her games in this tournament were 
published in BCM of that year, who waited 
for her opponents to make mistakes which 
she exploited methodically.
The runner−up to Mary Rudge in 
the London 1897 tournament was L. 
Mathilda Fagan (9 January 1850 - 11 
August 1931). She was unusual among 
women chess players of the Victorian 
era because she was one of the very 
few who was active in the women’s 
emancipation movement. In 1875 a 
number of her problems appeared in 
the City of London Chess Magazine 
under her nom de plume of ‘Deesa’. In 
1882 she won the Chess Tournament of 
the Bombay Sports Club, although she 
was very nearly disqualified before 
the tournament started because she
was a woman.
And for the following, we are indebted 
to GM Susan Polgar, from her comments

online via X, formerly Twitter. It is 
astonishing to see that the prejudice which 
was alive and well in 1882 in Bombay, 
was still flourishing in Budapest over a 
century later.
Between April and May of 1986, I 
participated in the Hungarian National 
Championship in Budapest. Going into 
the tournament, all participants were 
told the rules, and that the top 3 finishers 
would qualify to play in the “Men’s” 
World Championship Zonal Tournament. 
I had just turned 17 right before the 
tournament and until then, people would 
not even think about a woman qualifying 
for the “Men’s” World Championship.
But I was brought up differently by 
my parents. I was taught that I could 
accomplish anything I want if I put in the 
hard work. I had put in a lot of hard work 
since I had been 4 or 5. Unfortunately, I 
was not told that as a young woman and 
Jew, I would be black−listed. By the time 
my younger sisters had begun to play 
serious chess, my battles had cleared the 
way for them.
The unexpected of course happened. 
Knowing that I needed to finish in 
the top 3 to achieve the unthinkable, I 
paced myself to accomplish just that. 
I finished tied for 2nd with IM Laszlo 
Hazai, 
behind 
Grandmaster 
Ivan 
Farago. I was very happy of what I have 
accomplished. I had qualified for the 
“Men’s World Chess Championship” 
cycle. But the happy moment quickly 
turned sour. Many people were not 
happy. The Hungarian Chess Federation 
changed the rules and announced 
that only the top two would represent 
Hungary instead of the top three.
No problem, I said to myself. So we 
will have a play−off between IM Hazai 
and me and the winner will move on. 
Wrong! The decision was made. Susan 
Polgar is not going to the “Men’s World 
Championship” cycle no matter what. IM 
Hazai will represent Hungary and that 
was final.
After I legitimately qualified and broke 
the gender barrier, I learned rules can 
be changed at any time (especially if you 
are a young Jewish woman). To add more 
insult to injury, FIDE  also refused to allow 
me to participate in the “Men’s World 
Championship” Zonal tournament. The 
reason? The word “Men’s Championship” 
speaks for itself.
Dr Laszlo Lako of Hungary stated that he 
would not allow Susan Polgar or any other 
Hungarian women to play in the “Men’s 
World 
Chess 
Championship” 
Zonal 
tournament even if FIDE would have agreed 
to let me play. The Hungarian federation 
and FIDE succeeded in stopping me from 
participating even though I had earned my 
spot. However, they could not stop women 
forever. They had to eventually change the 
name to the World Chess Championship in 
the following cycle and the word ‘Men’ was 
FINALLY removed.
Fortunately, my loss was a gain for 
women in chess. Now, all women can 
compete in the overall World Chess 
Championship. 
Someday, 
hopefully 
another woman can break through the 
next barrier and win it all. But in the 
meantime, I am very proud to be able 
to chisel through the wall of gender 
discrimination in chess for future 
generations. I am happy to see so many 
good women players from around the 
world. I hope this trend will continue.“
Here, as a postscript, is a much more 
recent female triumph over Grandmaster 
Mickey Adams, who seldom loses a game 
against anyone: Nurgyul Salimova vs. 
Michael Adams.

Openings
    for Amateurs By Pete Tamburro; ptamburro@aol.com 
Attacking patterns 
out of your Openings
(Part III)
This game reminds us of two fundamental 
principles. One is the necessity for learning 
the basic technical knowledge of chess: 
rook and pawn endings, king and pawn 
endings, techniques for winning material, 
attacking a king that castled, attacking 
a king that isn’t castled, etc. The other 
principle is that you must, at the board, 
have a thinking process routine on every 
move so you don’t overlook opportunities 
when they arise − for you or your opponent. 
These two players are masters. One missed 
a fatal attacking move that if you gave 
him as a position and said, "Black to Play 
and Win," he would have found it. A little 
research revealed it was even worse than 
that! However, there is nobody whispering 
that in your ear during a game. You have to 
be aware of those possibilities for whatever 
opening you study. Take a look...

This 
modest,

move 
contains a threat to win the game! If you 
have the White pieces, you have to be

position and initiated a threat?

White misses the threat. It’s a very old theme 
(xf2/f7+ before the king is castled) and 
yet it’s missed by a master. There were two 
ways to avoid the carnage that follows: 9.f3 
e6 10.b5 0-0 11.xc6 bxc6 12.e2 a5

xc4 11.xc4 e6 12.e2=.
9...xe4!! Of the TEN games in the 
database only one other person other than 
Ruck found xe4! The favourite was 9...
g5. This goes back to basic chess lessons 
for beginners, and yet a 2200 and a 2500 
ignored rule number one: on every move 
look at all checks, captures and forced 
moves...and f2 (or f7) of all places when 
there’s an uncastled king.

12...e5+!! The only move for Black and 
yet the winning move. Black demonstrates 
the key understanding in this type of 
position: get the hunted king up the board 
and into the open. Please note that this is a 
minor piece attack! 
13.xe4 f5+ Also forced and yet forcing. 
The aspiring student should go back to the 
Nxe4 diagram and figure the whole line out 
in your brain. 
14.d5 Cute is 14.f4 g6#.
14...xd8 15.xg4 c6+ 16.e6 0-0!! 
Sure, you can take the queen, but you don’t 
have to! Calmly castling testifies to the 
overwhelming Black position. It must have 
been fun to play. 
17.d5 The game is over as even escaping 
with the queen ends badly for her husband. 
17.e2 f6+ 18.e7 d7+ 19.e8 f8#.
17...fxg4 18.d3 g6 Wants to eliminate 
f5 as an escape square so Black can play 
fe8; however, de8+ would lead to 
forced mate. Check it out.

25.d3 e5+ 26.c3 f2 OK, White has 
had enough − finally!

This game is such a perfect lesson for all of 
us. On every move of every game, we have 
to pay attention. We have to go through a 
thinking routine. When I put 20 ways to raise 
your rating without studying the openings in 
Openings for Amateurs − Next Steps, I would 
be happy if amateurs just went through the first 
four, because I see so many amateur games 
decided by not considering these check offs.
White in our game didn’t consider the sacrifice 
on f2. If you recall all those Nimzoindian traps 
I covered in the March 2020 BCM, you might 
remember the title: It also might help amateurs 
to completely review Renaud and Kahn’s 
Art of the Checkmate or a comprehensive 
tactics book that teaches the theme ideas for 
the tactics in the book. And, when you study 
the various openings in your repertoire, you 
should be aware of the attacking possibilities 
for both sides in the evolving positions.

Endgame Studies

July 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 445
This month’s studies celebrate John Beasley, who died in March. He was the Grand Old 
Man of the British endgame study, but his range of skills was extraordinarily wide and in 
particular he was a puzzle polymath. In the 19th century, the title "Puzzle King" was given 
to the American Sam Loyd. In recent years, we might have bestowed it on John Beasley, 
but I think he would have preferred a less bombastic version, so perhaps we can call him 
the Puzzle King of Britain.
I reviewed his book ’A Book of Bedtime Pawn Endings’ in this column in February. In his 
habitually modest manner, he only included one of his own compositions in the book, so 
to do more justice to his compositional skill, here are four, starting with the pleasant 1990 
study from The Problemist. The second, also from The Problemist but from 2007, shows 
what John named an "ultimate reciprocal zugzwang" meaning whoever is to play has to 
allow mate in one. The third is a joint composition with the other great figure of the British 
endgame study, John Roycroft. The fourth study was composed by him for use in the 1994 
World Chess Solving Championship, for which he was the Director.
John composed very many types of puzzle. Perhaps my favourite is not a chess composition, 
but a double dummy bridge problem. You can find the details in John’s book ’51 Flights 
of Chess Fancy and a few other frolics’. Declarer makes three no trumps against any 
defence − routine stuff, it seems. Yes, but in this arrangement of the cards, whichever of the 
four players is declarer makes 3NT. It is scarcely credible that such an arrangement exists. 
You’ll find some of John’s studies, and many of his puzzles, at jsbeasley.co.uk; there are 
more at arves.org where there are also details of his books.
The answers to the four studies are on page 
The solutions are on page 447.

Solutions to Problems
A (fairly) easy starter
In Kabe’s problem there are two tries to 
consider. If White plays 1.ׇf5, he is not 
threatening mate next move, but it appears 
that Black may be in zugzwang, for now 
1…׆e3 would be met by 2.ׇxd6#, 1…׆xb4 
by 2.ׇd4# and either move of the b3 pawn 
by 2.׆xa4# − but there is no mating response 
if Black makes either of the two available 
moves of the b1 knight. Another zugzwang 
attempt is 1.ׇc4. Now those moves of the 
b1 knight allow 2.ׇxa3#, and we still have 
1…׆e3/b2[/bxa2] 2.ׇxd6/׆xa4#, but it’s 
now 1…׆xb4! that thwarts White. The key 
is 1.׆e2!, still with no threat, but setting 
up a royal battery that proves mightily 
effective as Black tries to find an innocuous 
move - 1…׆d4(׆xb4) 2.׃(x)d4#; 1…ׇc3 
2.׃xc3#; 1…ׇd2 2.׃xd2#; 1…b2(bxa2) 
2.׃c2 and 1…׆xe3 2.׃xe3#. A fine feature 
of this construction is that the white bishop 
had been fulfilling a significant role at d1 
discouraging moves by the b3 pawn. For 
moves by that pawn, as well as for other 
possible black moves (notably 1…׆xb4 
and moves by the knight from b1) there are 
nicely changed mates.
Provoked checks…
… is the composers’ heading for our 
second problem. To threaten mate on move 
three, it is necessary to bring the white 
king closer to its black counterpart; but 
it seems that 1.׃f7 (threatening 2.ׅf6+ 
2…׃g5/׃e5 3.ׇxe4/ׅxe4#) must fail to 
pre−emptive moves by the black king, 
which throw a spanner in the works by 
firing a battery from the f4 rook. At this 
point, a savvy solver might sense that this 
line is indeed the solution, because walking 
the white king into a battery, provoking 
checks, is exactly the sort of paradoxical 
play celebrated by problemists. And indeed 
upon closer inspection, it is revealed that 
each of the black king moves (which are 
Black’s only defences) walks into a pin, and 
with the f4 rook thus immobilized we have 
the continuations 1…׃g5+ 2.׃e6! (threat 
3.ׇxe4) 2…h4 3.ׄxg4# and 1…׃e5+ 
2.׃xg6! (threat 3.ׅxe4) 2…׃xd5 3.ׅ4c5#. 
The position may look rather heavy, but 
is, I think, surprisingly light considering 
the difficulty of the paradoxical task the 
composers had set themselves. It is probably 
good that Black has defences on move two 
(…h4/ …׃xd5), as there can be a sense of 
being ‘short−changed’ by a variation that 
simply ends with “and Black can’t stop the 
threatened mate”. It also has the good effect 
of getting some positive mileage out of the 
white queen and the a2 bishop.
Precision required
In Udo’s problem, it is no surprise that the 
black king will be mated in the corner, but 
it transpires that great accuracy is needed 
in order to force mate on move seven. We 
start with 1.ׇd4 ׃b1 (for as long as possible 
Black avoids playing …bxc3; here it would 
lose in short order: 2.ׇa3 c2 3.ׇ4xc2#) 
2.ׇe2 ׃a1 (after 2…bxc3 we get to ׇ4xc2# 
on move 5) 3.ׇe3 ׃b1 (here, if Black plays 
3…bxc3 play will rejoin the main line) 
4.ׇc2 bxc3 (at last!) 5.ׇa3+ ׃a1 6.ׇd4 c2 
7.ׇ4xc2#.
This month’s originals
We are always glad to welcome new names to this column, and it is a pleasure this month 
to include offerings from Sergey Tkachenko and Udo Marks.
In a balanced set of problems, I think (and hope) that the first and last will come in 
the ‘easy and enjoyable’ category, the middle two requiring more cerebral effort, albeit 
hopefully retaining the ‘enjoyable’ tag when the solution is either found or else read in 
the following text.

One of Ljubomir’s 
easier helpmates
I always have a slight reservation when a 
solver comments “nice, but easy”. It’s that 
word “but” that very slightly worries me 
- it seems to imply that the quality of a 
chess problem is inextricably linked to its 
difficulty as a puzzle. I’m a fan of difficult 
helpmates, but also enjoy the pleasure of 
discovering (easily) a profusion of related 
solutions, such as our eminent Slovenian 
contributor provides in creating seven 
variations on the same theme here. Such 
problems also have the good function of 
encouraging readers to have a go at solving, 
and so kudos if you saw all or most of 
these solutions (remember: in helpmate 
solutions the collaborative move sequences 
are initiated by Black) - 1.׆h4 ׅxh6 2.׈g5 
ׅa6#; 1.ׅh1 ׅxh1 2.ׇf2 ׅa1#; 1.ׅh2 ׅxh2 
2.c1=ׅ ׅa2#;
1.ׅh3 ׅxh3 2.e2 ׅa3#;
1.ׅh4 ׅxh4 2.f3 ׅa4#; 1.ׅh5 ׅxh5 2.e4 
ׅa5#;
And 1.ׅg8+ ׃xg8 2.e6 ׄb7#. (That final 
solution, ‘the same but different’, seems to 
me to be an important ‘grace note’.)

it is the player that is trying to win who 
gives the perpetual check.
There are various White tries on moves 
one, two and three:1.b6? c8 2.f7+ 
f8: 2.xa6? c8+ 3.b6 f8;
2.f6+? xg6 3.b6 c8 4.f8 xf8

1.a8+ b8 2.a1 g1 3.xg1 xg1 
4.e4 g5 5.f5+ d8 6.g4 draws. White’s 
king can prevent the Black king escaping from 
the top right−hand corner. Why was it necessary 
to insert 1.a8+ before a1? It forced the 
Black bishop to occupy the b8 square; without 
that, the Black king would have been able to 
respond to f5+ with ...b8 and extract itself 
from the prison by going the long way round. 
When he composed this for the World Chess 
Solving Championship, John was hoping that 
some of the top solvers would not notice that 
nuance. They did, though, or rather if they 
weren’t sure which of the two first moves was 
the right one, they opted for 1.a8+ because 
it looked more study−like than the try 1.a1? 
Strong solvers are annoying like that. Anyway, 
it was a nice try by John.

ANALYSIS  OF  THE  DECOMPOS I T I ON  OF  TRANSPARENT  POLYMER  MATERIALS 
(BLOCKS)  UNDER  THE  ACTION  OF  LASER  BEAMS  IN  FREE  GENERATION  MODE. 

M.  A.  Sultanov,  B.  N.  Narzullayev,  V.  Urunov. 

(Presented  by  academician  of  AS  of  Tadzhik  SSR  0.  V.  Dobrovol 'skiy  9 
June  1969). 

Yn  the  literatures  in  es  sen  centra  s  investigated  mechanism  of 
decomposition  of  transparent  blocks  depending  on  power  of  generation, 
on  number  of  pulses/momenta,  on  focal  length  of  lens  and  so  forth  on 
ruby  and  neodymium  lasers  both  in  regime/conditions  of  free  generation 
and  in  regime/conditions  of  giant  pulse/momentum.  However,  the 
mechanism  of  the  decomposition  of  the  materials  indicated  under  the 

action  of  laser  beams  by  the  different  authors  is  explained  - 

- - - -  -  .  - 

differently*  for  example,  the  authors  of  work  [1]  assume  that  the 
basic  reason  for  the  decomposition  of  transparent  materials  under  the 
effect  of  laser  radiation  is  the  propagation  of  the  acoustic  waves, 
formed  as  a  result  of  the  forced  combination  scattering  of 
Mandelstam-Brillouin  -  VKRMB.  To  the  same  opinion  adhere  the  authors 
of  works  [2,  3],  but  in  [4,  5]  by  the  authors  is  proposed  the 
mechanism  of  decomposition,  which  occurs  due  to  the  local  heating  of 
substance  in  the  focus  of  ray/beam  and  formation  of  the  foci  of  the 
high  temperature,  in  consequence  of  which  appear  the  dynamic  stresses, 
which  will  lead  to  the  shift  effects.  In  [4]  was  also  indicated  the 
formation  of  the  gas  pockets  in  the  material  and  of  cracks  in  the  form

of  the  "plates",  arranged/located  at  an  angle  of  45°  with  respect  to 
the  direction  of  laser  beam  [63.  However,  in  [7]  it  is  noted  that 
crack  formation  in  PMMA  [flMfyA  -  polymethyl  methacrylate]  is  the  result 

of  the  propagation  of  cross  and  longitudinal  hypersonic  waves.

From  examination  of  literature  data  it  is  evident  that 'tmity  of 
opinion  to  mechanism  of  decomposition  of  transparent  materials 
(blocks)  under  effect  of  coherent  emission  at  the  present  time  still 
is  absent.  j»ome  experimental  results^,  obtained  by  the 

authors  of  this  work"i£h^the~ effect/action  of  supersonic  plasma  jets  on 
different  polymeric  materials,  showed  that  in  the  mechanism  of 
decomposition  the  dominant  role  play«i*thermal  effects,  of  [8). 

Therefore  it  was  of  interest  to  check  this  assumption  in  the  case  of 
the  effect  of  laser  emission  on  the  polymeric  materials.  For  this 
purpose  two  laser  installations  on  the  glass  with  neodymium  were 
assembled. N  Work  was  conducted  in  the  regime/conditions  of  free 
generation.  The  sizes/dimensions  of  crystals  comprised  12x120  and 
12x140  mm  respectively,  time  of  generation  -  approximately  500  ms,  the 

diameter  of  spot  in  the  focus  of  ray/beam  -  on  the  order  of  0.1  mm.

Energy  of  generation  on  the  installation  was  changed  from  10  to  20 
joules,

methacrylate  -  PMMA,  quartz,  glass,  polystyrene  in  dependence  on  focal

The  common  picture  of  the  decomposition  of  transparent  materials 
(PMMA,  polystyrene)  under  the  effect/action  of  laser  beams  in  the 
regime/conditions  of  free  generation  appears  as  follows. 

With  focusing  of  laser  beam  in  PMMA,  polystyrene  materials  are 
subjected  to  intensive  decomposition,  moreover  decomposition  is 
accompanied  by  formation  of  flat/plane,  elongated  cracks  in  the  form 
of  "plates"  of  different  sizes/dimensions,  arranged/located  at 
different  angles  of  inclination/slope  relative  to  axis  of  light  ray. 

In  this  case  the  cracks  are  asymmetrically  displaced  to  the  different 
sides  from  the  axis  of  ray/beam  and,  as  a  rule,  i.e  strongly  charred 
(especially  in  the  polystyrene). 

1.  Investigation  of  picture  of  decomposition  of  transparent 
materials  in  dependence  on  focal  length  of  lens.  For  this  were  used 
the  lens  with  focal  length  of  33.75  and  150  mm. 

Analysis  of  pictures  of  decomposition  with  this  experimental 
variant  shows  that  with  increase  in  focal  length  of  lens  overall 
length  of  damage/defeat  by  light  ray  is  increased.  In  this  case  the 
sizes/dimensions  of  cracks  decrease  along  the  diameter;  however,  their 
number  is  increased  per  unit  of  the  length  of  ray/beam.  A  change  in 


DOC  -  87064600 


PAGE 


4 

the  focal  length  affects  also  the  angle  of  the  slope  of  "plates"  with 
respect  to  the  axis  of  ray/beam.  With  an  increase  in  the  focal  length 
the  angle  of  the  slope  of  cracks  decreases. 

Analysis  of  one  of  pictures  of  decomposition  of  PMMA  under 
effect/action  of  laser  beam  with  focal  length  of  lens,  equal  to  150 
mm,  and  energy  of  output/yield,  equal  to  10  joules,  shows  following. 

Overall  length  of  decomposition  on  light  ray  comprises  more  than 
30  mm.  In  the  work  entire  picture  of  decomposition  was  divided  in 
three  sections  (on  one  centimeter)  and  was  calculated  a  quantity  of 
cracks  for  each  of  them.  In  this  case  it  was  explained  that  a  number 
of  cracks  at  a  distance  of  10  mm  from  the  place  of  focus  on  the  course 
of  ray  composes  100-110,  the  maximum/overall  diameter  of  crack  in  this 
case  having  sizes/dimensions  to  5  mm,  minimum  -  0.005  mm.  In  the 
following  section  a  number  of  cracks  composes  160-170?  maximum/overall 
diameter  -  to  3  mm,  minimum  -  0.004  mm.  In  the  latter/last  section  a 
number  of  cracks  -  90 — 100?  max imum/ove rail  diameter  -  to  2  mm, 
minimum  -  0.004  mm. 

As  can  be  seen  from  analysis  of  this  picture,  with  removal  of 
ray/beam  from  place  of  focusing,  dimensions  of  cracks  decrease.  The 
greatest  number  of  cracks  falls  in  the  middle  section  of  the  region  of 
decomposition. 


2.  Study  of  form  of  fracture  of  PMMA  and  glass  depending  on

place  of  focusing.  Laser  beam  with  the  aid  of  the  lens  with  a  focal 
length  of  33  mm  was  focused  on  the  front  surface,  in  the  volume  and  on 
the  rear  surface  of  material.  Experimental  results  are  shown: 

a)  with  the  focusing  of  ray/beam  on  the  front  surface  is  observed 
the  formation  of  large  "plates"  in  the  focus  ( PMMA) ,  and  also  chipping 
of  material  (glass),  as  a  result  of  which  occurs  cratering,  whose 
size/dimension  depends  on  the  power  of  generation  and  focal  length  of 
lens; 

b)  with  the  focusing  of  ray/beam  within  the  material 
decomposition  is  observed  both  to  the  place  of  beam  convergence  and 
after  it.  However,  to  the  place  of  beam  convergence  a  number  of 
cracks  is  less  than  after  the  focus.  In  the  place  of  focusing  is 
observed  the  presence  of  many  cracks,  situated  also  at  different 
angles  both  with  respect  to  the  axis  of  ray/beam,  and  according  to  the 
relation  the  friend  and  the  friend; 

c)  with  focusing  of  ray/beam  nearer  to  back  edge  of  sample  is 
formed  one  large  "plate",  then  the  formation  of  other  cracks  both  in 
the  beam  direction  and  it  is  perpendicular  to  it,  i.e.,  the  part  of 
the  ray/beam  changes  its  direction  with  respect  to  the  original  at 
angle  of  90°. 

Page  14. 

With  the  low  values  of  energy  of  the  ray/beam  (less  than  10  joules)  it 
appears  the  additional  decomposition,  caused  by  the  reflection  of 
laser  beam  from  the  separate  cracks,  whose  axes  are  directed 
approximately  at  different  angles  relative  to  the  axis  of  the  main

trend  of  laser  beam.  In  this  case  the  sizes/dimensions  of  cracks  in 
the  diameter  it  does  not  exceed  1.5-2  mm;  they,  as  a  rule,  are 
oriented  at  angle  of  45°  relative  to  the  axis  of  light  beam  and  their 
quantity  is  changed  depending  on  the  power  of  generation. 

But  if  we  focus  ray/beam  very  close  to  back  edge,  then  chipping 
of  surface  ( PMMA ,  glass)  occurs,  as  a  result  of  which  cratering  also 
is  observed. 

3.  Study  of  pictures  of  decomposition  in  dependence  on  power. 
Experimental  experiments  show  that  with  an  increase  in  the  power  form 
of  fracture  is  changed.  Are  increased  the  sizes/dimensions  of 
"plates"  in  the  diameter,  an  angle  of  the  slope  with  respect  to  the 
axis  of  laser  beam  and  a  quantity  of  cracks  (both  large  and  small 
sizes/dimensions)  in  the  unit  of  length  in  the  light  direction.  In 
this  case  the  microcracks  are  arranged/located  by  sizes/dimensions  to 
0.005  mm,  formed  as  a  result  of  decomposition,  not  only  on  the  axis  of 
ray/beam,  but  it  is  also  scattered  along  the  sides  at  different 
distance  from  it. 

Fig.  1  gives  photographs  of  decomposition  of  PMMA  under 
effect/action  of  laser  beam  with  two  power  coefficients.  Focusing  was 
produced  within  the  sample  by  lens  with  a  focal  length  of  33  mm.  In 
the  photographs  horizontal  arrow/pointer  indicates  the  direction  of 
laser  beam  for  the  given  pictures  of  decomposition,  vertical  -  places 
of  focusing.

Analysis  of  experimental  results  shows  that  with  energy  of 
output/yield  of  generation  in  10  joules  (Fig.  la)  maximum/overall 
diameter  of  crack  composes  2.1  mm  and  angles  of  slope  of  cracks  with 
respect  to  axis  of  ray/beam  it  does  not  exceed  45°.  But  in  the  case, 
when  energies  of  generation  are  approximately  20  joules  (Fig.  lb),  the 
sizes/dimensions  of  cracks  reach  4.1  mm  and  more.  In  both  cases  the 
minimal  sizes  of  cracks  comprise  to  0.2  mm.  In  this  case  the 
inclination/slope  of  cracks  to  the  axis  of  laser  beam  can  exceed  45°. 
This  is  especially  well  noticeable  at  the  power  of  generation  of 
approximately  20  joules.  From  the  comparison  of  photographs  (a)  and 
(b)  it  is  possible  to  easily  note  a  difference  in  form  of  fracture  not 
only  in  dimensions  of  cracks,  but  also  in  their  quantity  throughout 
the  entire  length  of  laser  beam  and  on  the  inclination/slope  of  some 


cracks .

Greatest  decomposition  is  observed  in  places  of  focusing  of  laser 
beam.  Here  all  cracks  are  strongly  charred.  Even  during  the  more 
powerful  regimes/conditions  of  generation  (about  20  joules)  in  the 

material  in  the  place  of  focusing  it  is  possible  to  observe  the

charred  cavities  (volumes).  For  the  example  in /fig.  lc  is  given  the 
photograph  of  decomposition  of  PMMA  in  the  place  of  focusing  (the 
enlarged  image  Fig.  lb).  From  the  photograph  one  can  see  well  that  in 


DOC  *  87064600 


PAGE 


1 

the  place  of  the  focusing  of  ray/beam  is  a  greatest  decomposition. 
Furthermore,  the  presence  of  many  cracks  of  different  diameter, 
arranged/located  at  different  angles  to  the  axis  of  ray/beam,  is 
evident . 

Experimental  results,  obtained  in  this  work,  aim  authors  on 
thought,  that  during  more  powerful/thicker  regimes/conditions  of 
generation  in  initial  stage  of  reaction  of  laser  emission  with 
transparent  materials  it  is  not  possible  to  explain  crack  formation  by 
effect  VKRMB ,  since  with  this  effect,  according  to  literature  data, 
must  be  formed  "plates"  with  inclination/slope  toward  axis  of  ray/beam 
at  angle  approximately  in  45°. 

Mechanism  of  decomposition  of  transparent  materials  under  action 
of  beams  of  lasers  during  powerful  mode  of  generation  to  us  is 
similar. 

With  passage  of  laser  beam  through  transparent  materials  in 
places  of  focusing  material  rapidly  is  heated  and  changes  into  liquid 
state,  in  which  occurs  further  energy  absorption  [9].  As  a  result  is 
formed  the  plasma,  which  is  expanded  at  a  high  speed.  Phenomenon  is 
reduced  to  the  point,  instantaneous  and  poverful/thick  explosion. 

This  process  carries  hydrodynamic  character  and  is  accompanied  by  the 
formation  of  shock  wave.  In  this  case  it  is  propagated  at  hypersonic 
speed,  which  leads  to  additional  decomposition  of  sample  both  up  to 
the  focus  of  laser  beam  and  after  it.

Presence  of  intensive  burning  of  material  and  formation  of 
numerous  cracks  at  different  angles  up  to  80—85°  with  respect  to  ax 
of  light  beam  can  serve  as  confirmation  of  fact  that  in  place  of 
focusing  plasma,  is  formed.  However,  after  the  focus  of  ray/beam 
crack  formation,  obviously,  occurs  due  to  the  propagation  of  the 
hypersonic  waves,  formed  during  the  explosion,  and  therefore  cracks 
with  the  inclination/slope  of  more  than  than  45°  are  not  observed.

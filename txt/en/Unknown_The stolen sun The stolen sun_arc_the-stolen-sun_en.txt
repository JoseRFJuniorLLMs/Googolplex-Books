The sun went strolling in the sky 
When suddenly a cloud came by. 
Bunny took a look outside. 
“Oh, how dark it is!” he cried. 


And the magpies on the farm 
Chattered loudly in alarm. 

They hopped about the hills and plains 
And shouted to the storks and cranes: 
“Listen, listen, everyone, 

The crocodile’s gobbled up the sun!” 


It got dark as dark can be, 
Not a thing could people see. 
He who ventured in the lane 
Was never, never seen again. 


So the timid little sparrow 

Kept on sobbing in his sorrow: 
“Please, dear sun, come out again! 
We can't see to peck our grain!” 


And the rabbits wept 

As they jumped and leapt: 
Home was still so far away 
And they couldn't see their way. 


Only in the murky swamp 

The pop-eyed lobsters dared to romp 
And the wolves beyond the hill 
Howled and growled around their kill. 


Early, early in the morning 

While the land was wrapped in mourning 
Loud and sharp came “Rat-tat-tat!” 
Goodness gracious, what was that? 


Two black sheep were at the gate: 
“Come out, folks, before it’s late! 
Come and fight in heroes’ style 

And save the sun from the crocodile!” 


But the shaggy folk were mute, 

Afraid to deal with such a brute. 

“Such great teeth! And he weighs a ton! 
He'll never give us back our sun!” 


So they ran to the bear in his lair. 

“Now, Bruin, there’s no time to spare. 
Come, Lazy-Bones, leave off sucking your paw 
Help us rescue the sun, let it shine as before.” 


But, although he was big and mighty, 

The bear didn’t feel like fighting. 

He roared and sobbed and he sobbed and roared 
As he called his cubs from the grassy sward: 


“Oh, children, come back to your poor old father!” 
He wept and he wept, searching farther and farther. 


And his wife, Mrs. Bear, 

Looked around everywhere, 

Under roots, under stumps, under stones, in despair: 
“Oh, my Eddy, Teddy and Pronto! 

Where, o where have you gone to! 

Have you fallen into a ditch and drowned, 

Or been torn to bits by a mad stray hound?” 


She wandered all day over marsh and scrub, 
But there wasn't a trace of a single cub. 
Only the black owls stared from the wood 
When at last, tired out, at her lair she stood. 


But then Mr. Bunny popped out 
And began to scold and to shout: 
“Stop whimpering like a hare! 
Don’t forget you're a bear!” 


“Go on, Bandy-Legs, and grab him, 
By the scaly collar nab him, 

Bash him up and underneath, 

Tear the sun from his ugły teeth. 


And as soon as it once more 
Shines in heaven as before, 
All y our little ones, 

All your pretty ones 

Will come running from afar: 
“Hullo, Daddy, here we are!’ ” 


And the bear he reared 
And the bear he roared 
And the bear he ran 
To the river ford.

Where the crocodile lay 
With the sun, of course, 
Shining away 

In his dreadful jaws— 
The golden sun, 

The stolen sun. 


Bruin crept up quietly 

And he poked him lightly: 

“Listen here, you ugly crook, 

Give us back that sun you took, 

Or I'll take you by the scruff 

And I’ll pound you into snuff! 

Yes, I'll teach you how to steal, 
You, cross between a toad and eel! 
All the world’s gone upside-down 
And he won't bother why or how!” 


But all the rascal did was laugh 
Till he almost split in half. 
“Get away, you big baboon, 
Or I'll gobble up the moon!”

“That's too much to bear!” 
Roared the angry bear, 
And his fangs went bare 

At the enemy. 


He hauled him up 
And he mauled him up: 
“Now, out with the sun, by golly!” 


And the crocodile 
Soon forgot his smile 
And he yelled in fright 


With all his might. 


From his jaw, 

From his maw 

The sun flew high 

Till it reached the sky, 
Andits bright light fell 
Over hill and dell. 


AZ dene, Na sun!” 
7K Gladly shouted everyone. 


Y All the birds took wing 
And began to sing, 
And the rabbits started dancing, 
Turning somersaults and prancing 
On the meadow by the spring. 


Then the bear-cubs came along 
And like jolly kittens 4 
Tugged and pulled at their shaggy dad > pO 
With their soft brown mittens, a, 

Shouting, calling Dad and Mum, i 
“Hullo, parents, here we come!” 


Every little girl and boy, 

Every beast just beamed with joy. 
They thanked old Bruin for the rescued sup 
And they all had lots and lots of fun.

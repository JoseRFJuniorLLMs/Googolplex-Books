Foreword 
This revised, second edition of The King in Jeopardy has been completely 
re-edited and corrected. Although the pagination of the previous edition 
was retained, each and every page was re-typeset and re-plated for this 
new printing.  
Ironically, testimony to the timelessness of this book’s material is given by 
an updated example, exercise 9 on page 191, Kramnik—Kasparov, 
Novgorod, 1997. Kramnik’s brilliant move that starts a winning 
combination against the world champion owes its conception to the more 
than a century and a half of attacking theory and practice reviewed in this 
book. GM Kramnik himself acknowledged his debt to the never-out-of-
date cornerstones of attacking chess when he remarked after the game, 
“Back in my childhood I was taught that such a (winning) motif is called 
overloading.” 
The King in Jeopardy is the fourth volume in the six-volume 
Comprehensive Chess Course series. This book assumes that the reader is 
familiar with the rules of chess. While it can also stand alone, this book 
builds on the basic chess concepts and tactical ideas outlined in the 
previous volumes of the Course.  
The Comprehensive Chess Course originated in the former Soviet Union 
as a means of providing students with the most effective chess training. 
Thousands of masters and grandmasters were raised on this course of 
study. The Comprehensive Chess Course is based on the method of 
repeatedly presenting certain problems to students. The problems become 
progressively more difficult, combining new ideas with familiar ones, 
thereby broadening the student’s knowledge and simultaneously 
reinforcing previously mastered material.  
Like all the other volumes in the Course, The King in Jeopardy is 
designed to be an ideal self-study guide. All the ideas are thoroughly 
explained.  
We wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge our heavy debt to FM 
Roman Pelts, our special editorial consultant. In addition our editorial 
advisers—Eric Johnson, Larry Parr, and Bleys Rose—provided a lot of 
useful criticism and ideas for improvements, for which we are grateful.

Important help was also received from Mark Ishee, while Lev Alburt’s 
students Dr. Martin Katahn and Greg Neu provided useful advice on how 
to make this book user-friendly for novices and non-masters.  
In preparing and marketing this second, revised edition of The King in 
Jeopardy, we’ve been fortunate to be assisted by Al Lawrence, formerly 
Executive Director of the US Chess Federation, and now President of 
OutExcel! Corporation. Al, who promoted USCF’s sales and membership 
to record highs, stays active in the world of chess. He’s co-authored three 
books, Chess for Children, Winning Chess: Piece by Piece, and (with GM 
Lev Alburt) Playing Computer Chess: Sharpening Your Game, all from 
Sterling Press, available from the US Chess Federation and on the internet 
at www.chesscafe.com. This website offers book reviews, photos, chess 
want ads, and general and technical articles by leading chess thinkers from 
around the world.

Introduction 
Every chess player, even one who has just taken his first steps in chess, 
becomes very inspired when he has a chance to make threats directly 
against the opponent’s king. Sometimes even the opportunity simply to 
make a move that gives check brings joy to the beginner! This reaction is 
easy to understand, since the goal of the game is to checkmate the king.  
When threats to the enemy king are created, sharp positions often occur. 
Sometimes these positions are full of chances to play beautiful 
combinations—one of the major reasons players are attracted to chess.  
Problems connected with making an attack on the king necessarily occupy 
an important place in the theory of the middlegame. It is important for 
players of all strengths to be able to storm the opponent’s king effectively, 
and this is the subject of our book.  
Because the attack on the king often involves various kinds of typical 
combinations and sacrifices, we also recommend that our readers 
familiarize themselves with various tactical devices by reading the 
previous book in this series, Chess Tactics for the Tournament Player.  
Among the many factors that go into evaluating any position, the relative 
positions of the kings are among the most important. By analyzing 
numerous examples, we will determine the important characteristics of 
each major category of positions, and we will also explain typical plans 
and methods for attack and defense.  
Because chess skill is gained primarily through repetition, we have 
included sets of exercises at the end of each major section of the book. We 
strongly encourage our readers to work through these exercises with a 
chess set, taking notes and reaching a general conclusion about each 
position before going on to the solutions page. At first the exercises may 
present quite a challenge, but the reader will soon notice an improvement 
in spotting the correct line of play, as well as in his or her overall thinking 
style. Time spent on the exercises (and the examples in the text) will soon 
translate into better understanding during one’s own tournament games, 
and into better results.

Our discussion is intended to be of direct practical benefit. Along the way 
we will make generalizations and conclusions, all of which are intended to 
give the readers the necessary experience and knowledge to allow them to 
navigate the choppy waters of tournament play. Our hope is that where our 
readers were formerly uncertain or hesitant, they will come to believe in 
their ability to attack as well as to defend. We hope that our readers, once 
armed with these new skills, will then use their creative potential to 
greater effect in the future.

Part I: 
The King in the Center  
Lesson One 
Attacking the King in the Center 
In most cases, the chess struggle begins in the center of the board, not on 
the flanks. Each player starts by trying to obtain dominance in the center 
by occupying one or more of the central squares — d4, d5, e4, e5. These 
squares are commonly called “the center” in chess literature. Control of 
the center, and of the neighboring squares within the rectangle enclosing 
c3, c6, f6 and f3 (known as the expanded or widened center) allows 
greater maneuverability and coordination among the pieces, and lays the 
foundation for a successful attack on the king.  
When we refer to an attack on the king in the center, we do not literally 
mean that the king is in the center of the board on d4, d5, e4 or e5, but that 
he has remained uncastled and is still on his initial square or on a nearby 
square on one of the central files. As we shall see, this placement of the 
king may prove to be quite fraught with danger in the middle game, or 
even during the transition from opening to the middle game.  
The clash of pawns in the center creates tension, and an exchange is likely 
to occur. Such an exchange will lead to the opening of one or more files or 
diagonals, which in turn allows pieces to achieve greater activity. If the 
opponent’s king is still in the center and one’s forces can be aimed in his 
direction, the road is now open for an attack. Defense may prove difficult, 
because without castling the defender’s rooks are disconnected and cannot 
easily be brought to the aid of the king.  
If there are open files in the center, these can be a highway for the 
attacking pieces. A piece which is in the center of the board enjoys greater 
freedom of action and has more options. This is especially true of knights, 
which travel more slowly than the bishop, rook, or queen. So when the 
enemy king sits on the central files, he is an easier target for an attack.

This is not to say that a king in the center is always bad, or in serious 
danger. If there is a solid pawn barrier in front of it, then the king can feel 
secure in his fortress. But you don’t encounter such exceptions very often. 
In most cases, an uncastled king is a juicy target.  
Principles for attacking the uncastled king 
The presence of the opposing king in the center does not by itself 
guarantee success for the attack. In order to get at the target you have to 
marshall your forces and find a way to break through whatever defense the 
enemy possesses. Your attack must be prepared, and there are two 
characterisics of such preparation. First, you have to have superior 
development. Second, you must grab hold of the initiative.  
When attacking an uncastled king, you should try to:  
1. Prevent the enemy king from fleeing the central area. The king is 
usually in much greater danger in the middle of the board.  
2. Open as many lines (files and diagonals) as possible leading 
toward the enemy king.  
3. Involve as many of your pieces in the attack as you can. The more 
pieces you use, the easier it is to develop an offensive, and the 
more difficult the defensive task becomes.  
4. Keep the opposing army disorganized. When the king is in the 
center on the back rank, it interferes with the communication 
between the rooks, and this makes it more difficult to organize the 
defense. It is best to keep your opponent’s lines of communication 
broken.  
Keep these four principles in mind as we look at some examples of 
successful attacks against the king in the center.  
Sacrifice to open lines

Diagram 1

Position after Black’s 7th move  
By sacrificing a piece White keeps the opponent’s king in the center and 
organizes a direct attack.  
 
8. Nxf7! 
Kxf7 
9. Qf3+

Diagram 2  
 
 
 
9. ...  
Ke6  
 
Black must play this move to keep the extra piece, or else White will have 
the advantage without any risk. Other moves don’t give Black any hope 
for equality:  
A) 9. ... Ke8 10. Bxd5 Rf8 (10. ... Ne5 11. Qh5+ Ng6 12. Re1, or 10. ... 
Qd6 11. Qf7+ Kd8 12. Qxg7 Bf6 13. Bg5) 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Qxc6+ 
Bd7 13. Qc4 and Black doesn’t have compensation for a pawn.  
B) 9. ... Bf6 10. Bxd5+ Be6 11. Bxe6+. (Winning a pawn in this position 
makes no sense because after 11. Bxc6 bxc6 12. Qxc6, Black has better 
development and two strong bishops.) 11. ... Kxe6 and now, after the 
simple 12. Bf4, Black’s king is uncomfortably placed in the center and 
cannot find refuge; for example, 12. ... Kf7 13. Qb3+, or 12. ... Kd7 13. 
Qh3+.

10. Nc3! 
 
This sacrifice helps White develop his attack in a swift and forceful 
manner. In this game the opponent’s king ended up literally in the center 
of the board!  
 
Diagram 3  
 
 
 
10. ...  
dxc3  
11. Re1+  
Ne5 
 
Black’s reply is forced.  
 
12. Bf4  
Bf6  
 
If Black tries 12. ... c6, White plays 13. Rxe5+ Kd7 (if 13. ... Kf7 instead, 
there follows 14. Bxd5+ cxd5 15. Rxe7+ winning the queen or creating an

irresistible attack) 14. Rxd5+ cxd5 15. Qxd5+ Ke8 16. Qf7+ Kd7 17. Bb5 
mate.  
 
13. Bxe5  
Bxe5 
 
 
 
Diagram 4  
 
 
 
14. Rxe5+!  
Kxe5 
15. Re1+  
Kd4  
16. Bxd5

Diagram 5  
 
 
 
Black has an extra rook, but his “centralized” king appears to be in a 
mating net. Right now White’s main threat is 17. Qxc3+ Kxd5 18. Re5+ 
Kd6 19. Qc5+ Kd7 20. Qd5 mate. In addition, White is also threatening 
17. Qe4+ Kc5 18. b4+ Kb5 ( If 18. ... Kb6, then 19. Qd4+ Ka6 20. Qc4+ 
b5 21. Qc6 mate, and 18. ... Kd6 will be followed by 19. Qe5+ Kd7 20. 
Qe6 mate) 19. a4+ Kxa4 20. Ra1+ with mate to follow. The same idea can 
be seen after 17. Qd3+ Kc5 18. b4+ etc.  
Of course now Black cannot recapture with 16. ... Qxd5? because of 17. 
Qxc3 mate. Let’s look at some other possible variations:  
1. 16. ... c6 17. Qe3+ Kxd5 18. Qe5+ Kc4 19. Re4+ and mate next 
move.  
2. 16. ... Qf6 17. Rd1+ Kc5 (or 17. ... Ke5 18. Qe4+ Kd6 19. Bc4+ ) 
18. Qe3+ Kb5 19. a4+ Kxa4 20. Qe4+, etc.  
3. 16. ... Qg5 17. Qd3+ Kc5 18. b4+ Kxb4 19. Qd4+.  
4. 16. ... Qd6 17. b4 Qxb4 18. Re4+ Kc5 19. Qe3+.  
 
16. ...

17. Qd3+  
Kc5  
18. b4+!  
Kxb4

19. Qd4+  
  
 
Diagram 6  
 
 
 
And White will announce checkmate in a few moves. In this game 
Morphy showed excellent technique in pursuing the attack on the king in 
the center. White’s play is even more impressive when we consider that 
the game was played more than a hundred years ago in what is known as a 
simultaneous blindfold exhibition!  
Punishment for losing time in the opening

3. Bc4  
Qh4+  
4. Kf1

The purpose of this counter-sacrifice is to deflect White’s bishop from the 
f7-square.  
 
5. Bxb5  
Nf6  
6. Nf3  
Qh6

Diagram 8  
 
 
 
It seems more natural to play 6. ... Qh5, but Kieseritsky wants to leave the 
h5-square vacant for the knight. The move 6. ... Qh6 is characteristic of 
games from the last century, and is a good illustration of the thinking of 
that time. By this we mean the tendency to play for tactics alone, without 
sufficient attention to control of the center and the coordination of the 
pieces.  
 
7. d3

Diagram 9 
 
 
 
Black builds his game on small tactical threats which are easy to stop. 
Better was 9. ... c6.  
 
8. Nh4  
 
The threat was 8. ... Ng3+. On 8. Kg1? Black would play 8. ... Qb6+.  
 
8. ...  
Qg5  
 
Also deserving attention is 8. ... Bb7, so that on 9. g4 Nf6 10. Nf5 Black 
has the reply 10. ... Qh3+.  
 
9. Nf5 
c6 
10. g4 
Nf6

Diagram 10  
 
 
 
11. Rg1! 
 
When he offered his bishop to Kieseritsky, Anderssen could not have 
calculated all the variations to the end. But the awkward position of 
Black’s queen, plus White’s advantage in development, make this a 
promising piece sacrifice. Notice that in order to accept the material, 
Black must also weaken his d5-square.  
 
11. ... 
cxb5 
12. h4 
Qg6 
13. h5

14. Qf3

Now the threat is 15. Bxf4, trapping Black’s queen. Black is forced to lose 
more tempi in order to provide a retreat.  
 
14. ... 
Ng8 
15. Bxf4 
Qf6 
 
Diagram 12

The sad outcome of the opening is a gaping hole on d5, and a huge 
advantage for White in the mobilization of his forces. We can see all the 
preconditions for a decisive attack on the king.  
 
16. Nc3 
Bc5 
17. Nd5! 
  
 
Diagram 13 
 
 
 
Of course there is no happiness for Black in the simple 17. d4. However, 
Anderssen sensed that the time was right for more energetic action.  
 
17. ... 
Qxb2 
 
Now both of White’s rooks are under attack.

Diagram 14 
 
 
 
18. Bd6!?  
 
This quiet move, which offers a double rook sacrifice, made a great impact 
on the chess world at the time this game was played. However, the 
superiority of White’s position is without question. His queen and three 
minor pieces are ready to demolish Black’s king, which is stuck in the 
center. Black’s queen is out on a long journey and is unable to help the 
king.  
No wonder that in addition to the very effective move played by 
Anderssen (18. Bd6), White had another, objectively stronger continuation 
of attack — 18. Be3. Here are some variations:  
(A) 18. ... Qxa1+ 19. Kg2 Qxg1+. (If 19. ... Qb2, then 20. Bxc5 Qxc2+ 
21. Kh3 Qxc5 22. Rc1, and White will win, e.g. 22. ... Qxc1 23. Nd6+ 
Kd8 24. Nxf7+ Ke8 25. Nd6+ and 26. Qf8 mate.) 20. Bxg1 and Black has 
no defense against White’s threats:  
(A1) 20. ... Bxg1 21. Nd6+ Kd8 22. Nxf7+ Ke8 23. Nd6+ and 24. Qf8 
mate.

(A2) 20. ... d6 21. Bxc5 Bxf5. (Instead 21. ... dxc5 will be followed by 
checkmate in seven moves with 22. Nd6+ Kd7 23. Qxf7+ Kxd6 24. Qc7+ 
Ke6 etc.) 22. Nc7+ Kd7 23. Nxa8 dxc5 24. Qxf5+ Kd8 25. Qe5, with an 
easy win.  
(A3) 20. ... Bf8 21. Nc7+ Kd8 22. Nxa8 Bb7 23. Bxa7 Nc6 24. Bb6+ Kc8 
25. Qg3 and White wins.  
(B) 18. ... Qa3 (18. ... Bf8 19. Bd4) 19. Bxc5 Qxc5 20. e5 d6 21. Nxd6+ 
Kd7 22. Qf5+ Kc6 23. Qxc8+ Kxd5 24. c4+ bxc4 25. dxc4+ Kd4 26. 
Rd1+, and Black gets checkmated.  
(C) 18. ... d6 19. Bd4! Bxd4 20. Nxd6+ Kd8 (20. ... Kd7 21. Qxf7+ Kxd6 
22. Qc7+ Ke6 23. Nf4+ Kf6 24. g5 mate) 21. Qxf7 with unstoppable 
checkmate threats.  
 
18. ...  
Bxg1  
 
Diagram 15 
 
 
 
After this Anderssen’s combination wins by force. But as Steinitz pointed 
out, 18. ... Qxa1+ 19. Ke2 Qb2! left some hope for Black. Even though 
Anderssen’s idea is widely acknowledged as a stroke of genius, his precise 
method of implementing that idea can still be improved. A combination is

only beautiful when it is correct. A sacrifice should not only be the most 
effective, but also objectively the best continuation.  
 
19. e5!! 
 
Diagram 16 
 
 
 
Another remarkably quiet move. Already one rook and a minor piece 
down, Anderssen allows his opponent to take the second rook with a 
check! But by blocking the a1-h8 diagonal and cutting off the Black queen 
from defending the g7-square, White is now threatening checkmate with 
20. Nxg7+ and 21. Bc7.  
 
19. ... 
Qxa1+ 
20. Ke2 
  
 
Now Kieseritsky protects c7 to stop the mate threat: 21. Nxg7+ Kd8 22. 
Bc7 mate.

20. ...  
Na6  
21. Nxg7+  
Kd8  
22. Qf6+! 
  
 
The final sacrifice, deflecting the knight from the defense of e7.  
 
22. ...  
Nxf6  
23. Be7 mate. 
  
 
Diagram 17  
 
 
 
This game shows how dangerous it is to play with only one or two pieces, 
neglecting development. In the final position White is down a queen, two 
rooks and a bishop! In 1855 Wiener Schachzeitung magazine published a 
detailed analysis of this game, where for the first time it was described as 
“The Immortal Game.”  
Exchanging to prevent castling

Diagram 18 
Steinitz — von Bardeleben 
Hastings, 1895  
 
 
 
Position after Black’s 10th move  
At first it may seem as though Black has a satisfactory position. However, 
with a simple series of exchanges, White keeps the Black king in the 
center and then creates an attack followed by an effective combination.  
 
11. Bxd5!  
Bxd5  
 
It’s not good to take the bishop on g5 because after 11. ... Bxg5 12. Bxe6 
fxe6 13. Qb3 Black is unable to protect the e6-pawn, and on 13. ... Nxd4 
there would follow 14. Nxd4 Qxd4 15. Qb5+, winning a piece.  
 
12. Nxd5  
Qxd5  
 
Taking the bishop on g5 is still bad since Black loses a pawn: 12. ... Bxg5 
13. Nxc7+ Qxc7 14. Nxg5.

13. Bxe7  
Nxe7 
14. Re1  
  
 
Diagram 19 
 
 
 
This is the point of White’s previous play. By pinning the knight, White 
prevents Black from castling into safety, and keeps the Black king in the 
“danger zone” in the center of the board.  
 
14. ...  
f6  
 
Black prepares an exit on f7 for his king, since he cannot castle.  
 
15. Qe2  
Qd7 
 
The Black queen not only had to protect the knight, but also had to cover 
the b5-square.

16. Rc1 
 
The second rook also occupies an important file.  
 
16. ...  
c6? 
 
This overly optimistic move is probably a decisive mistake. Instead 16. ... 
Kf7 was more logical, to connect the rooks and eventually to bring his 
king to safety.  
 
17. d5! 
 
Diagram 20  
 
 
 
This remarkable pawn sacrifice opens a second file and also frees the 
central square d4 for the knight, from where he will threaten to invade the 
opponent’s camp, especially on the weakened e6-square. If Black declines

the sacrifice, then after 18. dxc6 White will create an attack on the open 
central files while maintaining material equality. 
 
17. ...  
cxd5  
18. Nd4  
Kf7  
19. Ne6  
Rhc8  
 
Black defends against a rook invasion on c7. If 19. ... Nc6, then 20. Nc5; 
for example, 20. ... Qc8 21. Qh5+, etc.  
 
20. Qg4  
g6

However, Black can counter with a witty reply.

White does not have an escape hatch against Black’s threatened back-rank 
mate, so White cannot take the queen. At the same time, all of White’s 
pieces are under attack! Nevertheless White’s combination is correct.

Recall the Principles for Attacking the Uncastled King 
 
1. Keep the opposing king in the center.  
2. Open lines to the opposing king.  
3. Involve as many of your pieces in the attack as you can.  
4. Keep the enemy disorganized.

A practical decision 
Diagram 30 
Gruenfeld — Spielmann  
Shopron, 1934 
 
 
 
Position after White’s 12th move  
The Black pieces are perfectly developed, but if Black doesn’t act quickly 
his temporary advantage in development will evaporate. Since the White 
king is still in the center of the board, Black should of course think about 
attacking him. But how can he do it?  
This position currently has a closed character. Both of Black’s bishops are 
limited in their activities. The open c-file cannot be used efficiently, and it 
is the only open file on the board. After initially considering this position, 
we can speculate that Black’s advantage in development does not give him 
real chances to assume the initiative, and that White will be able to 
equalize by finishing his development.  
GM Spielmann, however, was a brilliant tactician, and he finds an 
interesting way of developing the initiative.  
 
12. ... 
e5!

A completely unexpected and beautiful move, the meaning of which will 
become clear in a moment.  
 
13. fxe5 
 
White is forced to take the pawn, because otherwise the center will 
become open and his lack of development will become more important.  
 
13. ... 
Nxe5! 
 
Black’s whole idea is in this sacrifice. Again, White has no choice since 
after 14. Be2 Nc4! Black assumes the initiative at no cost.  
 
14. dxe5 
 
Diagram 31

14. ... 
d4!  
 
Now Black is very close to his goal of opening up the game. The question 
is whether or not the newly opened lines of attack are worth the piece 
sacrifice. It is interesting that Spielmann in his book The Art of Sacrifice in 
Chess said of this position:  
 
The opening-up of lines must be carried out ruthlessly. In annotating this 
game for a chess periodical, I wrote the following comment at this stage: 
The sacrifice of the knight cannot be vindicated by analysis, and it would 
possibly have been refuted in a correspondence game. But in a contest 
over the board and with a time limit of eighteen moves an hour, it would 
nearly always win out.  
 
From this we can conclude that Spielmann himself was not sure whether 
or not the sacrifice was correct, when approaching the question from a 
theoretical point of view. Should this confuse us?  
No, it should not. We gave this example to you on purpose, because we 
consider it a useful reminder that unclear sacrifices like this one — which 
do not immediately lead to mate or the win of material — are very 
common.

Diagram 32  
 
 
 
15. Nd1 
 
After 15. Ne2 Bxe5 16. exd4 Bxd4 17. Nxd4 Qxd4, Black has only one 
pawn for the piece, but the White king will remain in the center for quite a 
while, and Black should be able to use all his pieces in an attack.  
Deserving attention is 15. exd4. In that case it would be better for Black to 
decline the check on h4 and play simply 15. ... Qxd4, because 15. ... Qh4+ 
16. Kd1 Qxd4 would let White bring his king to a comparatively safe 
place: 17. Qa4 (if 17. Kc2, then 17. ... Rac8) 17. ... Qxe5 18. Kc2.

become a reality, for example, after 18. ... Bxa2 19. Bd3 Be6 20. Qh6 Bg7 
21. Qf4, and Black’s three pawns do not fully compensate for the piece 
because the White king is no longer in danger.  
 
18. ... 
Qe7 
19. Be2  
  
 
White’s desire to castle as soon as possible is completely understandable. 
However, Black’s next move shows that this wish will not come true, and 
White therefore appears to be under a serious attack.  
It would also not be good to play 19. Bd3 because of 19. ... Bf4+ 20. Kd1 
Bxd2 21. Kxd2 Qb4+, for example: 22. Kc2 Qa4+ 23. Kd2 Qxa2, and

d. 25. Rcl ! is the best move. Now Black does not have anything

Opening or middlegame? 
Diagram 40 
Tolush — Botvinnik 
XIth USSR Championship, 1939

Position after White’s 9th move  
Black is going into the middlegame, but White seems to be stuck in the 
opening since he is a long way from completing the development of his 
pieces. To take appropriate action, Black must first take stock of the 
situation.  
First, White’s king is in the center. Second, all of White’s pieces on the 
kingside are standing in their initial positions. Finally, Black’s queen, 
rook, bishop and knight are placed well and — very importantly — they 
are interacting harmoniously. The fact that at the moment White has two 
extra pawns does not seem important, because one of them can be taken 
immediately and the other would hardly be enough compensation for the 
weaknesses in White’s position.  
Let’s see how the fight went, and analyze the main variations.  
 
9. ... 
Nxd5 
 
Diagram 41 
 
 
 
Black has such powerful threats that taking the knight on d5 seems to be 
the only move for White, because 10. Rd1 Bxc3 11. bxc3 Nc6, with the 
threats 12. ... Nxf4 and 12. ... Nxc3, favors Black. But after 10. Nxd5

Qxd2+ 11. Kxd2 Rxd5+ Black’s advantage is also clear. For example: 12. 
Ke1 Bxb2 13. Rc2 (or 13. Bc4 Bxc1 14. Bxd5 Ba3) 13. ... Ba3 or 12. Kc2 
Bf5+ 13. Kb3 Rd2, etc.  
So our first impression appears to be correct: White’s position is worse. 
However, this conclusion would be hasty, because we did not consider the 
move which was played in the game.  
 
10. Bc7!? 
 
An unexpected and beautiful move. Does it save White?  
 
10. ...  
Qxc7  
11. Nxd5 
  
 
Diagram 42 
 
 
 
It seems that the situation has changed. If Black now plays 11. ... Qd7 
White has the strong answer 12. Rd1! with the main threat 13. Nc7!, so

that Black cannot respond with either 12. ... e6 or 12. ... Kf8. But instead 
Black has the simple developing move 12. ... Nc6 defending against this 
threat. How can we evaluate this position?  
While we may not be able to find much noticeable improvement in the 
placement of White’s forces, Black’s position became less harmonious — 
the queen on d7 is not well placed because it blocks the bishop. We should 
conclude that after 11. ... Qd7 Black does not have sufficient 
compensation for his pawn minus.  
However, Black has a strong reply that underlines the basic weakness in 
White’s position (lack of development), and supports the assessment that 
in the initial position White stands worse.  
 
11. ...  
Rxd5!  
 
Diagram 43 
 
 
 
By sacrificing the Exchange, Black not only liquidates White’s main 
trump—his centralized knight—but also finishes developing the rest of his 
pieces with a gain of time. It is clear that White’s defense will be difficult 
because his whole kingside is unmoved.

12. Qxd5 
Be6 
 
Black’s main goal is complete mobilization of his forces. That is why 
capturing the pawn on b2 would be incorrect. On 12. ... Bxb2 White would 
reply 13. Rc2 Qa5+ (or 13. ... Be6) 14. Qd2, winning a tempo for 
developing the kingside.  
 
13. Qd2 
 
On 13. Qe4 Black would take the pawn with 13. ... Bxb2, when it would 
not be possible to play 14. Rc2 because of 14. ... Bf5. And on 14. Rd1, 
Black plays 14. ... Qa5+.  
 
13. ...  
Nc6 
 
Diagram 44  
 
 
 
14. Rd1

White is facing a difficult problem — he cannot meet Black’s intended ... 
Rd8 without serious material losses.  
White’s last move does nothing to develop the kingside and fails to 
provide a satisfactory defense. Maybe White should have tried giving back 
the material with 14. Rc3, after which 14. ... Rd8 is not dangerous 
anymore because of the answer 15. Rd3. After 14. Rc3 Bxc3 15. Qxc3 
Bxa2 16. Nf3 White, too, can hope for a successful defense.  
However, after 14. Rc3, Black need not be in a hurry to regain the 
Exchange, and should play 14. ... Nb4 (as recommended by former World 
Champion Botvinnik) with the better game.  
 
14. ...

The awkward 16. Ke2 is met by 16. ... Qb5+ 17. Ke1 (on 17. Kf3 Black’s 
answer would be 17. ... Rxd1 18. Qxd1 Qxb2. After winning the a-pawn, 
Black will have achieved approximate material equality, while enjoying a 
strong passed pawn and a continuing attack.) 17. ... Rxd1+ 18. Qxd1 Qxb2 
with a strong attack, which should win quickly.  
 
Diagram 46  
 
 
 
16. ...  
Rd5  
 
Black concentrates on improving the position of his pieces to the 
maximum. His active pieces will force White to return the invested 
material, with interest.

17. Ne2 
 
After 17. Nf3 Black wins with 17. ... Rxc5—for example, 18. Qa1 Nb4 19. 
Nd4 Nc2+ 20. Nxc2 Rxc2 21. Qd1 Rxb2 or 18. Qb1 Bxa2 19. Qa1 Nb4,

Position after Black’s 11th move 
White’s knight is under attack, and it seems that after the horseman moves 
Black will have good play. However, a deep examination of the position 
led GM Holmov to play an unexpected move to keep Black’s king in the 
center.

12. Nc6! 
 
This penetration of the White knight into the enemy camp, from where 
there is no escape, demanded long and exact calculations.

12. ...  
Qd7 
 
An important alternative is 12. ... Qxd1. After 13. Rxd1 White threatens 
checkmate, so Black must move the c8-bishop. After 13. ... Bb7 White 
plays 14. Nd5. (The paradoxical reply 14. ... Kd7 is refuted by 15. Ncxe7 
followed by 16. Bg5. If 14. ... Kf8, then 15. Nc7 and 15. ... Bxc6 leads to

with an excellent position.) If, for example, 14 ... Bxc6 15. Nc7+ Kf8 16.

The same variations would occur after 13. ... Bd7 14. Nd5. White also 
would have an advantage after 13. ... Be6 14. Nb5 or 13. ... Bf5 14. Nd5.

Both this move and Black’s next one make White’s task of advancing the

the rook on h8 could enter the battle and perform some defensive 
functions. The bishop would provide additional support and there would 
then be some hope of exchanging pieces and blunting the attack. When 
trying to defend after a sacrifice, rapid development is essential.

But even here Black would not have survived long because he is too far 
behind in development and has too many problems to solve. Let’s look at 
a sample line: 18. ... Be7 19. Rac1 Re8 20. Red1! and White is effectively

Lesson Two 
When the King is Safe in the Center 
In Lesson One we saw many examples of why it is dangerous to leave the 
king uncastled. But we also said that it’s not always bad for the king to 
stay in the center. Castling may not be necessary (or may not even be 
desirable!) when the center of the board is blocked by pawns.  
Let’s look at some positions in which one side’s king is well placed in the 
center.  
 
 
 
Is castling necessary? 
Diagram 84 
Kmoch — Alekhine 
Vienna, 1922

Position after White’s 12th move  
Both sides are approximately equally developed. Black’s king is still in the 
center, and if this were always a serious disadvantage, then of course 
Black should think about castling. It is bad for Black to castle short now 
because the h5-pawn is under attack. And playing ... Qe7 with the idea of 
castling long is dangerous because White is well placed for a pawn 
advance on that wing.  
By rigidly thinking that castling is always necessary, in this position we 
would be making a mistake. Why should we be in a hurry to castle? In the 
center Black has a strong wall of pawns, which prevents the possibility of 
actually opening the game. And since this position is closed, Black’s king 
is probably safe on his home square.  
Of course, without castling it will be difficult for Black to use his rook on 
a8 for activities on the kingside. But notice that the White rook on a1 also 
will not play an active role if Black develops an attack on the other side of 
the board. When the center is locked, play then shifts to the wings. 
Ironically, it is White who stands worse here, because he has castled!  
By thinking along these lines, we come to the conclusion that Black can 
start active play on the kingside without worrying about removing his king 
from the center.  
 
12. ... 
g5! 
 
Black is not worried about 13. Bxh5 because then 13. ... gxf4 14. exf4 will 
be followed by 14. ... Qh4 with a winning attack. Also 13. fxg5 simply 
opens the g-file for the attack. In his notes to this game, Alekhine wrote 
that best for White is 13. Nc4. But even in this case, after the simple 13. ... 
gxf4 14. exf4 Nf6, Black stands better, with play on the open g-file and 
chances against White’s weak d-pawn.  
 
13. g3

White made this move so that 13. ... gxf4 could be met by 14. gxf4. 
However, this move also weakens the squares around White’s king.  
 
Diagram 85  
 
 
 
13. ...

If 13. ... h4, then White would prevent the opening of files by 14. g4. Here 
14. fxg5 is bad because of 14. ... Ng4.  
 
14. Bb2 
 
It would be better to play 14. Nc4, because now Black immediately opens 
the position of the king.

Harmonious regrouping 
Diagram 87 
Kotov — Keres 
Budapest, 1950  
 
 
 
Position after Black’s 13th move  
How would you assess the position in the diagram above? Black’s pieces 
are fully mobilized, and his last move (... d7-d5) attacks, and threatens to 
win, White’s weak c4-pawn. The White king is still in the center, and his 
queen and knight are not well placed. Even worse, White cannot protect 
the c4-pawn, so it seems that to save it White must exchange his strong 
e5-pawn with e5xd6 en passant. This sort of reasoning leads to the

conclusion that Black’s position is better, but this conclusion would be 
wrong.  
For if we look more deeply into the position, we can see that it is 
impossible for Black to threaten the White king, which is very safe behind 
the strong wall of pawns. In fact, it is the position of Black’s king that has 
been weakened (by ... h7-h6). White can coordinate his pieces toward the 
enemy kingside. Both of White’s bishops are already pointed in that 
direction. White’s task is to find a way to bring his queen and knight into 
the attack. Notice also that two of Black’s minor pieces are far away from 
the king’s flank, and the third one is pinned at the moment. Kotov’s next 
move is therefore quite logical, and gives him a strong attack on the Black 
king.  
 
14. Bb1!  
 
White abandons his pawn on c4! It is rare to see this kind of move 
followed by an exclamation mark, but in this particular situation this move 
is the strongest. White plans to play Qc2, threatening mate. What can 
Black do? If 14. ... Bxc4 then 15. Qc2 g6 16. Qd2 Kh7 17. Bf6 Nb3 18. 
Ng5+ hxg5 19. Qxg5 or 18. ... Kg8 19. Qf4 Nxa1 20. Qh4 h5 21. Qxh5! 
gxh5 22. Bh7 mate. If 14. ... f6, then 15. Nf4. Unpinning the e7-knight 
with 14. ... Qe8 is not good either, e.g. 15. Qc2 Ng6 ( if 15. ... Nf5 then 16. 
g4) 16. cxd5 exd5 17. Nf4.  
 
14. ...  
g5  
 
Black unpins his knight with the idea of using it for defense, but Kotov 
effectively refutes this maneuver.  
 
15. Qc2  
Ng6

After 15. ... Nf5 the knight is too exposed, either by the immediate 16. g4, 
or 16. Bf2 with the threat of g2-g4.  
 
Diagram 88  
 
 
 
16. Nf4!  
 
Let us go back to the initial position (Diagram 87). Could we imagine that 
after just three moves all of White’s minor pieces and queen would 
interact as well as they do now?  
 
16. ...

Other moves are equally unsatisfactory. For example: 16. ... Qe8 17. Nh5 
Qc6 (if 17. ... f5 then 18. exf6 e.p. gxh4 19. cxd5 exd5+ 20. Kf2 or 19. ... 
Kh7 20. Kf2 and White’s rook will come into play on the e-file) 18. cxd5

strong.

Correctly evaluating the king in the center 
The last two examples (of Part I) should help you in determining how to 
evaluate the position correctly. Most of the time it is ill-advised to leave 
the king in the center because it is usually possible for the other side to 
open the game and develop an attack on the uncastled king. However, it’s 
important not to overestimate the negative side of this situation. If the 
position is of a closed character, then having the king in the center may 
sometimes even be desirable.  
The player who wants to improve his level of play must learn to weigh the 
advantages and disadvantages of castling, and to draw correct conclusions 
about whether it is good or bad for the king to remain in the center through 
the opening and into the middlegame.  
In all cases where having one’s king in the center may be considered an 
error, the attacker must answer some important questions:  
1. How do I keep the enemy king in the center?  
2. Can I open more lines near the king?  
3. Are my threats strong enough to give me the initiative?

4. How will I break into my opponent’s position?  
Solving these problems may require the sacrifice of material (sometimes 
in ways that are impossible to calculate completely), and may involve 
taking some risks. Not every player is willing to accept the same level of 
risk-taking, even when it is based on something very specific (such as the 
king trapped in the center). Insecurity about taking risks arises from a lack 
of knowledge and experience. Confidence in evaluating positions grows as 
the result of training and practice.

Black would be winning — after 27. Qxf7 axb5 28. Rh7 he has file strong 
reply 28. ... Qe1+ 29. Ka2 Qb4!, and if 30. Rh8+ Kd7 31. Rxa8 the in-
between move 31. ... Qc4+! leaves white without any chances. In the 
actual game Black missed his chance with 26. ... Qxh5? 27. Rxh5 and the 
game ended in a draw on the 85th move.  
 
If the position is closed, then having the king in the center may 
sometimes even be desirable!

Part II: 
Attacks with Same-Side Castling  
Lesson Three 
Piece Attacks with Same-Side Castling 
In Part I, we discussed situations when one side does not castle, focusing 
especially on cases where a direct attack is possible on the king in the 
center. But in most games, both players take care to bring their kings to 
safety by castling.  
Now let us discuss one of the critical questions of chess strategy. Is it 
possible to lead a successful attack on a castled king if the position of the 
pawns that protect him is strong, and there are no obvious weaknesses?  
If we ask the average chess player this question, he is likely to say “no.” 
Many players think that attacking a strongly-defended king accomplishes 
nothing.  
But this conclusion is incorrect!  
Even the strongest castled position is not always reliable protection for 
the king. Of course if there are already weaknesses near your opponent’s 
king, or if you can create them, then your attack will develop easier and 
faster.  
We will illustrate these ideas with examples taken from real games. 
Consider the following position:

Diagram 105 
Palatnik — Geller 
USSR, 1980 
 
 
 
Black to move  
 
15. ...  
Bxg2?  
16. Rg1  
Bc6  
 
On 16. ... Qd5 White plays 17. Qg4 and at the very least wins the bishop 
on g2.  
 
17. Rxg7+! 
 
Black resigns, since after 17. ... Kxg7 18. Qg4+ Kh8 19. Qf5 mate at h7 is 
inevitable.

But you can’t always count on such cooperation from your opponent every 
time you want to launch an attack against the castled king! Usually you 
have to do quite a bit of preparation. Your pieces must be deployed in 
positions where they can reach the enemy king, and they must be well-
coordinated. You should be particularly sensitive to small weaknesses in 
the enemy’s pawn structure, and you should strive to create such 
weaknesses near his king, even when this requires you to sacrifice 
material.  
When both sides are castled on the same flank, the attack on the enemy 
king can be conducted either with both pieces and pawns or with just 
pieces. We can distinguish two main attacking methods: piece attacks and 
pawn storms.  
Of course an important question to ask is: When should the attack involve 
pawns, and when should it be led without them? Can we determine the 
proper role of pawns in an attack with kings castled on the same side? Is 
there a strategic basis for determining correct attacking methods?  
To this question we must reply positively. The character of an attack is 
determined by the nature of the position. We emphasize this idea from the 
beginning so that it will be in your mind as you study the following 
lessons.  
Let’s move on to some specific examples, and as we go along we will 
make useful comments and draw conclusions. Our introductory game is a 
kingside pawn attack by Steinitz that demonstrates the correct application 
of attacking ideas. Subsequent examples will distinguish between cases 
when a pawn attack is appropriate, and when it is best to attack only with 
pieces.  
The stronger side must attack!

The purpose of Black’s last move was to regroup and prepare for central 
expansion with moves like ... Rad8 and ... d6-d5. If he had enough time, 
he would eventually achieve harmony among his forces. But now it is 
White’s move! At this moment White correctly decides he has the 
advantage and he must react energetically to stop Black’s consolidation.  
Steinitz observed that in situations where one side has an advantage and 
can point to clear reasons for starting an attack, he should attack. 
Otherwise the advantage will just evaporate.  
There is nothing odd about this principle. It is logical that if your pieces 
are harmoniously placed and ready for an attack, you must find a way to 
take advantage of this; otherwise, your opponent will make his position 
better and you will lose your advantage and your chance to attack.

So the moment has arrived in this game where the stronger side not only 
can be active, but must be active. With his last move, White started an 
attack on Black’s king.  
Steinitz also said that the attack should always be focused on the weakest 
square in the opponent’s position. Here Black’s kingside is vulnerable 
because White can take immediate steps to increase his space advantage 
there. White also has a strong position in the center, which is essential 
before starting a pawn advance on the side. This game is a good example 
of how a stable position in the center can allow one side to attack with 
pawns and to open lines against the enemy king.  
 
13. f4

This is the first flash of lightning in the pawn storm. The idea is to drive 
the defending forces (knights) away from their posts and seize space on 
the kingside.

The attacking side usually tries to avoid exchanges, which tend to dilute 
the strength of the attack. More specifically, the attacker is willing to trade 
a non-attacking piece for a defending piece, while the defender wants to 
exchange off as many attackers as possible to limit the force of the attack.  
By keeping his pieces on the board, Steinitz soon crashes through his 
opponent’s position.

Invading weak squares

Diagram 119 
Alatortsev—Boleslavsky 
XVIIIth USSR Championship, 1950 
 
 
 
Position after White’s 19th move  
 
The position of White’s king is weakened because of the pawn on g3, and 
this weakening is even more serious because Black still has a light-
squared bishop on the board. In keeping with Steinitz’s principle, Black’s 
main idea is to organize an immediate attack against the weakest squares 
in White’s position — h3 and g2.  
 
19. ...  
Bh3  
20. f4  
  
 
What would have happened if White moved his rook? Let’s try some 
sample lines:

1. 20. Rfe1 then 20. ... Rxf2!, and White cannot play 21. Kxf2? 
because of 21. ... Qe3 mate.  
2. 20. Rfc1 Rxf2 (anyway!) 21. Kxf2 Qe3+ 22. Ke1 Qg1+ 23. Kd2 
Rxe2+ 24. Kxe2 Qxh2+ winning the queen.  
3. 20. Rfb1 (to protect the queen), but then 20. ... Rxf2 21. Kxf2 
Qe3+ 22. Ke1 Bg4 (threatening 23. ... Qg1+ and 24. ... Rxe2+) 23. 
Kf1 Rf8+ 24. Ke1 Rf2.  
By playing 20. f4, White hoped to organize a successful defense after the 
“obvious” 20. ... Qc5+ 21. Rf2 followed by Bf1-g2.  
 
20. ...  
Bxf1!  
 
A brilliant move! By sacrificing the queen Black weakens White’s 
position to the maximum extent, and begins an unstoppable attack.

22. Qc3 
Among White’s alternatives 22. Qd4 is the most active, and the only one 
requiring analysis. After 22. Qd4 Bh3 23. Qh4 (Black threatened 23. ... 
Rg2+ 24. Kh1 Rgf2 followed by mate on f1—if 23. Qd5+ then 23. ... Rf7 
with the idea of playing 24. ... Rf2 and White’s queen could not 
simultaneously control both f2 and g2), GM Boleslavsky recommends 
continuing with 23. ... Bg2, but it is also possible immediately to enter the 
technical phase of the game with 23. ... Rg2+ 24. Kh1 Rxa2, when best for 
White is 25. Qxh3 (25. Rxa2 Rf1 mate) 25. ... Rxa1+ 26. Kg2, but after 
26. ... Ra2+ 27. Kg1 Rf5 Black will have a winning advantage. If White 
does not take the rook on a2 or the bishop, then the bishop will be 
transferred via g2 or d7 to c6 with decisive effect—for example, 25. Re1 
Bg2+ 26. Kg1 Bc6 27. Qh3 Rf5, and White is completely helpless because 
the queen has to protect the g2-square and the rook has to protect the first 
rank. At the right moment, Black can go into a rook ending with two extra 
pawns by playing ... Rg2+.  
 
22. ...  
Bg2  
 
The threat is 23. ... Bc6 followed by ... Rg2+ and a deadly discovered 
check. On 23. Re1 Black could respond 23. ... Bh3 to achieve a winning 
pawn ending after the exchange of rooks on e1 and check on f1. If White 
responds 24. Rd1, then 24. ... Ref2 25. Qd3 Rf1+. The pawn ending is 
hopeless for White because his kingside pawns are disabled and Black has 
a healthy pawn majority on the other wing.

Take a moment to return to the starting diagram of this game (Alatortsev 
— Boleslavsky). We started out by saying that White’s kingside was 
weakened by the move g2-g3. But isn’t Black’s kingside also weakened? 
Why is Black winning in this position in spite of having the same type of 
weakness?  
The most important factor here is not the weakness itself, but the 
possibilities for exploiting the weakness. Black is well placed to take 
advantage of his opponent’s weak squares on the kingside in a way that 
White is not.  
White lost not only because his castled position was weakened, but also 
because the Black pieces worked well together in attacking White’s king. 
That means that the weaknesses of the squares h3 and g2 were not only 
real in a theoretical sense, but also played a decisive role in the dynamic 
struggle that followed.

The weakness of White’s position originates in White’s inability to create 
either attack or defense because his uncoordinated pieces are scattered all 
over the board. Make a simple change in the initial position — move the 
bishop from e2 to g2, for example — and the situation would immediately 
change. Now we can better understand the wisdom in Steinitz’s principle 
that we must act quickly or see our temporary advantages disappear.  
In this last example we saw a clear piece attack that became stronger with 
the help of a sacrifice. By making this sacrifice, Black opened the position 
of the enemy king even more, and the remaining pieces were sufficient for 
a winning attack.

Smyslov—Stahlberg

Position after Black’s 18th move  
 
The pawn structure near Black’s king is weakened, and Black lacks 
counterplay. These facts allow Smyslov quickly to create an attack, which 
after only a couple of moves brings him a decisive material advantage.

19. Qe3  
 
The strongest piece aims at the weakest square (h6) in Black’s position. 
Favoring White is 19. ... Nxc4 20. Qh6—for example, 20. ... Qe7 21. Rd3 
Kh8 (the threat was 22. Ne5, and 21. ... Nd6 will be followed by 22. Nh4 
Kh8 23. Rh3) 22. Nh4 Rd5 23. Nf5. Or if 20. ... Rd5 21. Re4 (stronger 
than 21. Qxf6, when Black has resources such as 21. ... Rf5 and 22. ...

Position after Black’s 15th move  
 
In evaluating this position, we can immediately notice the strong bishop at 
b2, striking unopposed at Black’s kingside. Black also has two potential 
weaknesses at c7 and e6.

On the other hand, it is not easy for White to exploit his opponent’s weak 
points, and the first player must also take care to guard his own weakness 
at d5.  
Is there a way for White to defend his d5-pawn without the exchange 
Bxf6, reducing his attacking chances? Alekhine found such a plan, 
allowing him to create additional weaknesses around Black’s king while 
retaining the powerful Bb2 for the attack.  
 
16. Bh3! 
 
This move indirectly protects the d-pawn, because 16. ... Nxd5? 17. Qxe4

Diagram 131

Black’s last move greatly increased the scope of the bishop on b2, and 
White can now think about attacking the Black king. But what plan should 
he follow, and how can he use weaknesses in the opponent’s position?  
White’s pieces are not yet sufficiently coordinated for an attack. So he 
must open up the game to increase the activity of his pieces, concentrating 
them in an attack on the opponent’s king.  
What should White do first? His bishop on b2 is definitely looking toward 
the kingside, but the position of his other bishop and the knight on h4 
could be improved by removing the f5-pawn that restricts them. Also, 
Black’s knight on e4 reduces the harmony of White’s forces — no active 
operations will be possible until this piece is driven back.  
In order to achieve these aims, White drives out the annoying knight with 
f3, and soon follows up with the thrust e2-e4. His plan leads to the 
immediate activation of his own pieces as well as the scattering of Black’s 
forces.  
 
17. f3

White not only clears the way for the advance of the e-pawn but also

the answer would be 19. Nxg6!.

If now 21. Bxg7, then 21. ... Nxg5 22. Bxf8 Nxh3+ 23. Kg2 Rxf8 24.

This move is the point. Black cannot take the bishop because of 23. Nxf5

f5-pawn is gone, and White not only keeps his main fighting piece (the

part in the attack.

Diagram 134  
 
 
 
Now there is no defense to 28. g5, so Black resigns.  
What can we say about the character of the attack in this example? What 
role did the White pawns play in it?  
White’s central pawn advance not only opened up the game for his two 
bishops, but also exposed Black’s king and made White’s pieces more

active. The forced weakness, g7-g6, was enough to create a winning piece 
attack. The final pawn advance g3-g4 was only the final tactical move. 
Pawns played a big part in White’s strategic plan, but they did not 
participate in weakening Black’s castled position, nor in the attack on the 
king.  
 
*    *    *    *    * 
 
So far we have seen examples in which piece attacks against weakened 
castled positions were made when both sides castled short. But how do we 
attack when both sides castle long?  
Basically there is no difference between these two kinds of attacks. The 
only important difference is that after castling long the king usually stays 
on c1 or c8. Attacks on the queenside castled position are usually easier to 
develop than a similar attack on the kingside. The explanation for this is 
that the pieces do not naturally protect the queenside pawns as well as they 
do the kingside pawns.  
In all of the games we have analysed so far, the active side succeeded by 
being better coordinated than the opponent. So far our examples have 
shown how to exploit big weaknesses in the opponent’s kingside. When 
the winning attack is carried out by pieces alone, a breakthrough is 
achieved by sacrifices to expose the enemy king.  
Before we examine piece attacks against a king whose pawn cover is 
strong, we would like to show you the tragic consequences of attacking 
from a position where the pieces are not acting in harmony, even though 
the opponent’s position contains pawn weaknesses.  
Unprepared attack

Diagram 135 
Capablanca — Becker 
Carlsbad, 1929  
 
 
 
Position after White’s 14th move  
 
White’s pawn position contains weaknesses — but can Black exploit 
them? We have already mentioned that pawn weaknesses should be 
treated only as one part of the overall picture.  
Think of it this way: What are the positive aspects of White’s position?  
First of all, it is not hard to see that White is completely mobilized, with 
all of his pieces on good squares. Black’s rooks are not ready for action. In 
addition White has the advantage in the center because he controls every 
square except d5.  
Black simply does not have a sufficiently aggressive placement of his 
pieces to launch a successful assault based on his structural advantage. 
Instead, Black should aim to hold the balance for now, and look for 
success in the endgame.  
Black could have continued 14. ... Qe7, with the idea of ... Rfd8, leading 
to a balanced game, but he decided instead to try to seize the initiative

with the hope of creating an attack. This mistaken idea quickly gives 
Black a losing game.  
 
14. ...  
Bb4  
 
Black wants to play ... Bxc3 followed by ... Qd5.  
 
15. Ne4  
Qd5  
 
Now after 16. Nxf6+ gxf6, Black will have a dangerous battery on the 
main diagonal. However, an attack in which only two pieces take part 
(queen and the bishop) can be easily defended by White’s superior forces.  
 
16. Nfg5! 
 
Diagram 136

Suddenly Black is in grave danger. White threatens 17. Nxf6+ gxf6 18. 
Be4, and the pawn on c7 is also under attack. Black does not have a 
satisfactory defense; for example, 16. ... Kh8 17. Rxc7 and the threat is not 
only 18. Bc4 winning the bishop, but also 18. Rxb7 Qxb7 19. Nxf6 gxf6 
20. Qh5 and checkmate.  
 
16. ...  
Ne8  
17. Nxh7!  
f5  
18. Nhg5!  
  
This is stronger than taking the rook. On 18. ... fxe4 White wins by 19. 
Bxe4; otherwise, White will play 19. Qh5 or 19. Bc4, so Black resigns. A 
very instructive example.  
Piece attacks against strong pawn structure 
Now let’s turn our attention to the topic of piece attacks against castled 
positions with no obvious weaknesses.  
Combination to increase activity

Euwe — Keres

Position after White’s 28th move  
 
White’s situation on the kingside looks very strong — he has more space 
and his king appears safe.  
Again, what is important is not the weaknesses themselves, but how well 
you can exploit them. In this particular situation, the weakness of Black’s 
pawns on the kingside is not a real problem for him. It would be a 
different story if the White bishop were on c2 instead of d4.  
Black starts with a small combination that allows his pieces to assume 
good attacking positions.

The initial combination is over, and now we can see how well the Black 
pieces work together. Black’s queen and knight are ready to attack g2, and 
the rook controls the open center file. Plus, Black’s advanced center pawn 
can support an invasion by his pieces.

Our study of piece attacks against a strong kingside pawn formation 
continues with another inspired example from Alekhine. This game is 
noteworthy, not only because of the former world champion’s excellent

The importance of greater activity in piece attacks 
So far we have seen that it is possible to lead a successful attack on a 
castled position that has no obvious weaknesses. When the attack involves 
only pieces, the activity of the attacker’s forces is the most important 
factor. Usually the active side either forces the opponent to weaken his 
king’s position and then develops an attack, or by sacrificing material the 
active side opens up the defending king’s position and then, with his 
remaining forces, lands the winning blow.  
So far we have seen only attacks with pieces. A natural question arises: 
Why didn’t pawns take part in the attack? The answer is that they did not 
do so because the character of the position did not require it.  
Open and closed positions 
If we carefully go back through the preceding positions, we would find 
that they were essentially open positions. In each case there were many 
open ranks, files, and diagonals providing pieces with great 
maneuverability. Also the center of the board was not blocked by pawns. 
This is in contrast to closed positions, where the center is often blocked by 
pawns and there are few, if any, open files.  
There are no absolute rules on how to distinguish between open and closed 
positions. However, with some experience, a chess player can determine 
whether the dominant character of the position is open or closed.  
In open positions, flank pawns are not usually advanced for attacking 
purposes, as demonstrated in the preceding examples.  
In conducting a piece attack using well coordinated forces, the active side 
in open positions does not need any extra opening of the game, and so the 
participation of pawns in the attack is unnecessary. This is one side of the 
question.  
Besides, in piece attacks involving castling on the same side, the attacker 
does not usually have to worry about his own king because he is protected 
by his pawns, and the activity of his own pieces on that flank will

probably eliminate any chances for counterattack. But if the pawns also 
participate in the attack, then the king’s position opens up, and the chance 
of a successful counterattack increases.  
Counterattack 
A counterattack can be very unpleasant for the attacker, especially when it 
involves the center, because pieces in the center are more active. So we 
must pay special attention to our control of the central squares when 
moving pawns in front of our own king. If the opponent has the possibility 
of taking direct action in the center, then pawn moves that open our own 
king will be much riskier.  
Therefore, if the kings are castled on the same side and one of the sides is 
attacking, the pawns join the attack only when the position is closed and it 
is hard for the opponent to organize a counterattack.  
Another important question is how to evaluate a counterattack on the other 
side of the board.  
Consider the following game situation: The center is closed, you are 
making a kingside attack by advancing pawns there, and your opponent is 
attacking the queenside (also by advancing pawns). Under some 
conditions he may be able to break through on the other side of the board 
before you do. This can create a difficult situation, because your opponent 
may invade your first two ranks with heavy pieces, and his invasion may 
create threats that are difficult to stop if your pieces are far away in 
attacking positions and unable to come to the defense.  
If we attack the enemy king using only one pawn rather than a full-scale 
pawn advance, the resulting weakness in our king’s position is diminished, 
and we decrease the chances of a successful counterattack. It is thus 
possible to attack using only one pawn when the position is open in 
character.  
Attacks in which only one pawn participates usually feature either a rook’s 
pawn or a bishop’s pawn. Advancing one of these pawns weakens our 
kingside slightly, but not nearly as much as if we advance the knight’s 
pawn. Moving the knight’s pawn creates more weak squares than the other 
pawns.

Again we emphasize that the decisive role in such situations is not played 
by the weaknesses themselves, but in how you take advantage of them. 
This is why the role of weaknesses can be different, depending on the 
concrete situation.  
In the next game, White started a strong attack on the king and sacrificed a 
pawn. Geller would have had good chances for success if Black had not 
made a timely counterattack on the queenside.  
Euwe employed two wonderful ideas: 1) Use the open lines from a 
queenside counterattack as the basis for an attack on the opponent’s 
kingside; and 2) Tempt the opponent’s pieces to advance with the idea of 
separating them from the defense of their own king. It is interesting to 
watch how White’s pieces move further and further into Black’s position, 
until they finally reach a point from which there is no coming back!

Black moved his knight to avoid being pinned by Bg5, and also to be able 
to reply to the move f3-f4 with ... f7-f5, blocking the kingside. That is 
why, before White moves his f-pawn, he takes the f5-square under control. 
There is no reason for White to worry about protecting the c4-pawn: in 
this sharp position, advancing on the kingside is more important. Besides, 
the c4-pawn was already doomed by White’s fifth move.

was necessary because otherwise White would advance his pawn to f6. In 
answer to ... Nxf6, White would pin the knight (Bc1-g5) and then open 
Black’s kingside. Now after 16. Rf4, White needs only two moves to 
transfer his queen and rook to the h-file, after which it looks like nothing 
will save the Black king.  
 
16. ...  
b5!

The beginning of an excellent plan. Any kind of defense on the kingside 
with moves like ... Rf7 or ... Qe7 is useless since these pieces have a very 
limited range of action. But Black has another plan — counterattack! The 
Black bishop on b7, the rook on c8, and the knight on c4 all occupy good 
squares. The only piece left out right now is the queen. The basis of the 
counterattack is Black’s control of the central dark squares. By playing ... 
b6-b5, Black makes his knight’s position more secure and opens a path for 
his queen to b6. But it looks like Black’s idea comes too late.  
 
17. Rh4  
Qb6  
 
By tying White’s queen to the defense of the d4 pawn, Black stops Qh5 
for the moment. But if instead White had played 17. Qh5 Qb6 18. Ne2 
Ne5, it would be too late to play 19. Rh4 because the bishop on d3 is 
under attack.

would not be good to play 20. exd7 because of 20. ... Qc6.  
 
20. ...

21. Qxh7+  
  
 
So by paying a small price, White has broken through. Black’s position

Black’s threat is checkmate in a couple of moves with 24. ... Rxg2+, 25. ... 
Qc4+, etc.  
 
24. Rac1 
 
A very difficult analysis shows that White could have avoided checkmate 
by making a couple of forced moves. He should have played 24. d5!; e.g. 
24. ... Qb6+ 25. Kh1 Qf2 26. Rg1 Bxd5 27. Re4!. If immediately 24. ... 
Bxd5, White plays 25. Rd1!, when after 25. ... Rxg2+ 26. Kf1 gxh6, the 
moves 27. Rxh6 or 27. Rxd5 are not good enough, so White’s best move 
is 27. Qxh6. But in any case, Black has a bishop and two pawns for the 
rook, giving him good chances for the win. It is understandable that Geller 
did not find these complex variations during the game.  
Subsequent analysis has proved that 22. ... Rh8 was premature, and that it 
would have been better to play 22. ... Rc4 first. However, chess lovers 
would probably not agree. Moves like 22. ... Rh8 are hard to forget!

Lesson Four 
Pawn Attacks with Same-Side Castling 
In this lesson we will give examples of attacks using pawns when the 
kings are castled on the same side. We will start with a position in which 
only one pawn takes part in the attack, and then we will move on to full-
scale pawn attacks. Along the way, we will note useful general principles.  
In the following examples, one or more pawns are used in the attack 
against the opponent’s king for one of two purposes: (1) to weaken the 
position of the king, or (2) to open up lines for the attacker’s pieces. 
Sometimes the pawn advance accomplishes both goals.  
We are not going to consider here positions where pawns are used to 
create protected outpost squares for the pieces and do not play an active 
attacking role themselves (a very common situation). For example, in the 
Dutch Defense (1. d4 f5), a Black knight usually occupies the e4-square, 
protected by the f5-pawn. And in many variations of the Ruy Lopez (1. e4 
e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5), a White knight often goes to f5, where it is 
supported by the e4-pawn and also sometimes by pawns on h3 and g4.

Attacking with one pawn 
Creating a weakness 
Diagram 155 
Reti — Alekhine 
Baden-Baden, 1925  
 
 
 
Position after White’s 20th move  
 
White controls the half open c-file on the queenside. If he could open it 
completely and occupy it with heavy pieces, he would gain a clear 
advantage. In addition, removing the c6-pawn takes away the supporter of 
the knight on d5, and provides more space for White’s fianchettoed 
bishop, which is pointed toward the queenside.  
How can White open the c-file?  
The standard plan in cases like this is the pawn advance b2-b4-b5. If Black 
exchanges pawns on b5, then White’s goal of opening the c-file would be 
reached. But if Black does not capture, White will take on c6, and Black 
will be left with a weak c6-pawn which will become a target. Black can 
delay the move b4-b5 by playing ... a7-a6, but then White plays a2-a4 with 
the idea of playing b4-b5 anyway. In chess literature, White’s advance is

known as the minority attack, where two pawns attack the opposing chain 
of three pawns.  
What can Black do? Should he just wait passively for his opponent’s 
queenside initiative to develop? Of course not! That means that he must 
make a plan on the other side of the board, because he does not have the 
option of attacking in the center. Black would accomplish nothing with a 
piece attack on the kingside because he does not have enough pieces there, 
and White’s castled position is fairly strong.  
The right idea for Black in this position is to weaken the position of 
White’s king and then to attack it. Black plans h7-h5-h4-hxg3 in order to 
reduce the number of pawns sheltering the White king by exchanging. So, 
in this case the reason for advancing the rook’s pawn is not to open up a 
file, but to weaken the opponent’s kingside.  
Even if Black achieves this goal, however, it is hard to see how he will 
benefit from it. We will follow Alekhine’s play, and learn how to make 
use of such a weakness.  
 
20. ...  
h5!  
21. b4  
  
 
We should also add that 21. e4 limits the bishop on h1 and does not give 
White anything real—for example, 21. ... Nb6 22. Qc3 Nbd7.  
 
21. ...

because the a1-rook would be unprotected.

The pawn protection of the White king has been slightly weakened, but 
Black has no specific threats right now. It looks like he cannot even dream 
about making a successful attack. Thus, White pays attention only to his 
own plan. But in retrospect, we should say that 25. e4 was better.

example: 35. Rd8+ Kh7 36. Rh1+ Kg6 37. Rh3 Rfb3, etc.  
After 31. Rxe2 Rxe2 all the action would still be on one flank. But being 
the Exchange ahead in these kinds of positions makes it easier to win than 
having a queen against a rook and piece.

Black has won a pawn. But since the action is taking place on only one 
side of the board, trying to win by simplifying the position is rather 
problematic. Many endgames like this end as a draw, so Black continues 
to attack.

Opening a file 
Diagram 162 
Lasker — Capablanca 
Moscow, 1935  
 
 
 
Position after Black’s 18th move  
 
White’s position is better. All of his pieces are on good squares. At the 
same time Black suffers from a misplaced queen on a5 and a bishop on d7 
that does not have much of a future. After the eventual exchange of dark-
squared bishops, the position of Black’s king will be seriously weakened.  
This situation suggests a kingside attack. White can transfer his queen and 
a rook to the kingside by using the e-file, after which he will have all of 
his pieces participating in the attack.  
We should also point out that Black does not have the possibility of a 
counter-attack on either the queenside or the center. That is why White 
does not hurry with a piece attack, but instead starts by moving his rook’s 
pawn. By a similar pawn advance in the previous example, Alekhine 
weakened the position of his opponent’s king, but the open file was not a 
factor in the struggle. In this case, by moving the rook’s pawn forward,

White not only weakens the position of the Black king but also prepares to 
use the open file in the attack.  
 
19. h4! 
Qd8 
 
It is bad to play 19. ... h5, because of 20. Bxg6 fxg6 21. Qxg6 Re7 22. 
Rd3, with a winning attack for White. Black moves his queen to the 
defense, because the threat is 20. h5 followed by an exchange of pawns 
and the sacrifice of the bishop on g6. This threat could have been 
prevented by 19. ... f5, but in that case Black’s position would further 
deteriorate because of the weak pawn on e6.

playing 22. Bc4 Qxh5 23. Rde1. This threatens 24. Qb3, after which

White would win back the pawn and keep his positional advantage 
because the e-file will be in his hands, and the position of the Black king 
will remain unsafe.

Activating every piece 
Diagram 167 
Botvinnik — Vidmar 
Nottingham, 1936  
 
 
 
Position after Black’s 16th move  
 
Black’s position seems fairly safe. White’s queen, knight and bishops can 
operate on the kingside, but Black’s kingside pawn formation is strong. It 
looks like White can’t break through.  
White has an isolated d-pawn, and if the game is simplified White will 
have to worry about protecting it. The most logical plan for White in such 
a position is a kingside attack. However, by using only the pieces currently 
in play it will be difficult to mount a successful assault. White’s rooks 
currently do not play an active role, so he should think about activating 
them. Botvinnik finds the idea of opening the f-file.

We have already mentioned that attacking with the knight’s pawn weakens 
one’s own position and runs a high risk of counterattack. The knight pawn 
usually attacks together with the rook pawn or the bishop pawn. The 
following game illustrates such an attack.

Wing thrust vs. central counterplay 
Diagram 173 
Unzicker — Reshevsky 
International Tournament, 1958 
 
 
 
Position after Black’s 15th move  
 
First let’s try to determine the character of the position. Is it open or 
closed? This kind of evaluation here can be only approximate.  
For now there are no open files, but there are also no pawn chains, which 
would give the game more of a closed character. In our opinion this 
position should not be classified as truly open, but it is more open than 
closed.  
What plan should White adopt? On which side of the board can he become 
active? Can he be active on the queenside? No, because Black is stronger 
on this part of the board.  
Who stands better in the center? White currently controls the central 
squares e4 and d5, but we also have to consider that Black has two center 
pawns (a precondition for a possible attack in the center).

The right conclusion is that White should play on the kingside. It is rather 
difficult to prepare a piece attack there, but White has a majority of pawns 
on the kingside, which suggests a pawn attack.  
 
16. g4 
 
White starts a pawn attack on the kingside with the help of the g-pawn. 
Although moving this pawn weakens the position of the White king, in the 
given situation Black is not able to exploit this weakening.  
White’s basic plan is to play 17. g5, followed by moving his knight to the 
central square d5. Occupying this strong square stops Black’s chances of 
seizing the initiative in the center. After occupying the central outpost on 
d5, White would continue the pawn attack on the kingside so as to open 
lines for a piece attack.  
 
16. ... 
e4  
 
Since it is not possible to stop g4-g5, Reshevsky strikes in the center, 
sacrificing a pawn. While Black’s plan does not succeed in this particular 
game, we must say that his idea is logical and correct. It fails simply 
because White was better and played correctly.

23. Qg2

Now the knight also guards the d5-square. White’s obvious threats are 
defended against; however, he can continue the attack on the kingside 
(which was interrupted by Black’s counterattack in the center).  
 
24. g5  
 
The threat is to open lines with 25. g6. These would be very dangerous for 
Black because of the White queen on the g-file and the White rook on the

7th rank. That is why with his next move Black tries to exchange this 
active rook.

Attacking with multiple pawns 
Now let’s consider positions in which the attack on the king is made by 
using all the kingside pawns.  
Space advantage 
Diagram 178 
Gereban — Smyslov 
Moscow, 1949  
 
 
 
Position after White’s 21st move  
 
Black has a majority of pawns on the queenside, and White must blockade 
them because otherwise they will become a serious threat. The need to 
maintain this blockade prevents White from seeking active play, which 
gives Black the advantage. In addition, Black’s pieces have greater 
maneuverability.  
Considering the fact that the center is not open and the position has a 
closed character, Smyslov decided to start a pawn advance on the

kingside, with the idea of opening the files for his pieces and weakening 
the position of the White king.  
 
21. ...

22. Nc2 
  
 
On 22. Bd6 Black could answer 22. ... Qd8 and 23. ... Bf8.  
 
22. ... 
Nf7 
 
The immediate 22. ... f4 is not possible because of 23. Bd6. But Black has 
no need to hurry. First of all he improves the position of his pieces.  
 
23. Be7 
 
White clears the b4-square for his knight, intending to put pressure on the 
d5-pawn. By exchanging bishops, Black takes away possible counterplay.

Now the d-pawn is strongly protected. But before continuing with the 
pawn attack on the kingside, Black improves the positions of his pieces.  
 
27. g3

This move weakens White’s castled position, but he wants to reposition 
the bishop to g2 where it will put some pressure on the d5-pawn. In a 
couple of moves Black will prepare ... f5-f4, which has become more 
difficult to play after g2-g3. So we cannot really say that 27. g3 helps 
Black to open files for an attack.

White cannot solve his problems by exchanging his bishop for the strong, 
centralized knight, because after 30. Bxe4 fxe4 his kingside is bare.  
Black has finished improving the placement of his pieces, and is ready to

for defense. White probably also thought that the weakened e5-square

In this situation it would not be good to open the f-file because after 21.

The threat was f5-f6+ followed by Qc3-d2-h6. It would not be good to

very weak. Now White will play Ne2-c3-d5, followed by Rf2 and Rbf1. 
The goal of this plan is to make Black play ... g6-g5, giving White the 
means to open the h-file for the decisive attack.  
 
22. Qd2

It is important to note that White was able to prepare his attack slowly and 
calmly because the position was closed and stable.  
When the kings are castled on the same side, advancing the pawns in front 
of one’s own king must not be rushed. This caution is easy to 
understand—preparation is required before you can open files leading to 
your own king. But if the kings have castled in different directions, then 
the pawn attack can occur very rapidly, as we will see in lesson five.

Position after Black’s 26th move  
 
In this example, two out of the three white kingside pawns will take part in 
the attack. In evaluating this position, it’s important to notice White’s 
advantage in the location of his forces. His pieces have a lot of room to 
maneuver. Since the position on both the queenside and in the center has a 
closed character, White starts an attack on the kingside in which pawns 
play a big role.

If Black could take direct action in the center, his bishop pair might 
become a factor. But weakening the position of the White king (by 
advancing the kingside pawns) is not significant here because Black does 
not have any such counterplay.  
 
27. h4! 
White plans to move his bishop to b1 and then to create mate threats on 
the b1-h7 diagonal. The pawn move discourages potential defense by ...

Queenside counterplay 
Diagram 194 
Bisguier — Petrosian 
New York, 1954  
 
 
 
Position after Black’s 17th move  
 
Black’s queenside attack has been a success so far, and at the same time 
White does not yet have an attack in the center or on the kingside. How 
should White continue the struggle? What plan should he choose?  
If we look carefully at the position, our attention will be drawn to the 
move g3-g4, because White’s best chances are on the kingside. White 
cannot “stand still,” since that means gradually giving away important 
squares to his opponent. However, we think that after 18. g4 Nd7 19. g5 
Nc5 20. h4 Rd8, Black’s chances are better because it is difficult for 
White to make progress on the kingside, while Black could start active 
operations on the queenside. But after 18. g4, the struggle would be very 
sharp.  
 
18. Rab1

White moves the rook so that after 18. ... a3 he can play 19. Ba1, keeping 
the bishop on the long diagonal. However, there is no reason for Black to 
close the queenside with ... a4-a3 if it does not bring an immediate 
advantage, since all his chances lie in creating an initiative on the 
queenside. After 18. g4 a3 19. Bc1, White would not have to worry about 
the queenside and could then turn his full attention to kingside activity.  
So 18. Rb1 is ineffective: White prevents ... a4-a3, a move that Black 
would not play anyway, and White gives away the open a-file to his 
opponent, who will use it to invade the second rank.

It would be better to play 22. h4 if White decided to attack the king. 
However, Black’s rook occupies such a strong position on a2 that White’s 
chances for a successful pawn attack are small. How can White evict the 
rook from a2? He can play 22. Nf3 Nc5 23. Qc2, preparing 24. Ra1, but 
after 23. ... Bb7 24. Ra1 R8a8 Black is still better.

Solutions 
1. Marshall — Wolf, Nuremberg, 1906. White has everything prepared for 
an attack on the Black king. His bishops on b2 and b1 and the knight at g5 
are active, and bringing the queen into play will make the attack 
unstoppable. This example supports our general rule that it is important to 
involve as many pieces as possible in the attack. 1. Qh5! f6 (of course not 
1. ... gxh5 2. Bh7 mate) 2. Bxg6 Rd7 3. Nxe6 Black resigns. 
2. Levitsky — Marshall, Breslau, 1912. Black has a material advantage, 
but two of his pieces are under attack. Still, Marshall’s heavy pieces can 
use the half-open files to launch a winning attack. Black makes use of 
several pins to create a combination. 1. ... Qg3!. After this White can only 
resign — he has no saving moves. For example, 2. hxg3 Ne2 mate or 2. 
fxg3 Ne2+ 3. Kh1 Rxf1 mate, and after 2. Qxg3 Ne2+ 3. Kh1 Nxg3+ 4. 
Kg1 Nxf1 5. gxh3 Nd2 Black wins easily.  
3. Alekhine — Seleznyev, Bad Pistyan, 1922. This is a fragment from the 
game analysis. Here White could have unleashed 1. Nxg6! hxg6 2. Rxe6! 
(to open more files) 2. ... fxe6 3. Qxg6+ Kh8 4. Bc2, followed by mate in 
a few moves—for example, 4. ... Rf5 5. Rd3, etc.  
4. Lerner — Razuvayev, Frunze, 1979. 1. Rd6!. By means of a 
combination, White brings his rook into the attack. The preconditions for 
an attack are clear: Black’s king is open, the bishop on b2 is ready for 
action on the long diagonal, the queen is ready to make threats, and the 
knight on e5 is well placed. White intends to answer 1. ... Bxd6 with 2. 
Ng4! when Black’s weakness on the long diagonal, especially on f6, will 
be fatal. 1. ... Bc8 2. Qg5+ Kh7. Now go to position number 5.  
5. Lerner — Razuvayev, Frunze, 1979. Continued from the previous 
position (after 1. Rd6! Bc8 2. Qg5+ Kh7). 3. Nd7!. This is a wonderful 
move of great artistic merit since the knight can be captured four ways. If 
now 3. ... Bxd7 4. Rxf6 Bxf6 5. Bxf6, and now the only defense to Qg7 
mate is 5. ... Rg8, which allows 6. Qxh5 mate. And 3. ... Rxd7 leads to the 
same predicament, while 3. ... Nxd7 4. Qg7 is mate. That leaves only 3. ... 
Qxd7. Now 4. Rxf6 fails to 4. ... Bxf6 5. Bxf6 Qg4!, but the game

concluded after 4. Rxd7 Bxd7 5. Bxf6 Bxf6 6. Qxf6 Rxc4 7. Qe7 Black 
resigns.  
6. Ivanchuk — Yudasin, Riga, 1991. Black has completely taken over the 
queenside; however, there are no easy targets left there. Black’s pieces are 
misplaced and cannot aid his lonely king, who can only watch as lines 
open up and the enemy invades. 1. e6 fxe6 2. Qe4 and Black resigns 
because he cannot defend against White’s threats.  
7. Ivanchuk — Kasparov, Linares, 1991. White’s advanced pawns, 
together with the disharmony in Black’s position, play an important role in 
the attack. 1. Rg4! This stops Black’s queen from making a counterattack. 
1. ... exf5 2. Nf4 Qh8. Now both king and queen are trapped. 3. Qf6+ Kh7 
4. Rxh4+ and mate next move, so Black resigns.  
8. Speelman — Kudrin, Hastings, 1983-4. White has an open h-file, with 
his rook opposing Black’s king. A couple of elegant preparatory moves 
make the position ready for a standard but beautiful combination: 1. Bc2+ 
Kg8 2. Rh5 Qf4 3. g3 Qf6 4. Bh7+ Kh8 5. Bg6+ and Black resigns 
because of 5. ... Kg8 6. Rh8+!! Kxh8 7. Qh5+ Kg8 (the bishop on g6 
interferes with the queen’s defense of h6) 8. Qb7 mate.  
9. Kramnik — Kasparov, Novgorod, 1997. 1. Nc7!. The knight joins the 
attack, and it can’t be taken. (If 1. ... Qxc7? 2. Qxh6+ Kxh6 3. Rh3 
checkmate!) The Black queen is overworked. Kramnik remarked: “Back 
in my childhood I was taught that such a motif is called overloading.” 1. ... 
Rxa4 2. Bxf4 Black resigns, because after 2. ... Bxf4 3. Ne6, Black loses 
in all lines — not surprising, with two Black pieces “missing in action” far 
off on the queenside. For example, if Black tries 3. ... Rg8, then 4. Rxg8 
Qxg8 (or 4. ... Kxg8 5. Rxf4 with a rapid mate) 5. Qf5+ Kh8 6. Qf6+ Kh7 
7. Nf8+, winning the queen.  
10. Kasparov — Yusupov, USSR Championship, 1981. Black’s knight on 
c8 is temporarily out of the game, and Black’s extra pawn will mean little 
if White develops a kingside attack. 1. Ne4! fxe4 (or else White will play 
Nf6) 2. f5!. (Threatening to trap the rook with f5-f6, but Black cannot take 
the pawn because of 3. Qxf5+, followed by mate.) 2. ... Rg5 3. Rxg5 hxg5 
4. f6 and White is winning. The remaining moves were 4. ... Kh6 5. fxe7 
Qxe7 6. Bf7 d6 7. Rf1 g4 8. Bxe6 Qxe6 9. Qh4+ and Black lost on time.

11. Averbakh — Kotov, Zurich, 1953. 1. ... Qxh3+!!. Sacrificing the queen 
for a pawn is quite rare in practice. Now after this thunderbolt, the king 
must make a dangerous journey while under fire from all Black’s pieces. 
At the same time White’s entire army is cut off by the wall of pawns and 
cannot rescue its king. 2. Kxh3 Rh6+ 3. Kg4 Nf6+ 4. Kf5. Here Black 
was so excited by his queen sacrifice that he played 4. ... Nd7 and went on 
to win, missing 4. ... Ng4!, which would have been immediately 
conclusive.  
12. Bogolyubov, Reti, and Spielmann — Englund, Jakobson, Nikholm, and 
Olson, Consultation game, Stockholm, 1919. 1. h4!. White has a very 
active position with pressure against f7. By moving his h-pawn he intends 
to drive the Black bishop away from defending the critical square. 1. ... 
Bc2. (Other continuations were no better: 1. ... Rae8 2. h5 Bc2 3. Qxf7+ 
Rxf7 4. Rxf7 Qxd4+ 5. Rf2+ Qxc4 6. Rxe8 mate, or 2. ... Rxe5 3. dxe5 
Bxh5 4. e6 Qe7 5. Qe5.) 2. Qe3 Rad8 (on 2. ... Rae8 follows 3. Rxf7 Rxf7 
4. Rxe8+) 3. Rxf7 Rxf7 4. Re7 Qc8 5. Rxf7 Kh8 6. Rxg7!. The final 
blow, exposing the king. Black resigns since 6. ... Kxg7 7. Qe7+ is mate 
in two.

Part III: 
Attacks with Opposite-Side Castling  
Lesson Five 
Attacks with Opposite-Side Castling 
When the kings are castled on opposite sides of the board, a very sharp 
and complex battle often arises. Both sides try to develop a swift attack, 
and whoever outraces the opponent usually obtains the advantage. In such 
attacks, the rapid advance of pawns often plays an important role. Pawn 
exchanges can clear a path for the attacking forces, and the advance of 
attacking pawns can also create weak points that the attacker can exploit.  
But simply moving pawns toward the enemy king does not necessarily 
create favorable attacking conditions. Castling on opposite sides creates a 
dynamic situation with two fighting fronts in which the most significant 
factors are (1) time, (2) the initiative, and (3) conformity to general 
principles of positional play. Also very important are (4) controlling the 
center, (5) superior development, and (6) having an advantage in attacking 
force near the enemy king. These six factors are the best way to evaluate 
the attacking chances for each side.  
There are many classical examples of attacks with the kings on opposite 
flanks. Paul Morphy’s games, for example, contain many instructive 
examples.

Some commentators have remarked at this point that Black’s win is just a 
“matter of technique.” It’s true that White’s position is indefensible: Not 
only is he a pawn down, but he also has weak pawns on the kingside, and 
the open b-file provides Black with splendid attacking chances. The open 
g-file is meaningless because Black has more space on the kingside as 
well. Nevertheless, Black’s next two moves, which at first seem totally 
irrational, are not easy to find.

This transfer of the queen is made possible by Black’s rook on the b-file.

On the basis of material alone, one would now declare White the winner, 
but this would be a mistake. In this position the important action is on the 
queenside, where the coordinated activity of Black’s remaining forces 
matters more than White’s overall advantage in material. White’s king 
cannot escape, and his extra rook cannot protect him.

Position after Black’s 10th move  
The Black king is surrounded by many pawns. However, the pawns on a6 
and c6 give White the possibility of creating a pawn attack by playing b4, 
a4 and b5 after proper preparation. Neither side has any play on the 
kingside or in the center.

11. Rab1 
This begins the attack. White prepares b2-b4.  
 
11. ...

Black wants to use f7 to bring his knight to the defense, especially since 
the knight on h6 is not doing anything useful. Trying to stop b2-b4 with 
11. ... c5 does not work because White will continue 12. Nd5 and 13. b4.

It is the opponent’s pawn weaknesses that make a successful pawn storm 
possible — the most common plan of attack when the kings are castled on 
opposite sides. When White castles long and Black castles short, for 
example, the placement of a pawn at g6 (or b3) encourages the opponent 
to advance with h2-h4-h5 (or ... a7-a5-a4), either sacrificing or exchanging 
the h-pawn (or a-pawn), so that a file will be opened for the attack.  
The following examples illustrate the theme of attack on the h- and a-files 
when there is opposite-side castling. This kind of attack is common in 
modern openings such as the Saemisch Attack in the King’s Indian 
Defense, the Yugoslav Attack in the Dragon Sicilian, and various lines in 
the Pirc and Modern Defenses. In these and many other openings, Black 
plays ... g7-g6 and ... Bf8-g7, placing his dark-squared bishop on the long

a1-h8 diagonal in a maneuver known as a “fianchetto” (FEE-an-KET-to). 
Often White will play Be3 (or Bg5) followed by Qd2, so that at a 
favorable moment, White can play Bh6 and Bxg7, exchanging the 
fianchettoed bishop, which is Black’s most important kingside defender.  
Attacking the fianchetto

White intends to attack on the kingside, where Black must castle sooner or

Diagram 239  
Boleslavsky — Geller  
Zurich, 1953  
 
 
 
Position after Black’s 10th move  
 
11. g4  
 
The opening phase of the game has just ended, and White immediately 
starts to advance his pawns on the kingside. His main idea is to play h2-
h4-h5 to open the h-file for his heavy pieces.

The position is somewhat similar to the previous one. In our opinion this 
position is slightly better for Black because he has good chances of 
creating a counterattack on the c-file.  
We should pay attention to White’s opportunities for playing Bh6 with the 
idea of exchanging Black’s bishop on g7. Is this kind of exchange useful 
to the attacking side? Yes, because by getting the fianchettoed bishop out 
of the way, White weakens the position of Black’s king.  
Then why did White not play 11. Bh6? Because Black would answer 11. 
... Nxd4 12. Bxg7 Nxf3 winning material. And if first White exchanges 
knights with 11. Nxc6 then after 11. ... bxc6 Black has more control in the 
center and also gains the possibility of attacking the weak b2-square on the 
open b-file.  
 
11. ...  
Rc8  
 
Should Black try to stop the White pawns with 11. ... h5?  
No — 11. ... h5 weakens the kingside and does not prevent the opening of 
a file. White would continue 12. gxh5 Nxh5 13. Rg1, after which the nasty 
threat of 14. Nf5! would give White a very strong attack.  
 
12. Kb1 
 
This is a standard move in this kind of position. Often the a2-pawn needs 
another protector, especially after Black plays ... Qa5. But in this position 
there is no immediate need for Kb1, so 12. h4 deserves attention.  
 
12. ...

After 13. Bh6 play might continue 13. ... Bxh6 14. Qxh6 Rxc3 15. bxc3

initiative and White’s castled position would be seriously weakened.  
 
13. ...  
b5  
 
It is not easy for Black to create counterplay. After 13. ... Nc4 14. Bxc4 
Rxc4, White would continue his plan with 15. h5. Black’s last move 
prepares ... Nc4 and in case of an exchange Black would be able to take on 
c4 with the pawn, and then concentrate his attack on the b2-pawn. Of 
course Black can also move the b-pawn forward.  
 
Diagram 240 
 
 
 
The Black pawn on b5 is attacked three times. Could White just take it?  
GM David Bronstein in his comments about this game wrote: “It would be 
insane to take the pawn on b5.”  
We agree with the spirit of Bronstein’s comment — 13. ... b5 is a typical 
positional sacrifice, and that is why Geller did not spend his time on 
lengthy calculations prior to making this move. He just used his intuition

and experience with these types of positions. Again, let’s check some 
sample lines:  
(1) 14. Bxb5 Bxb5 15. Ncxb5 a6 16. Na3 (if 16. Nc3, then 16. ... Nc4 and 
17. ... Qb6) 16. ... Rb8 and Black has a good position for the pawn — the 
threat is 17. ... Nxf3 18. Nxf3 Nxe4.  
(2) 14. Ncxb5 Rb8 (with the threat 15. ... Nxf3 and taking aim at the b2-
square).

occurred in the game.

after the exchange of queens Black’s attack will evaporate, and an extra 
Exchange in a simplified position starts to play a big role. In the endgame 
one pawn might not turn out to be enough material compensation for the 
Exchange.

We have seen a couple of examples where a pawn attack was launched on 
a weakened castled position. The potential weakenings associated with the 
moves h6 (h3) and g6 (g3) are typical and are very common in practice.  
The next example shows a similar attack on the a-file in which the White 
king perishes because of exploitable weaknesses in his pawn cover.

Black’s intentions are clear: He will advance his a-pawn, because the

Of course! Black doesn’t want to waste a single tempo in his attack. 
Capturing the bishop is bad, since 18. fxe6 fxe6 opens the f-file for 
Black’s rook with gain of time.  
In situations like this, with sharp play for both sides, the most important 
factor is gaining the initiative. Most players would stop analyzing after 18. 
fxe6 fxe6 19. Qg3 (19. Qe3? Bg5 wins the queen) 19. ... Bh4, sensing that 
gaining the initiative was worth the material investment. This intuition 
would be correct since after 20. Qh2 Rf2 21. Rhe1 Bg5+, White will soon

Sometimes in positions with castling on opposite sides the pawn storm 
does not manage to open files against the enemy king, but instead creates 
weak squares in the opponent’s pawn structure. The following game 
shows the exploitation of an open diagonal.

Now let’s analyse an attack against a strong castled position. We will 
consider a classic example where White has a pawn majority on the 
kingside, while Black has a queenside majority.

If 25. ... Nc3+, then simply 26. bxc3.

26. e6

Diagram 260 
 
 
 
27. Ka1 
This is the easiest way, but the bishop could also be taken: 27. Rxe4 Rd1+ 
28. Kc2 Qa4+ 29. b3.  
 
27. ... 
f5 
28. e7+ 
Rd5 
29. Qf6 
Qf7 
30. e8=Q+ 
Black resigns. 
 
White won because he correctly gained the initiative by advancing his 
pawn majority on the kingside, giving him the possibility of leading an 
energetic attack. Black did not have an equivalent source of counterplay.

11. Keres — Botvinnik, USSR Championship, 1941. When White castled 
long he underestimated the power of opening the c-file. His opponent soon 
enlightened him: 1. ... g5 2. Bg3 cxd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 4. Qa4 Bf5. (Now the 
king can’t run to a1.) 5. e3 Rc8 6. Bd3 Qd7. (Threatens discovered

an interstate highway for White’s pieces!

Conclusion 
After considering these many examples illustrating the attack on the 
king, we would like to make the following observations.  
We think you will agree with us that in chess, an attack is not only a bit of 
fantasy, a creative work of the imagination, but is also a logical process 
which makes use of specific chess knowledge and facts, such as the basic 
elements of combinations and attacking strategems. In this volume, we 
have concentrated on presenting various broad categories of attacking 
formations. For a detailed discussion of the most common tactical devices, 
please see the previous book in this series, Chess Tactics for the 
Tournament Player.  
We believe that these basic skills (such as making combinations and 
recognizing attacking schemes) can be effectively learned.  
Our intention was to provide players of intermediate strength with an 
introduction to the fundamental principles that underlie any successful 
attack on the king. It is true that positions sometimes arise in which the 
attack goes outside the classification scheme used in this book. It would 
not be hard to find games in which some of our general conclusions might 
not apply. In most cases, however, our general principles will help players 
to understand more about the ebb and flow of the chess struggle. We 
emphasize that this book is not intended as a comprehensive theory of 
attack, and that we have only presented the most basic type of examples as 
a way of introducing the subject. Our next book in the Comprehensive 
Chess Course series, Chess Strategy for the Tournament Player, continues 
to discuss the relationship between tactical devices and the overall 
strategic content of the position.  
It is important to point out that attacks and combinations are not possible 
in every position. Recall the advice of Steinitz: Attacks should be prepared 
carefully, through the accumulation of small advantages. First of all, the 
pieces should be developed quickly and efficiently, either by occupying 
the center or at least establishing some control over it. Successful control 
of the center will guarantee that you have more space, more 
maneuverability for your pieces, and thus the preconditions for a

successful attack. By considering the plans and opportunities for both 
sides and making an objective evaluation of the position, you will be able 
to choose the correct plan and determine the right direction for developing 
an attack. However, as we have already seen, a decisive combination is 
possible only when the opponent’s position is weakened, or when the 
harmony between the enemy’s pieces is disrupted.  
Keep in mind that by deploying your forces actively, seizing greater space, 
opening lines, bringing superior force to the main battleground, and 
creating weaknesses in the enemy camp, you can guide your ship of attack 
into the port of victory. Imagination, bravery, practice, and acquiring new 
knowledge and experience guarantee you happy sailing!  
Remember: If you have a temporary advantage in development or 
mobility, you must attack or else you will lose your advantage.  
To this general rule, we can add an important corollary. If you believe that 
you have the better position, you must be able to state why that is so in 
words. Only when you have a firm grasp of why you stand better (if that is 
the case) can you move on to the more concrete task of implementing the 
attack. If you can’t say why you stand better, you probably don’t!  
The practical player must constantly be on the alert for opportunities to 
recognize the sort of advantages that may lead to a successful attack. To 
reinforce this principle, the next time you are conducting a winning attack, 
stop for a moment and notice how many of these smaller advantages are 
present in the position just prior to the decisive blow.  
You will undoubtedly want to return to some of the examples and 
conclusions about each general type of position. These examples will help 
to guide you as you conduct your own attacks in tournament and casual 
games.  
By increasing your understanding of various attacking methods, by 
recognizing the wisdom of accumulating smaller advantages before 
launching an attack, and by learning how to make combinations, you will 
soon be feeling more confident as a player. As your mastery of these 
principles increases, so will your tournament successes.

International Grandmaster Lev 
Alburt 
Grandmaster Lev Alburt was born in Orenburg, Russia, on August 21, 
1945. For many years, he lived in Odessa, a Ukrainian city located on the 
Black Sea. A three-time champion of the Ukraine (1972-74), he became 
European Cup champion in 1976. In 1979, while in West Germany for a 
chess competition, he defected and came to the US, making his home in 
New York City.  
 
Mentored by three-time World Champion and eminent teacher Mikhail 
Botvinnik, Grandmaster Alburt first taught chess in the Soviet Union. He 
is now in the forefront of the innovative movement known as “the new 
chess pedagogy,” which seeks new ways to teach chess to both beginners 
and more advanced players, regardless of their ages or backgrounds. GM 
Alburt’s Comprehensive Chess Course is one of the most important works 
of this movement.  
GM Alburt has won the U.S. Championship an impressive three times—in 
1984, 1985, and 1990. He is known as the “Grandmaster of chess 
teachers.” He is the only top-echelon GM to devote his career to teaching 
those below master strength.  
Currently, GM Alburt is a popular columnist for Chess Life, a best-selling 
chess author, and a renowned teacher. He provides lessons through-the-
mail, over-the-telephone, and face-to-face. Write to GM Alburt at P.O.

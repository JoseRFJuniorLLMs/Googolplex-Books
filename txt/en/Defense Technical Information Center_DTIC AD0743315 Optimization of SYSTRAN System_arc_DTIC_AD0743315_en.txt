ABSTRACT 


This  report  describes  an  optimization  phase  of  the  opera¬ 
tional  machine  translation  system  designed  by  LATSEC,  INC.,  and 
designated  SYSTRAN.  The  most  distinctive  characteristic  of 
SYSTRAN  is  the  absence  of  pre-editing.  Whenever  SYSTRAN'S 
operation  is  initiated  on  the  computer,  it  reads  in 
tapes  containing  raw  and  unedited  Russian  texts,  carries  out 
dictionary  and  table  lookups,  performs  all  syntactic  analysis 
procedures,  and  prints  out  translated  texts  without  human  di¬ 
rection.  Optimization  during  this  phase  was  primarily  focussed, 
as  directed  in  the  Work  Statement,  on  update  and  correction. 

The  former  task  included  further  development  of  homograph  rou¬ 
tines,  improved  handling  of  adnominal  genitives,  numbers,  proper 
names,  abbreviations,  sequences  of  tenses,  and  adverbs  and  so¬ 
phistication  of  article  insertion,  in  addition  to  the  larger 
task  of  implementing  the  Segment  Analyzer  Program.  The  latter 
task,  dictionary  optimization,  was  directed  at  correcting  human 
errors,  using  special  dictionary  print  programs  to  pinpoint 
errors  in  existing  entries,  and  at  updating  the  dictionary, 
using  diagnostic  messages  provided  by  the  computer  during  update 
to  prohibit  introduction  of  new  errors.  These  messages  indicate 
specific  reasons  for  rejecting  invalid  transactions.  Optimi¬ 
zation  in  the  area  of  semantics  was  limited,  since  the  major 
emphasis  of  the  Work  Statement  were  dictionary  and  parsing 
improvement.  The  optimization  effected  improves  the  handling 
of  polysemantic  lexical  items  by  examining  their  context.  This 


iii 


j  report,  however,  reflects  SYSTRAN'S  readiness  to  incorporate 

j  greater  semantic  advances  and  describes  directions  which  seman 

|  tic  optimization  must  necessarily  take  in  the  future.

TECHNICAL  EVALUATION 


Final  Technical  Report,  "Optimization  of  SYSTRAN  System"  on  Contract 
F30602-7T -C-0091  ,  LATSEC,  Inc. 

The  optimization  effort  described  in  subject  report  consisted 
of  the  following  tasks  in  order  of  descending  emphasis:  (1)  veri¬ 
fication  and  modification  for  inclusion  in  the  SYSTRAN  dictionary 
system  of  (a)  an  additional  50,000  compound  S&T  dictionary  entries 
directly  absorbed  from  the  Mark  II  Russian  Master  Dictionary,  and 
(b)  an  additional  70,000  S&T  stem  entries;  (2)  output  translation 
improvements  based  upon  analysis  of  homographs,  adverbs,  adnominal 
genitives,  numerals,  proper  names,  sequences  of  tenses,  abbreviations 
and  article  insertion;  (3)  further  sentence-wide  improvements  on  the 
syntactic  level  (parsing)  and  semantic  level  (contextual  solutions); 
(4)  implementation  of  means  for  improving  efficiency  of  SYSTRAN 
processing  on  IBM  360/65  equipment. 

The  above  tasks  have  been  carried  out  concurrently  with  main¬ 
tenance  of  a  fully  operational  Russi an-Engl i sh  MT  capability 
throughout  the  reporting  period. 

Dealt  with  effectively  under  Task  (1)  is  a  critical  and  demand¬ 
ing  requirement  of  MT  --  compilation  of  a  large  MT  lexical  and 
grammatical  data  base  for  extensive  text  coverage.  The  following 
are  represented  in  SYSTRAN  dictionaries:  physics,  electronics, 
computer  hardware  and  data  processing,  aviation  and  space,  mechanical 
engineering,  biology  and  medicine,  metallurgy,  military  sciences, 
chemistry,  earth  sciences  and  mathematics.  The  total  data  base 
includes  approximately  144,000  stem  entries,  160,000  compound  entries 
and  3,300  idiomatic  and  phrasal  constructions.  Subject  report 
explicates  the  use  of  a  SYSTRAN  dictionary  update  subsystem,  but 
not  reflected  are  the  often  overlooked  consistent  efforts  by  those 
linguists  who  have  proofread  each  of  the  added  130,000  entries, 
providing  equivalents  and  syntactic  coding  as  required  for  MT 
operations.  Task  (2)  is  addressed  to  solutions  of  severe  target- 
language  problems  caused  by  the  above  listed  elements  of  the  source 
language.  Detailed  classifications,  especially  for  treatment  of 
homographs,  together  with  large  sample  lists  of  class  and  subclass 
members  (including  illustrative  computer  translation),  reflect 
essential  linguistic  components  for  an  operational  MT  system. 

Task  (3)  deals  with  automatic  sentence-structuring  of  larger  com¬ 
ponents,  as  clauses  and  phrases,  required  both  for  definition  of 
logical  relationships  and  word  order  rearrangement ;  a  Segment 
Analyzer  Program  has  been  implemented  for  these  purposes.  Contextual 
resolution  of  poly:>emanti c  words  has  proceeded  on  a  modest  scale  for 
priority  reasons.  Generally,  resolution  is  achieved  by  taking  the 
intersection  of  assigned  semantic  properties  and  syntactic  relation¬ 
ships  of  a  set  of  lexical  items  in  text,  where  at  least  one  item  is 
polysemantic  In  the  target  language  (see  p.  40-42).  A  modicum  of 
contextual  information  is  utilized  for  treatment  of  pronouns  during 


translation  (see  p.  118,  119).  For  Task  (4)  4 •  measures  to  improve^ 
SYSTRAN  processing  efficiency  have  been  implemented  in  tne  area  of 
automatic  dictionary  data  processing  (see  p.  92-94).  The  current 
SYSTRAN  System  output  rates  are  reported  in  the  range  of  250-300,000 
English  words  per  hour  of  elapsed  time. 

i 

The  System  operates  on  an  IBM  360/65  with  a  minimum  of  51 2 K 
bytes  of  main  storage.  Peripherals  are:  two  IBM  2314  direct  access 
facilities;  two  IBM  2401  tape  drives  (7-channel,  800  bp i  magnetic 
tape);  IBM  2540  card  reader  for  SYSIN;  IBM  1403  printer  for  SYS0UT: 
360  MVT  or  MFT  OS.  The  system  consists  of  27  operational  programs 
and  19  utilities  (total  of  51,373  instructions),  and  is  programmed 
in  360  Direct  Assembler  Language.

SECTION  I 
INTRODUCTION 

1.  GENERAL 

This  report  describes  an  optimization  phase  of  the  SYSTRAN 
(System  Translation)  machine  translation  technique.  During  this 
phase  some  important  milestones  were  reached  in  the  development 
of  an  operational  machine  translation  system,  which  may  have  an 
impa  c  on  current  linguistic  theories.  Included  is  a  description 
of  che  basic  tasks  performed  during  this  period.  In  addition  to 
its  translation  capability,  the  developed  system  is  also  capable 
of  gathering  data  for  its  own  further  improvement  and  of  testing 
grammars . 


This  report  takes  into  consideration  the  fact  that  the 


goals,  methods,  and  feasibility  of  machine  translation  have 


been  controversial  issues  during  the  past  ten  years.  SYSTRAN 


i  is  presented  as  a  typical  example  of  an  open-ended  system 

i' 

* 

'  which  develops  a  computer  intermediate  language  before  carry- 


1 


description  of  the  work  carried  out  under  the  contract.  Each 
contains  translated  samples  showing  how  the  tasks  envisaged 
within  the  work  statement  of  this  optimization  phase  have  been 
fulfilled. 

It  is  significant  that  this  refinement  effort  was  directed 
primarily  at  the  systematic  correction  of  errors.  These  errors 
had  been  made  mostly  at  the  level  of  human  dictionary  coding. 

They  have  been  detected  by  analyzing  large  amounts  of  computer 
output.  In  order  to  detect  and  rectify  these  errors,  it  was 
necessary  that  the  computer  utilize  its  existing  codes  in  trans¬ 
lating  texts.  Only  the  computer  itself  can  produce  all  the 
logical  consequences  of  any  particular  coding  schema.  No  human 
being,  no  matter  how  well  versed  in  Russian  grammar,  can  cor¬ 
rectly  assess  the  consequences  of  the  coding — or  lack  of 
coding — he  specifies.  It  is  possible,  however,  with  training, 
to  achieve  a  very  high  degree  of  error  recognition  in  trans¬ 
lated  output  and  to  deduce,  using  one's  own  knowledge  of  the 
parsing  rules,  what  sorts  of  codes,  by  their  absence  or  improper 
assignment,  resulted  in  the  translation  error. 

2 .  A  SCHEMATIC  INTRODUCTION  TO  SYSTRAN 

This  section  is  designed  to  give  a  basic  explanation  of 
how  the  SYSTRAN  translation  process  operates.  Three  different 
schemata  are  included,  giving  (1)  an  overview  of  the  entire 
process  from  input  of  the  original  Russian  text  to  final  machine- 
translated  output  as  it  is  received  by  the  post  editor,  (2)  a 
closer  look  at  the  actual  machine  translation  process  within  the 


2 


I 

IBM  360/65,  and  (3)  an  examination  of  the  special  dictionaries 

'  i  1 

formulated  and  used  by  SYSTRAN. 

a.  AN  OVERVIEW.  Any  text  Selected  for  translation  is 
typed  on  an  MT/ST  equipped  with  both  Cyrillic  and  Roman  charact¬ 
ers,  as  well  as  numerals.  (The  SYSTRAN  System  can  also  receive 
input  directly  from  punched  cards.  This  particular  input  pro- 

I  , 

cedure  is  not  illustrated  here.)  The  MT/ST  operator,  while 
familiar  with  the  Cyrillic  alphabet,  need  have  no  knowledge  of 

l 

the  Russian  language  per  se.  No  editing  whatsoever  is  required, 

so  the  operator  simply  types  whatever  appears  in  the  text  to  be 

\ 

translated,  indicating  at  appropriate  points  how  much  space 
should  be  left  for  the  later  inclusion  of  graphic  material 
(e.g.,  diagrams  and  charts)  which  cannot  be  typed. 1  This  material 

can  then  be  inserted  in  the  translated  output.  i 

1 

Each  MT/ST  cartridge  can  cbntain  up  to '24,000  letters,  or  1 

I 

approximately  3,000  Russian  words.  As  the  text  is  typed  on  the 
MT/ST  equipment,  an  MT/ST  cartridge  automatically  receives  a 

i 

particular  bit  configuation  for  each  letter  typed,  it  is  this 
information  that  is  converted  from  the  cartridges  to  360  tapes. 

The  conversion  consists  of  the  automatic  transformation  of  the 

! 

bit  configuation  on  the  cartridges  into  360  bit  configurations. 

A  360  tape  can  hold  the  contents  of  approximately  600  MT/ST 
cartridges,  but  any  number  of  cartridges  (or  even  half  of  a 
cartridge)  can  be  immediately  converted  and  transited. 

The  converted  360  tapes  serve  as  direct  input  to  tiu  trans¬ 
lation  system.  The  LOADTXT  program  reads  the  text  into  the 


3 


I  I 

1  i 

computer  while  the  360  processes  the  text,  the  main  frame  taking 
full  advantage  of  the  2314  disk  file  system  attached  to  it.  The 
disk  file  arrangement  is  specially  suited  to  the  translation 
process;  It  is  used  by  the  high  speed  core  primarily  for  dic¬ 
tionary  and  compound  expression  lookups.  The  information  con¬ 
tained  in  these1  dictionaries,  glossaries,  etc.,  is  constantly 
utilized  throughout  the  translation  process. 

The  disks  also  contain  the  entire  translation'  system  prior 
to  its  activation.  Each  section  (program,  routine,  etc.)  is 
called  by  the  control  program,  INITCALL,  and  loaded  into  the 
high  speed  core  as  'it  is  needed.  This  Whole  process  of 
sequential  control  is  performed  entirely  automatically  without 
human  interference.  In  other  words,  as  soon  as  the  text  is 

I 

loaded  in  and  INITCALL  is  activated,  SYSTRAN  carries  out  any  and 
all  tasks  necessary  for  dictionary  lookups,  structural  passes, 

i  ,  1 

etc.,  until  a , complete  syntactic  analysis  has  been  achieved  and 
the  total  input  has  been  translated. 

The  translated  product,  still1 on  360  tape,  is  then  written 
into  a  magnetic  tape  in  a  1401  compatible  format  and  subsequent¬ 
ly  printed  out  by  an  IBM  1403,  The  printed  output  contains 
upper  and  lower  case  letters  and  suitable  punctuation  and  spac- 

i  ' 

ing.  The  post  editor  therefore  receives  a  translation  on  which 
he  can  perform  tasks  similar  to  those  of  any  editor  working,  on 
the  products  of  a  human  translator.

b.  SYSTRAN  SUPPORTING  SYSTEMS.  The  most  important  part 
of  machine  translation,  in  that  it  is  the  most  basic  part,  is 
comprised  of  its  dictionaries.  SYSTRAN'S  are  stored  in  the 
2314  disk  file.  The  disk  dictionaries  necessary  to  SYSTRAN 
translation  processing  are  created  by  utilizing  a  series  of 
supporting  systems.  These  systems  can  be  described  as  follows: 

(1)  Stem  Dictionary  Update  system  maintains  the 
master  tape  of  stem  dictionary  entries. 

(2)  Idiom/Limited  Semantic  (L.  S.)  Dictionary  Update 
system  maintains  the  master  tape  of  Idiom  and 

L.  S.  dictionary  entries. 

(3)  Creation  of  L,  S.  Compound  Dictionary  system 
creates  the  L.  S.  compound  dictionary  on  disk 
and  updates  the  stem  master  dictionary  with 
this  information. 

The  operational  procedure  of  these  systems  is  schematized 
in  Chart  II,  parts  1  through  3,  and  is  explained  in  the  follow¬ 
ing  paragraphs. 

Stem  Dictionary  Update.  {See  Chart  II,  part  1.)  Updating 
transactions  for  the  dictionary  are  keypunched  and  read  first 
by  an  editing  program  (DEDIT) .  All  codes  entered  on  the  card 
are  edited  for  correctness  and  formated  for  computer  processing. 
The  edited  transactions  are  then  sorted  to  the  master  dictionary 
sequence  (stem  and  stem  number)  and  are  ready  to  update  the 
master  dictionary.  The  update  takes  place  in  two  operations. 

In  the  first  pass  of  the  master  tape,  all  stem  entries  except 


additional  forms  of  infinitive  verbs  are  updated  by  the  master 
update  program  (DUPDT) .  The  infinitive  verb  carries  a  table  of 
the  additional  forms,  and  when  the  infinitive  is  updated,  all 
dictionary  codes  for  the  infinitive  are  written  out  for  each 
additional  form.  These  records  are  then  sorted  in  master  dic¬ 
tionary  sequence  and  the  intermediate  master  dictionary  created 
by  DUPDT  is  updated  with  these  entries  by  the  additional  verb 
stem  update  program  (AVSPASS) .  A  listing  of  the  new  master  stem 
dictionary  is  prepared  by  a  dictionary  print  program  (DPRINT) . 

Idiom/L.  S.  Compound  Dictionary.  (See  Chart  II,  part  2.) 
The  initial  load  of  the  master  dictionaries  on  disk  do  not  con¬ 
tain  L.  S.  compound  information  but  are  used  in  creating  the 
compound  disk  dictionary.  The  first  two  programs  ( LOADTXT  and 
MDL)  of  the  SYSTRAN  translation  system  are  used  to  retrieve 
dictionary  information  from  the  disk  for  association  with  the 
individual  words  of  each  L.  S.  expression.  These  dictionary 
codes  are  analyzed  by  a  program  (CLS3)  to  create  an  individual 
A.  S.  compound  record.  (All  L,  S.  programs  are  identified 
by  the  letters  CLS  plus  a  number.)  The  principal  word  of  the 
expression  is  assigned  by  this  program  and  a  supplementary  word 
updating  record  is  written  to  a  separate  file.  The  individual 
compound  records  are  sorted  to  principal  word  sequence  and  read 
by  the  next  L.  S.  compound  creation  program  (CLS4) .  This  pro¬ 
gram  creates  a  master  compound  record  combining  all  L.  S.  com¬ 
pounds  which  have  the  same  principal  word  and  topical  glossary 
into  a  single  compound  record.  As  these  compound  records  are 


7 


written  on  disk,  their  address  is  included  in  an  index  record 
and  written  on  disk  for  each  principal  word  indicating  the 
location  of  the  compounds  for  the  different  topical  glossaries 
for  this  word.  An  updating  record  of  this  index  is  written  in  a 
separate  file.  The  supplementary  and  principal  word  index  up¬ 
dating  records  are  read  by  another  stem  dictionary  updating  pro¬ 
gram  ( DtJPDTLS)  and  the  address  of  the  index  record  and  principal 
and/or  supplemsntary  word  indicators  are  attached  to  the  stem 
dictionary  masv.er.  Again,  as  in  updating  the  stem  dictionary  by 
DUPDT ,  the  L.  S.  information  for  the  additional  forms  of  the 
verb  are  written  to  a  file  and  sorted  to  dictionary  sequence. 

The  sorted  records  are  read  and  the  final  new  master  stem  dic¬ 
tionary  is  created  by  the  AVSPASS  program.  A  repeat  of  the  Disk 
Dictionary  Load  system  is  performed  to  establish  the  translation 
disk  dictionaries  with  L.  S.  compound  information.  All  disk 
dictionaries  are  now  ready  for  SYSTRAN  translation  processing. 

c.  SYSTRAN  TRANSLATION  PROCESSING.  While  there  are  in¬ 
herent  difficulties  associated  with  substituting  a  computer  for 
a  human  translator,  primarily  due  to  the  computer's  inabil¬ 
ity  to  "understand,"  the  computer's  limitations  in  this  respect 
are  overcome  by  SYSTRAN  in  utilizing  the  machine's  great  speed, 
its  unlimited  capacity  for  storing  source  material,  and  its 
ability  to  perform  repetitous  and  tedious  tasks  without  error. 
The  logic  of  the  SYSTRAN  translation  process  can  be  divided  into 
three  primary  phases:  table  lookup,  syntactic  analysis  in  the 


8

V  ^^<^B57RrtTSOT' 


k  HWWVMWWN 


source  language  and  synthesis  into  the  target  language,  (See 
Chart  III.) 

The  tables  carry  information  necessary  for  the  accurate 
translation  of  any  source  text.  Many  of  them  are  accessed 
through  the  use  of  addresses  to  variable  lengths  areas  which 
carry  the  expanded  information  on  disks.  The  codes  and  address¬ 
es  are  affixed  to  the  source  text  and  carried  from  this  phase 
into  syntactic  analysis  and  synthesis. 

LOADTXT  executes  the  instructions  for  input  and  work 
during  this  phase.  As  each  word  enters  the  high  speed  core,  it 
is  matched  against  a  table  of  high  frequency  words  which  also 
contains  the  first  word  of  all  idioms.  (See  Chart  III,  High 
Frequency  and  Idiom  Lookup) .  Locating  these  words  and  separat¬ 
ing  from  low  frequency  words  saves  considerable  search  time, 
since  the  HF/Idiom  Table  is  kept  in  the  high  speed  core  and 
therefore  does  not  have  to  be  brought  in  from  auxiliary  disk 
storage.  Moreover,  the  meaning  and  grammar  codes  of  high 
frequency  words  are  stored  separately  in  a  table  accessed  by 
offset  or  address  linkage.  The  addresses  are  stored  with  each 
word  in  the  HF/Idiom  Table  and  are  attached  to  source  text  words 
when  matches  are  found.  These  text  words  are  then  stored  in  a 
high  frequency  file. 

Source  text  words  which  are  not  matched  in  the  above  pro¬ 
cess  are  sent  directly  to  a  low  frequency  file  for  the  main 
dictionary  lookup  (MDL)  program.  MDL  calls  in  the  words  from 
the  low  frequency  file  and  accumulates  them  on  disk.  The 


/ 


portions  of  text  words,  along  with  portions  of  stem  tables 
(which  are  also  on  disks)  are  read  into  memory.  (See  Chart  III, 
MDL.)  Stents  are  stored  on  three  different  disks,  according  to 
length  (1-3  characters,  4-7  characters,  8-24  characters).  Each 
entry,  a  source  language  stem  word,  has  attached  to  it  paradig¬ 
matic  set  codes  (PST)  indicating  the  endings  permitted  for  that 
stem.  There  is  also  an  address  at  each  stem  pointing  to  the 
disk  location  of  additional  grammar  and  meaning  information  and 
to  Limited  Semantic  (L.  S.)  information  if  the  entry  may  func¬ 
tion  in  an  L.  S.  expression. 

After  all  the  words  in  the  low  frequency  file  have  been 
processed  by  MDL  and  supplied  with  appropriate  grammar  and 
meaning  codes,  they  are  sorted  and  put  into  a  merged  file  with 
the  words  from  the  high  frequency  file.  At  this  point,  all  the 
words  with  their  codes  are  put  back  into  their  original  sequence 
in  the  sentence  and  the  sentence  is  ready  for  syntactic  analysis. 

The  programs  which  perform  the  syntactic  analysis  are  ini¬ 
tiated  and  sequentially  ordered  by  INITCALL.  INITCALL  first 
calls  GETSENTN  to  initiate  the  analysis  of  the  words  as  they 
function  in  the  particular  sentence  held  in  the  analysis  area. 
(See  Chart  III,  Sentence  Analysis  Area.)  The  sentences  are 
called  individually  from  the  merged  file  into  the  analysis  area 
in  memory.  The  first  88  bits  (11  bytes)  of  each  word's  160 
bytes  contain  constant  information  which  will  not  be  modified  by 
the  structure]  passes. 

Words  which  have  been  determined  by  LOADTXT  as  components 


10 


of  L.  S.  expressions  are  marked  as  having  been  translated.  The 
principal  word  of  the  expression  will  carry  the:  target  meaning 
of  the  entire  expression. 

The  structural  passes  (STRPASSO  -  STRPASS4)  indicate  the 
results  of  their  activity  in  the  1192  bits  remaining  for  each 
word  in  the  sentence  analysis  area.  The  information  placed  in 
these  bytes  is  not  static  and  may  be  re-evaluated  during  any 
succeeding  pass. 

i 

STRPASSO  detects  homographs'  and  resolves  their  part  of 
speech  ambiguities  by  using  special  subroutines  to  analyze  the 
relationships  of  homographs  to  other  parts  of  the  sentence.  For 

i 

example,  it  may  decide  that  a  noun/verb  homograph  functions  in 

I 

a  particular  sentence  as  an  infinitive  because  it, is  immediately 
preceded  by  a  word  which  has  an  infinitive  requirement. 

STRPASSO  also  marks  definite  objects  by  setting  appropriate  bits 
at  the  source  text  words.  ; 

As  STRPASS1  moves  from  right  to  left  (sentence-end  to 
sentence-beginning) ,  each  part  of  speech  (POS)  code  encountered 

j 

initiates  subroutines  to  set  switches  indicating  that  word's 
position  and  potential  function. 

I 

STRPASS2  determines  the  function  of  punctuation  marks. 
Commas,  semi-colons,  parentheses,  quotation  marks,  dashes,  etc., 
all  carry  POS  codes,  just  as  individual  words  do.  These  codes 
indicate  functions  of  punctuation  marks,  and  yield  additional 
information  contributing  to  marking  structures  not  revealed'  in 
STRPASS1 . 


11 


S*8^®8^S(?'RS*S5«<b»  ycjmvrmnm 


I 

STRPASS3  locates  subjects  and  predicates.  It  uses  two  pri¬ 
mary  tools:  PCS  codes  and  a  hierarchical  search  criteria  based 
on  the  probability  of  certain  parts  of  speech  becoming  subjects 
or  predicates  more  commonly  than  others.  The  predicate  is  de¬ 
termined  first;, then  the  subject  search  begins.  Subjects  and 
predicates  must  agree  in  number  arid  gender  (whenever  applicable). 

STRPASS3  also  analyzes  commas  with  indeterminate  function. 
S^nce  the  location  of  subject  and  predicate  often  aids  in  the 
discernment  of  embedded  clauses,  some  commas  may  now  be  recog¬ 
nized  as  subsehtence  unit  (SSU)  separators.  In  addition,  some 

i  i 

1  commas  are  clearly  seen  to  be  enumerative,  in  the  case  of  mul- 

‘  i  J 

tiple  subjects  and/or  predicates. 

i  ''.he.  subject-predicate  search  in  STRPASS3  may  also  occasion 
re-evaluation  of  a  nouh  marked  by  STRPASSl  as  an  object.  If  no 
other  subject  candidate  is  found,  that  object  will  be  re- 
evaluated  as  the  subject  if  a  finite  verb  has  been  found  during 
the  predicate  search.  1 

I 

STRPASS4  looks  at'  the; entire  sentence  for  words  which  have 
not  been  previously  recognized.  STRPASS4  continues  to  operate 
until  it  has  marked  all  words  as  having  governing  or  subordinate 
functions.  When  words  both  govern  and  are  governed  in  turn, 
that  situation  will  also  be  indicated. 

;  ,  f 

The  third  and  last  major  part  of  the  translation  process  is 
the  synthesis,  into  the  target  language.  This  is  accomplished, 
basically,  by  branching  on  each  part  of  speech.  For  example, 
the  routines  which  translate  verbs  into  English  use  tables  in 


12 


memory.  Selection  of  these  tables  depends  in  part  on  whether 
the  verb  is  active  or  reflexive  or  whether  or  not  the  auxiliary 
TO  BE  is  used  in  any  conjugation.  Each  table  looks  for  tense, 
aspect,  person,  number,  conditionality,  negation,  etc.,  to  de¬ 
termine  which  English  auxiliary  or  pronoun  should  be  used  with 
any  particular  verb. 

There  are  also  special  routines  for  inserting  English 
articles  (Russian  has  no  articles)  and  for  ensuring  die  proper 
translation  of  prepositions.  The  rearrangement  program  takes 
into  consideration  the  unique  word  order  requirements  of  the 
target  language.  It  contains  rules  governing  word  order  in 
English  which,  with  the  grammar  codes,  enable  the  program  to 
establish  correct  sequt  rtces  of  words  and  to  direct  that  this 
specified  word  order  be  printed  in  the  translated  output.

i.  INTRODUCTION 

i 

Optimization  of  SYSTRAN  dictionaries  during  this  phase  was 
primarily  directed  at  the  correction  of  errors  introduced  at  the 
human  level  during  coding.  The  key  a.spect  of  dictionary  opti¬ 
mization  has  been  SYSTRAN'S  ability  to  check  possible  errors  and 

1 

print  diagnostic  messages  regarding  the  types  of  errors  it  en- 

^  ,  1 

counters. 

Improvements  in  SYSTRAN'S  parsing  abilities  were  dependent 
to  a  large  extent  on  correction  of  dictionary  codes,  since  these 
codes  refer  not  only  t6  meaning  information,  but  also  to  impor- 

,  ,  I 

tant  grammatical  information,  such  as  parts  of  speech  and  govern¬ 
ment  requirements  of  entries.  In  addition,  the  SEGMENT  ANALYZER 
Program  was  instituted  to  analyze  clauses  and  phrases  by  syn¬ 
tactic  levels. 

The  Work  Statement  de-emphasized  semantics  in  favor  of  lexi- 

.  1  * 

cal  and  syntactic  improve...  ’nts .  Therefore,  the  work  effort  in 
this  area  was  directed  primarily  at  handling  polysemantic  lexical 
items.  Nonetheless,  it  is  felt  that  a  great  deal  of  furthei  in¬ 
vestigation  into  the  area  of  semantics  is  called  for  at  this 
time.i  SYSTRAN  is  now  ready  to  implement  more  sophisticated  se- 

i  i 

mantic  criteria  in  its  recognition  grammar.  A  survey  of  the 

types  of  improvements  envisaged  in  this  area  is  presented  in

section  eight  of  this  report  ("The  Future  of  Machine  Transla¬ 
tion")  .

2.  DICTIONARY  OPTIMIZATION 

SYSTRAN  dictionaries  have  been  considerably  improved. 
Grammar  codes  and  synthesis  codes  were  systematically  checked 
and  whenever  necessary  updated  or  corrected.  Meanings  for  about 
70,000  stem  entries  and  50,000  compound  entries  were  checked. 
During  the  systematic  checking  and  correction,  full  advantage 
was  taken  of  built-in  SYSTRAN  dictionary  update  features.  The 
SYSTRAN  dictionary  update  program,  which  accepts  corrections 
or  new  entries,  checks  on  possible  errors  on  two  levels  and 
prints  a  diagnostic  message  whenever  it  may  be  assumed  that  any 
coding  or  keypunch  error  has  occurred. 

The  first  level  of  checking  is  performed  directly  on  the 
keypunched  transactions  by  an  edit  program  (DEDIT  and  IEDIT) 
which  immediately  eliminates  from  the  update  process  those  re¬ 
cords  containing  detected  errors.  The  second  level  of  checking 
(DUPDT)  occurs  during  the  actual  update  of  the  dictionary  master 
tape  and  ensures  the  proper  modification  of  the  master  file. 
Prior  to  replacing  the  dictionaries  on  disk  that  are  used  during 
translation,  these  diagnostic  messages  are  analyzed,  corres¬ 
ponding  correction  transactions  are  prepared,  and  the  dictionary 
master  tape  is  again  updated.  This  update  subsystem  of  SYSTRAN 
is  a  powerful  feature  which  assures  that  the  working  diction¬ 
aries  of  this  operational  system  can  only  be  improved  at  each 
update,  without  running  the  risk  of  introducing  new  errors. 

In  the  following,  a  list  of  messages  will  be  given  which 
the  SYSTRAN  dictionary  updating  subsystem  may  use  any  time  an

report  to  elaborate  on  all  these  messages  and  their  significance 
as  far  as  update  is  concerned.  The  intent  here  is  to  give  a 
general  illustration  of  the  means  by  which  an  update  subsystem 
can  prevent  the  incorporation  of  inaccurate  data  in  the  SYSTRAN 
dictionaries.

In  addition  to  updating  the  dictionary,  a  good  deal  of 
correction  of  existing  entries  was  necessary  to  ensure  that  all 
entries  carried  all  the  proper  grammar  codes.  The  size  of  the 
dictionary  made  it  requisite  to  discover  automatic  means  to  pin¬ 
point  sections  of  the  dictionary  requiring  intensive  review,  to 
appropriately  code  deficient  entries,  and  then  to  update  the 
dictionary  with  the  corrected  codes.  For  this  purpose,  Special 
Dictionary  Print  Programs  were  designed  and  implemented  to  be 
used  when  certain  entries  were  discovered  which  lacked  neces¬ 
sary  codes,  when  new  codes  or  coding  methods  are  devised  to  be 
incorporated  in  certain  categories  of  entries,  or  when  consis¬ 
tent  erroneous  coding  has  been  discovered  and  can  be  isolated 
for  editing  by  a  few  preliminary  tests  (i.e.,  RMD  nouns  ending 
in  AM,  AMI,  AX) . 

The  following  special  dictionary  prints  were  programmed, 
run,  and  coded  in  these  categories:

3.!  PARSING  OPTIMIZATION 

By  utilizing;  160  bytes1  for  each  word  in  any  sentence  under 
analysis,  SYSTRAN  allows  access  to  all  grammatical  and  semantic 
information  pertinent  to  that  word  in  any  possible  context. 

The  information  contained  in  the  160  bytes  attached  to  each 
word  of  the  sentence  (as  briefly  discussed  later  in  this  chapter) 
expresses  the  syntactic  interconnections  of  the  sentence  in  a 
manner  understandable  to  the  computer.1  The  algorithms  of  the 
various  programs  which  supply  the  codes  held  in  these  bytes  are 

i  ■ 

guided  by  the  principles  of  the  SYSTRAN  grammar.  This  grammar 

i 

grew  out  of  the  necessity  of  applying  the  computer  to  natural 

i  !  I 

languages. 

As  Dykema  points  put,  grammar  began  as  a  philosophical 
inquiry  into  the  nature  of  language.1  The  most  methodological 
and  global  inquiry  into  any  system  can  be  carried  out  by  the 
computer  if'  a  suitable  software  system  exists,.  SYSTRAN  has  all 
the  prerequisites  of  such  a  system.  Its  system  is  modular,  has 
several'  subsystems  composed  of  major  programs  subdivided  by 
minor  programs,  and  further  subdivided  by  major  and  minor  rou¬ 
tines.  These  programs  and  routines  may,  whenever  necessary,  call 

i 

generalized  or  specialized  subroutines,  which  in  turn  use  nested 

I 

routines  for  special  inquiries  and  special  coding  tasks. 

The  SYSTRAN  grammar,  breaks  away  from  many  traditional  gram- 

t  1 

muH cal  concepts.  For  example,  the  parts  of  speech  are  devel¬ 
oped  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  system.  Hence  there

are  many  more  parts  of  speech  within  SYSTRAN  than  the  eight  or 
fifteen  of  human  grammars.  These  parts  of  speech  are  estab¬ 
lished  on  two  criteria:  the  primary  parts  of  speech  are  based 
on  congruence  of  primary  function?  the  secondary  parts  of 
speech,  on  differtiae  within  the  primary  groupings. 

a.  SEGMENT  ANALYZER  PROGRAM.  The  Segment  Analyzer  Pro¬ 
gram  was  defined  and  incorporated  in  SYSTRAN'S  parsing  apparatus 
to  improve  syntactic  analysis.  The  program  scans  the  sentence 
for  specified  subordinate  clause  initiators,  coded  as  such  in 
the  stem  or  idiom  dictionary.  All  words  within  a  clause  are 
marked  according  to  the  type  of  clause  initiator.  Parenthetic 
words  are  also  marked.  Any  words  in  the  sentence  which  are  not 
marked  in  this  way  as  belonging  either  to  subordinate  clauses 
or  to  parenthetic  expressions  or  within  parentheses  are  given 
main  clause  indications.  Phrases  (participial,  gerundial,  pre¬ 
positional)  are  marked  before  the  SEGMENT  ANALYZER  is  activated. 

They  are  regarded  as  parts  of  the  clauses  to  which  their  first 
word  is  attached. 

At  each  word  of  the  sentence,  two  bytes  are  used  by  the 
SEGMENT  ANALYZER.  One  contains  dictionary  information,  indi¬ 
cating,  for  example,  that  the  particular  word  may  initiate  a 
specific  type  of  subordinate  clause,  or  that  it  may  begin  a 
second  main  clause,  or  that  it  belongs  to  a  parenthetic  expres¬ 
sion  or  to  an  idiom.  The  other  byte  indicates  the  level  to 
which  the  word  belongs.  An  FI  in  this  byte  indicates  that  the 

word  is  part  of  the  first  main  clause;  an  F2,  that  it  is  part 
of  the  second  main  clause,  etc. 


27 


The  following  pages  contain  lists  of  (1)  subordinate 
clause  initiators,  (2)  parenthetic  words,  and  (3)  words  which 
almost  always  begin  new  (second  or  third)  main  clauses  (i.e., 
coordinate  clauses) . 

The  SEGMENT  ANALYZER  was  designed  and  implemented  to  es¬ 
tablish  a  "level"  mode  of  analyzing  subsentences,  so  that  lower 
level  (embedded)  clauses  might  be  more  accurately  recognized 
and  handled.  It  replaced  the  use  of  "sentence  cuts"  in  estab¬ 
lishing  subsentence  units.  Trained  linguists  checked  SYSTRAN'S 
level  output  and  concluded  that  level  codes  do  work  much  more 
efficiently  and  accurately  than  cuts;  subsequently,  further 
improvements  were  made  in  recognizing  levels:  rules  were  estab¬ 
lished  for  recognizing  colons  as  main  clause  initiators;  commas 
were  recognized  as  clause  initiators  as  they  simultaneously  in¬ 
dicated  phrase  ends.

b.  REARRANGEMENT.  During  this  optimization  phase,  several 

I 

rearrangement  procedures  were  tested,  especially  those  concerning 
complex  sentences.  It  was  found  that  rearrangement  of  the  sub¬ 
ject  and  predicate  in  both  the  main  clause  and  the  subordinate

clause  resulted  in  awkward  and  confusing  English  sentences,  since 

•  '  J  .  *  ' 

the  predicates  of  both  cl;,-  vses  were  juxtaposed  at  the  end  of 
the,  sentence.  It  was  also t discovered  that,  if  in  the  Russian 
sentence  the  predicate  precedes  the  subject,  then  rearrangement 
should  be  effected  only  if  in  the  translation  the  subject  and 
predicate  are  not  separated  by  twelve  or  more  words., 

1  1  i  i  1 

Special  subroutines  have  been  incorporated  into  the  main 
program  to  improve  SYSTRAN'S  rearrangement  technique!  These  sub- 

l 

routines  carry  out  range  searches  of  the  items  to  be  rearranged. 

I  {  ,  J 

The  predicate  range  search  encompasses  all  objects  (direct  and 

1  ‘  I 

indirect)  of  the  verb  and  all  of  its  adverbial  modifiers.  These 

i 

items  are  marked  so  thiat  they  may  be  moved  with  the  verb.  A 

I 

double  indexing  technique  makes  it  possible  to  rearrange  items 

1  ‘  f 

within  the  specified  range,  as  well  as  to  move  all  the  items 
specified  by  the  range  as  a  unit.  (Adverbs  which  should  not  be 

I  ! 

rearranged  cafry  codes  to  that  effect.)  , 

I  ;  ; 

Similarly,  the  noun  range  routine  checks  for  all  modifiers 
of|  the  subject(s).  .Further  routines  were  introduced  to  deter¬ 
mine  the  proper  governors  of  prepositional  phrases  occurring 

’  I 

between  constituents  marked  for  rearrangement.  Additional 
routines  were  required  for  names,  English  letters)  mathematical 
formulae,  etc.,  to  determine  their  proper  point  of  attachment 
before  rearrangement  was  effected. 

c.  A  COMPARISON  OF  HUMAN  AND  SYSTRAN  PARSING.  The  fol¬ 


lowing  sentence  has  been  chosen  to  illustrate  SYSTRAN'S  present 
parsing  capabilities  by  comparing  two  granynatical  analyses  of 


32 


it:  one  done  by  Soviet  linguists  in  Russia;  the  other,  by 
SYSTRAN . 

The  sentence,  from  Sevbo,  I.  P.,  "0  gromozdkosti  sintak- 
si£eskix  structur,"  Naucno-Texniceska~)a  Informacija:  Automati- 
zacija  perevoda  tekstov,  sar.  2,  No.  2,  Moscow  (1971),  p.  42, 
is  the  following: 

PO  3T0MU  POVODU  UMESTNO  VSP0MNIT6 ,  CTO  KOGDA  UDAETS4

OT  AKSIOMY  VYBORA. 

This  Russian  sentence  was  analyzed  by  SYSTRAN'S  parsing 
program  and  codes  were  attached  accordingly.  It  is  not  the 
aim  of  this  report  to  enumerate  and  elaborate  upon  all  the 
codes  developed  and  used  within  SYSTRAN.  Rather,  the  aim  is  to 
show  the  results  of  human  and  mechanical  parsings  of  the  same 
sentence.  Figure  1  shows  the  human  analysis;  Figure  2,  the 
SYSTRAN  analysis.  This  type  of  diagram  is  used  here  only  be¬ 
cause  it  is  the  type  used  in  the  Soviet  article.  Unfortunately, 
the  graph  does  not  allow  many  SYSTRAN  analysis  codes  to  be  shown. 
For  example,  while  SYSTRAN  points  from  a  governor  to  a  governed 
word,  and  back  to  the  governor  from  the  governed  word,  thai 
cannot  be  shown  here. 

The  numbers  and  letters  along  the  right-hand  side  of  Fig¬ 
ure  2  indicate  SYSTRAN  clause  levels:  FI  identifies  the  first 
main  clause  (F2  would  indicate  a  second  main  clause);  02  iden¬ 
tifies  a  CTO  clause;  50,  words  with  parenthesis;  Cl,  a

K0T0R01  clause;  etc.  (See  list  in  I. 2. a.) 

The  major  difference  in  the  illustrations  is  the  attachment 
of  the  first  CTO  to  the  rest  of  the  sentence.  The  human  analysis 
attaches  it  directly  to  GOVOR4T,  which  is  linked  to  TO  which, 
in  turn,  is  linked  to  KOGDA.  TO  is  attached  to  nothing  except 
KOGDA  and  GOVOR4T.  This  reflects  the  major  difference  between 
the  human  translator  and  the  computer:  the  human  can  intui¬ 
tively  infer  the  author's  intention,  while  the  computer  must 
rely  on  what  the  author  has  actually  written. 

In  this  particular  instance,  the  author,  ignoring  tradi¬ 
tional  rules  of  Russian  grammar,  has  omitted  the  comma  between 
CTO  and  KOGDA.  (Normally,  any  new  subordinate  clause  marker 
will  require  a  comma.)  The  human  analyst  "reads  in"  the  comma, 
thereby  creating  or  recognizing  that  the  KOGDA  clause  is  embed¬ 
ded  in  the  CTO  clause.  The  computer,  meeting  this  unusual  cir¬ 
cumstance  of  adjacent  subordinate  clause  initiators  which  are 
not  separated  by  a  comma,  has  no  indication  that  two  subordinate 
clauses  are  initiated  virtually  simultaneously.  Therefore  (Fig¬ 
ure  2) ,  it  assigns  a  CTO  clause  marking  to  CTO,  to  KOGDA  and  to 
the  entire  ensuing  clause. 

It  will  be  seen,  however,  in  the  following,  that  the  trans¬ 
lated  output,  i.e.,  the  actual  translation  done  by  SYSTRAN,  was 
not  affected  by  this  failure  to  identify  the  KOGDA  clause  sep¬ 
arately  from  the  CTO  clause: 

IN  REGARD  TO  THIS  IT  IS  APPROPRIATE  TO  RECALL  THAT  WHEN 
IT  IS  POSSIBLE  TO  EXCLUDE  FROM  THE  CONSTRUCTION  OF  ANY 
FRAGMENT  OF  A  THEORY,  FOR  EXAMPLE,  THE  AXIOM  OF  CHOICE 
(SEE  BELOW)  NOT  BY  A  MORE  EXPENSIVE  PRICE  THAN  THAT  BY 


36 


WHICH  WE  PAY  FOR  THE  NONACCEPTANCE  OF  A  CONTINUUM  HYPO¬ 
THESIS  IN  THE  MENTIONED  REGIONS  OF  MATHEMATICS,  THEN  IT 
IS  SAID  THAT  THIS  FRAGMENT  OF  A  THEORY,  IN  ESSENCE,  DOES 
NOT  DEPEND  UPON  THE  AXIOM  OF  CHOICE. 

In  order  to  further  demonstrate  SYSTRAN'S  parsing  abilities, 
another  sentence,  analyzed  by  L.  N.  Iordanskaja, 2  is  illustrated, 
along  with  SYSTRAN'S  analysis  of  the  same  sentence.  Again,  the 
codes  used  by  SYSTRAN  have  been  "translated"  into  a  format  com¬ 
patible  with  that  chosen  by  Iordanskaja.  In  her  diagram,  she 
used  arrows  to  point  from  governors  to  words  they  govern.  It 
should  be  kept  in  mind  that  SYSTRAN'S  hexadecimal  output  also 
shows  pointers  from  governed  words  back  to  their  governors. 

Figure  3  shows  Iordanskaja ' s  analysis;  Figure  4,  SYSTRAN'S 
analysis. 

In  this  particular  instance,.  SYSTRAN'S  analysis  was  more 
detailed  than  th<->  human  one,  in  that  it  shows  the  connections 
between,  as  well  as  within,  clauses.  Thus,  KOTOROE  points  back 
to  TREBOVANIE. 

Moreover,  the  human  analysis  leaves  the  conjunction  A  dang¬ 
ling.  It  is  not  shown  to  be  attached  to  any  other  word  in  the 
sentence.  SYSTRAN,  however,  recognizes  that  both  KLADOISKATELEM 
and  UCENYM  are  complements  of  BYT6,  It  recognizes  this  relation¬ 
ship  by  recognizing  a  relationship  between  NE  and  A:  if  a  comma 
and  A  (,A)  are  preceded  by  NE  and  a  noun  or  adjective,  and  if  no

of  this  grammatical  principle  also  allowed  SYSTRAN  to  differen¬

BUT  AN  AUTHENTIC  SCIENTIST. 

4.  SEMANTICS 

' 1  ^ i 

For  computer  systems  such  as  SYSTRAN,  it  is  best  to  regard 
the  Meaning  of  any  lexical  item  as  an  aspect  of  performance  and 
to  class  certain  lexical  forms  as  items  characterized  by  expo¬ 
nential  features  known'  in  the  outside  language  as  primary  dimen¬ 
sion.  That  is,  the  meaning  of  a  word  varies  within  certain 
definable  limits  according  to  associative  relations  built  within 
sets  of  circumscribed  syntagmatic  variables. 

|  The  task  from  which  improvements  related  to  semantics  are 
to  emanate  consists  primarily  of  selecting  polysemantic  words 
establishing  existing  syntagmatic  relations,  and  devising  a 
working  procedure  which  automatically  narrows  the  wide  diver¬ 
gence  of  relationships  regularly  occurring  in  Russian  techno¬ 
logical  texts, by  establishing  valid  generalized  rules.

The  available  evidence  shows,  for  instance,  that  the  word 
KOLICESTVO  furctions  with  several  meanings,  two  of  which  possess 
distinctive  denotations,  each  depending  on  the  semantic  category 
characterising  the  word  with  which  KOLICESTVO  is  grammatically 
and  syntagmatically  associated.  In  the  translation,  either  of 
two  different  meanings  is  assigned:  AMOUNT  or  NUMBER. 

AMOUNT  denotes  an  aggregate  on  the  sum  total  of  two  or 
more  quantities  and  KOLICESTVO  carries  this  meaning  when  it  forms 
a  grammatical  unit  with  words  that  belong  to  the  semantic  cate¬ 
gory  comprised  of  items  designated  as  collective  or  non-unit 
nouns.  These  are  30L6,  MASLO,  PAR,  VODA,  NEFT6 ,  TEMPERATURA, 
TEPLO,  BIOMASSA,  KISLOROD,  SAXARY,  PRIMES 6,  POROWOK,  TALL I 1 , 
ORTOFOSFAT ,  PLATINA,  KALI1 ,  GELI1,  MED6 ,  KREMNI1,  etc. 

NUMBER,  on  the  other  hand,  denotes  the  sum  total  of  a  col¬ 
lection  of  units  and  KOLICESTVO  carries  this  meaning  when  it 
forms  a  grammatical  unit  with  words  that  belong  to  the  semantic 
category  comprised  of  items  designated  as  countable  or  unit 
nouns.  These  are  IZMERENIE,  PLENA,  TOCKA,  ZERNO,  INGIBATOR, 
VARIANT,  0B7EKT ,  PREDSKAZANIE ,  MIKROOP.GANIZM,  BAKTERI4 ,  MOL- 
LEKULA,  FERMENT,  SPORA,  CLEN,  MIKROB,  MUTANT,  QIKL,  ZAMYKANIE, 
SLOl,  etc. 

Although  the  above-listed  nouns  may  share  several  semantic 
categories,  the  two  mentioned  he^e  suffice  in  order  to  write  a 
program  which  clearly  distinguishes  between  the  two  meanings  and 
selects  the  approp:. rate  one  during  the  structural  analysis  of 
KOLICESTVO,  provided  all  pertinent  codes  are  attached  to  both 


41 


KOLICESTVO  and  the  words  in  the  list. 

As  an  example,  two  sentences  are  given  here  to  illustrate 
SYSTRAN'S  capabilities  in  carrying  out  improvements  on  the  level 
of  semantics.

SECTION  III 


FURTHER  IMPROVEMENTS  EFFECTED  DURING  OPTIMIZATION 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

In  order  to  demonstrate  SYSTRAN  capabilities  in  translating 
Russian  sentences  into  English,  live  data  were  used  to  sub¬ 
stantiate  each  discussion  in  this  section  of  the  report.  Dur¬ 
ing  output  analyses,  sentences  were  selected  on  the  basis  of 
the  particular  areas  covered  by  the  Work  Statement  in  order  that 
they  could  be  used  as  practical  examples  illustrating  the 
appropriate  improvements.  Homograph  examples  are  shown  at  the 
end  of  this  section  in  reductions  of  actual  computer  print-outs. 

a.  IMPROVING  THE  TRANSLATION  OF  HOMOGRAPHS.  Russian  words 
identified  as  homographs  {lexical  or  morphological)  are  entered 
into  the  Stem  Master  Dictionary  as  full-form  ent’-’es,  each 
identical  form  carrying  its  appropriate  grammar  codes  (i.e., 
both  morphological  and  syntactic  information)  and  the  corres¬ 
ponding  meaning  with  its  synthesis  codes.  The  full- form  entries 
comprising  a  homograph  are  differentiated  in  the  dictionary  by 
a  sequential  number,  or,  a  Dictionary  Stem  Number  (DSN). 

DRUGOM ,  for  instance  is  entered  under  DSNOO  and  DSN01,  and  the 
codes  indicate  that  the  '00'  entry  is  a  noun,  masculine  singu¬ 
lar,  instrumental,  animate  with  the  meaning  FRIEND  while  '01*  is 
an  adjective  (actually,  a  noun-adjective  ambiguity),  masculine, 
neuter,  singular,  locative  meaning  OTHER.  The  numbers  *00,' 
'01,*  '02,'  are  assigned  to  the  different  entries  of  the 


43 


homograph  according  to  descending  order  of  predicted  use.  All 
entries  identified  as  homographs  carry  the  necessary  code  HM 
(homograph) . 

During  translation  processing  within  the  Main  Dictionary 
look-up  pass,  a  textword  that  is  in  the  dictionary  as  an  HM 
entry  is  matched  with  the  entry  having  DSNOO.  A  normal  output 
processing  record  is  built  containing  the  associated  grammar 
and  target  language  meaning.  At  this  time  multiple  output 
processing  records  are  prepared  for  each  of  the  additional 
homograph  entries  in  the  dictionary. 

Prior  to  parsing,  a  standard  analysis  area  is  built  for 
each  textword  in  the  sentence.  This  area  provides  for  a  maximum 
of  105  words  per  sentence.  Following  this  area  is  a  provision 
for  an  additional  30  analysis  word  areas  where  the  multiple 
homograph  word  entries  are  placed.  Each  word  entry  in  the 
standard  area  that  is  identified  as  a  homograph  entry  contains 
in  a  byte  the  relative  word  sequence  in  the  combined  analysis 
area  of  the  first  additional  homograph  entry  for  that  word. 

Then  each  additional  homograph  entry  contains  the  sequence  num¬ 
ber  of  the  next  until  the  last  which  has  a  zero  sequence  num¬ 
ber. 

In  Structural  Pass  Zero  (STRPASSO)  the  standard  analysis 
area  is  scanned  for  homograph  indications  and  routines  are 
activated  by  routine  numbers  carried  as  dictionary  codes  in  the 
stem.  Each  routine  examines  the  environment  of  the  word  in  the 
sentence  and  a  decision  is  made  as  to  the  desired  part  of  speech 


44 


for  the  function  of  the  homograph.  .Using  standard  processing 

MACROS ,  the  homograph  record  for  this  part  of  speech  is  located 

1  *  »  4 

and  this  analysis  word  entry  is  moved  to  the  location  in  the 
standard  area.  It  may  be  that  the  desired  entry  is  the  one 

i 

already  in  the  area,  in  which  case  nQ  movement  takes  place. 

Each  successive  word  is  scanned  for  a  homograph  indication 
until  the  end  of  the  sentence  is  reached.  The  standard  analysis 
area  contains;  at  this  point,  the  final  grammar  and  target 

language  translation  pointers  to  be  used  throughout  the  trans-

For  the  purpose  of  avoiding  discrepancies  that  might  result 
from  the  presence  of  homograph- type  words,  selected  groups  were 
established  on  the  basis  of  which  homographs  can  be  properly 
dealt  with  at  specific  points  during  the  translation  processes. 
These  groups  are  given  below,  containing  appropriate  examples 
and  a  brief  description  of  the  solution  6f  the  homograph  ambigu¬ 
ity.

DRUG  scans  four  words  to  the  left  of  the  current  word  in 
search  for  a  vehicle-word  requiring  the  locative  case.  If  this 
condition  is  satisfied,  the  adjective-HM  is  used.  If  not,  the 
noun-HM  is  selected. 

NACR 

Resolves  Noun/Verb  Ambiguity 

HM:  NACALO 
NACALA 

This  routine  selects  the  verb-HM  if  the  current  word  is 
followed  by  an  infinitive  or  if  there  is  neither  a  finite  verb 
nor  an  auxiliary,  nor  a  short  form  neuter  singular  in  the  sub¬ 
sentence.  It  also  selects  the  verb  when  a  neuter  finite  verb 
or  an  auxiliary  is  encountered  which  is  enumerated  with  the 
current  word. 

EST6R 

Resolves  EAT/Present  Tense  Auxiliary  Ambiguity 

HM:  EST6 

This  routine  searches  three  words  to  the  left  of  the 
current  word  for  a  word  with  an  infinitive  requirement.  If 
found,  the  infinitive-HM  EAT  is  used,  otherwise  the  finite  verb 
form,  present  tense,  singular  or  plural,  of  the  auxiliary  BE 
is  used.

word  is  an  adverb  or  ’NE';  if  so,  the  adverb  is  used.  If  the 
word  after  the  current  word  is  a  verb  or  short  form  adjective, 
the  adverb  is  used  again.  If  a  verb  follows  the  current  word 
and  requires  the  instrumental  case,  the  adverb  homograph  is 
used.  If  the  word  after  the  current  word  is  an  adjective, 
adjectival  noun,  pronoun  adjective,  or  a  participle  and  the 
word  before  the  current  word  is  in  the  instrumental  singular, 
the  noun  homograph  is  used.  If  there  is  an  instrumental  gover¬ 
nor  to  the  left,  the  noun  is  used.  If  the  following  word  is  a 
noun  (pure  noun,  proper  noun,  or  profession)  forming  an  adnomi- 
nal  genitive  construction,  the  noun  homograph  is  used.

This  routine  checks  the  word  before  the  current  word. 

If  a  finite  auxiliary,  the  short  form  participle  homograph 
is  used.  It  is  also  used  if  the  scan  to  the  left  locates 
ON  or  a  nominative  singular  case  noun.  The  verb  is  used  if 
MY  is  found  in  the  left  scan.  It  is  also  used  when  MY  is  to 
the  right,  provided  no  adjective  or  accusative  noun,  or  parti¬ 
ciple  is  to  the  left. 


NEUTFM 

Resolves  Neuter/Feminine  Ambiguity 


HM:  JELEZO 

JELEZA

NEUTFM  determines  if  the  current  word  is  preceded  by  an 
adjective,  then  it  is  the  adjective  which,  on  the  basis  of 
grammatical  agreement  determines  the  correct  choice.  For  the 
resolution  of  the  ambiguous  -A  ending,  the  neuter-HM  is  chosen 
when  a  noun  immediately  precedes  since  this  suggests  an  adnomi- 
nal  genitive  construction.  The  ambiguous  ~U,  -E  endings  present 
a  need  for  a  further  search  within  the  sentence  for  governors 
which  resolve  this  ambiguity. 

VESR 

Resolves  Verb/Noun  Ambiguity 

HM:  VESTI 

This  routine  selects  the  infinitive  if  the  word  pre¬ 
ceding  the  current  word  has  the  infinitive  requirement.  In  all 
other  cases,  the  noun  is  used. 

SUTR 

Resolves  Verb/Noun  Ambiguity 

HM:  SUT6 

This  routine  checks  simultaneously  to  the  left  and 
to  the  right  of  SUT6  for  a  nominative  plural  noun.  If  both 
are  found,  the  verb  homograph  is  used.  In  all  other  cases,  the 
noun  homograph  is  set  in  the  translation. 


50 


NPREPR 

Resolves  Noun/Preposition  Ambiguity 
HM:  POD 

This  routine  looks  to  the  right  of  the  current  word  for  a 
noun  phrase  [i.e.,  (adverb)  +  (adjective)  +  noun]  in  the  instru¬ 
mental  case.  If  such  a  noun  phrase  is  not  found,  the  noun  homo¬ 
graph  (meaning  and  codes)  replaces  the  more  common  prepositional 
entry. 


UJER 


Resolves  Comparative/Adverb  Ambiguity 


HM:  UJE 

This  routine  checks  on  the  word  following  the  current  word. 
If  it  is  a  common  noun,  proper  noun,  or  a  noun  denoting  a  pro¬ 
fession  and  it  is  in  the  genitive  case  and  if  the  word  preceding 
the  current  word  is  an  adjective,  adjectival  noun,  or  participle 
also  in  the  genitive  case,  the  adverb  is  chosen.  If  the  preced¬ 
ing  word  is  not  in  the  genitive  case,  the  comparative  is  chosen. 

CONJAR 

Resolves  Conjunction/Abbreviation  Ambiguity 

HM:  A 

This  routine  sets  the  current  word  to  the  abbreviation 
homograph  if  the  word  is  capitalized  and  does  not  begin  the 


51 


sentence.  The  abbreviation  HM  is  also  selected  if  a  comma 
follows,  which  is  in  turn  followed  by  the  letter  'B,'  a 
period,  or  closed  parenthesis,  if  a  comma  follows  the  current 
word  (and  there  is  no  'B'  after  it),  the  conjunction  is  chosen. 

FIMNAR 

Resolves  Feminine  Instrumental  Singular/Masculine 

Nominative- Accusative  Singular  Ambiguity 

HM:  PR0B01 

This  routine  checks  the  word  immediately  to  the  left  of  the 
current  word.  If  it  requires  the  instrumental  (i.e.  ,  if  it  is 
'S,'  'NAD,’  'POD,'  or  'PERED’)/  the  feminine  noun  is  chosen.  If 
an  adjective  or  participle  is  found  immediately  preceding  the 
current  word,  it  is  checked  for  case.  If  nominative,  the  mascu¬ 
line  noun  is  used,  and  if  instrumental,  the  feminine  noun  is 
used. 

NCOMPR 

Resolves  Noun  Feminine  Dative- Locative/Comparative 

Ambiguity 

HM:  GU5E 

This  routine  scans  to  the  right  for  the  word  'CEM'  and,  if 
it  is  found,  the  comparative  homograph  is  chosen.  If  an  adjec¬ 
tive  or  participle  is  found  immediately  to  the  left  or  in  a  scan 
to  the  left,  and  if  it  is  locative  or  dative  and  feminine 

52 


I 


/ 


singular,  then  the  feminine  noun  homograph  is  chosen.  If  the 
last  two  conditions  are  not  met,  the  comparative  is  selected. 


VSEMR 

Resolves  Locative-Dative/lnstrumental  Ambiguity 


HM:  VS EM 

This  routine  checks  the  word  in  front  of  the  current  word. 

i 

If  it  is  one  of  the  prepositions  'V,'  'NA,'  '0/0B,'  or  ' PRI,' 
the  locative/dative  form  of  * VSEM1  is  chosen.  All  other  cases 

i 

point  to  the  instrumental  form  of  the  word. 


ABVBR 

“  l 

Resolves  Imperative/Abbreviation  Ambiguity 


HM:  SM. 

This  routine  checks  if  the  current  word  is  the  sentence 
beginning.  If  it  is,  the  imperative  homograph  is  selected.  If 
a  numeral  directly  precedes  the  current  word,  the  abbreviation 

i 

is  chosen.  In  all  other  cases,  the  imperative,  form  is  used. 


KOMR 


Resolves  Noun/Pronoun  Ambiguity 


HM:  KOMU 
KOM 

If  the  word  encountered  is  KOMU,  and  there  is  an  accusative, 
adjective  or  participle  immediately  to  the  left,  the  noun 


53 


I 


homograph  is  used.  If  the  adjective  or  participle  is  in  any 
other  case, ; the  pronoun  is  selected.  If  no  adjective  or  parti¬ 
ciple  is  encountered,  there  is  a  scan  to  the  right  and  the  left, 
for  a  word  requiring  the  dative  or  a  word  requiring  the  accusa¬ 
tive.  If  the  dative  requirement  is  found,  the  pronoun  is  used, 

i  j 

while  the  noun  homograph  is  chosen  if  an  accusative  requirement 
is  found.  1  1 

1  If  KOM  is  the  current  word,  and  the  word  immediately  to 

I 

its  left  requires  the  locative  case,  the  pronoun  is  used.  If 

i 

none  exists ^  the  noun  homograph  is  chosen. 

SPOR  1 ‘ 

Resolves  Masculine/Feminine  Ambiguity

HM:  SPOR/A 

i 

This  routinh  scans  to  the  right  of  the  current  word  to  the 
end  of  sub-sentence  unit  for  0  or  OB.  If  found,  the  masculine 
'SPOR'  homograph  is  selected.  If  a  genitive  plural  follows  the 
current  word,  it  is  made  the  feminine  'SPORA.'  If  the  word 
before  the  current  word  (an  adjective)  ends  in  -1  and  the  cur¬ 
rent  word  has  a  null  ending,  the  masculine  homograph  is  chosen. 

If  the  adjective  ends  in  -YM,  again  the  masculine  is  chosen.  If 
the  current  word  ends  in  -0M,  the  same  choice  is  made.  If  the 
current  word  ends  in  -01,  the  feminine  homograph  is  used.  More 
endings  are  checked,  and  the  appropriate  homograph  is  assigned.

i 

tion  of  adverbs,  work  was  carried  out  using  live  data  from 
which  sentences  containing  adverbs  were  extracted  and  sorted 

according  to  the  nature  ‘of  needed  improvements.  Certain  ad-  1

verbs  were  selected  and,  on -the  basis  of  existing  SYSTRAN 

»  I 

rules,  methods  were  sought  by  which  additional , or  new  rules 
could  be  devised  and,  upon  being  tested  during  fresh  computer 
runs,  incorporated  into  the  System.  'A  special  subroutine  de¬ 
signed  to  deal  with  those  single-word  Russian  adverbs  which  are 
best  rendered  into  English  as  adverbial  phrases,  comprised  of  1 

'  I 

prepositions  and  nouns  is  described  below.  The  prepositions 
function  normally  (as  synsemantic  ,words) ,  while  the  nouns  are 

l 

the  carriers  of  the  meaning. 

A  representative  example  of  an  adverb  of  this  sort  is  the  ' 
word  VNACALE  which  has  the  meaning  IN  THE  BEGINNING  when  most 
appropriately  translated  into  English.  When,  this  adverb  is  con- 
corded  with  a  word  functioning  as  predicate  (or,  which  itself 

) 

is  concorded  to  the  left  with  an t auxiliary) ,  and  the  natural 
word  order  is  maintained,  the  translation  is  stylistically 

i  '  t  > 

awkward : 

I 

.  .  .  VNACALE  NE  VOZNIKAET  ... 

.  .  .  DOES  NOT  IN  THE  BEGINNING  ARISE  ... 

i 

This  substantiates  the  new  ESYN  modifications.  .The  "adverb" 

I 

or  "POS  30"  routine  checks  the  English  area  of  the  Dictionary 
Meaning  and  checks  for  the  words  AT,  BY,  FOR,  FROM,  IN,  and  TO 


I 


! 


followed  by  a  space  and  another  word.  If  these  conditions  are 
met,  the  adverb  is  rearranged  behind  the  predicate  and  the  con¬ 
cord  betweeh  that  adverb  and  verb  is  broken.  Other  adverbs, 
should  they  precede  the  verb,  remain  intact  for  the  new:  ESYN 
inserts.  ,  Thus  the  translation  becomes  as  follows: 

.  .  I 

i 

'  .  .  .  VNACALE  NE  VOZNIKAET  ... 

.  ;  .  DOES  NOT  ARiSE.IN  THE  BEGINNING  .■  .  ■. 

i 

Should  the  sentence  be  modified  by  insertion  of  additional 
adverbs  located  before  the  finite  verb,  the  translation  would 

I 

be  similar  to  the  following  example: 

t 

...  VNACALE  NE  0CEN6  CASTO  VOZNIKAET  ...  1  i 

.  i 

.  .  .  DOES  NOT  VERY  OFTEN  ARISE  IN  THE  BEGINNING  .  .  .

Other  one- word  Russian  adverbs  actually  used  in  scientific 
texts  have  been  encountered  and  are  now  treated  according  to  the 
rules  of  this  POS  30  Rou*-’ne«

FOR  A  LONG  TIME 


Additional  adverbs  falling  into  this  group  can  be  compiled 
as  they  are  found  in  the  texts  in  order  that  they  also  may  be 
subjected  to  the  rules  of  this  routine/  and  contribute  to  the 
amelioration  of  the  translation  procedure. 

Further  modification  to  the  ESYN  programs  affecting  POS  04 
(finite  verbs)  and  POS  44/48  (infinitives)  has  been  accomplished. 
The  new  rule  splits  the  inserted  auxiliary  material  before  the 
first  adverb  concorded  with  the  verb.  The  formula  is  as  follows: 

Aux  +  Adv  +  Verb  (finite  or  infinitive) 

In  case  of  an  infinitive,  the  TO,  having  been  suppressed  at 
the  verb,  is  inserted  before  the  adverb.  The  formula  is: 

TO  +  Adv  +  Verb  (infinitive) . 

In  case  of  finite  verbs,  only  the  main  verb  form  and,  for 
reflexive  verbs,  the  reflexive  pronoun  are  inserted  at  the  verb 
while  the  auxiliaries,  pronouns,  and  negations  are  inserted  be¬ 
fore  the  adverb.  The  formula  is 

Aux/Pron/Neg  +  Adv  +  Verb  (finite) 

The  procedure  described  in  this  rule  will  ensure  that  the  collo¬ 
cated  expression  ODNOVREMENNO  VY4VL4ETS4  is  translated  IS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY  EXPOSED. 

Special  "adverb"  routines  based  on  an  adverb  as  the  current 
words  are  being  developed  for  the  purpose  of  improving  the  trans¬ 
lation  procedures.  Two  such  lexical  routines  whose  current 


1 


57 


words  are  XOROWO  and  SOVSEM  are  given  here. 

The  XOROWR  is  initiated  by  «:.he  text  word  XOROWO  which 
carries  the  dictionary  meaning  WELL.  This  translation  is  modi¬ 
fied  to  GOOD  when  the  word  functions  as  a  predicate  or  when  it 
is  not  concorded  to  right  or  left. 

Example:  XOROWO,  CTO  V  OCERKAX,  POSV45ENNYX  0TDEL6NYM 

INFEKQIAM  .  .  . 

IT  IS  GOOD  THAT  IN  DESCRIPTIONS,  DEVOTED  TO 
SEPARATE  INFECTIONS  .  .  . 

When  XOROWO  is  concorded  to  the  right  or  left,  it  is  translated 
WELL. 

Example:  3TI  REZUL6TATY  XOROWO  SOGLASUHTS4  S  DANNYMI 

DRUGIX  ISSLEDOVATELill. 

THESE  RESULTS  WELL  AGREE  WITH  THE  DATA  OF 
OTHER  INVESTIGATORS. 

or:  INFEKQII  OPISANY  XOROWO. 

THE  INFECTIONS  ARE  DESCRIBED  WELL. 

The  SOVSEM  Lexical  Routine  is  initiated  by  the  text  word 
SOVSEM  which  carries  the  dictionary  meaning  ENTIRELY.  This 
translation  is  modified  by  preceding  and  following  verbal  ele¬ 
ments  . 

If  SOVSEM  is  preceded  by  a  negated  finite  verb,  negated 
auxiliary,  or  negated  infinitive,  the  translation  is  made  AT 
ALL. 


58 


/ 


Example:  ONI  NE  AGGLHTI NI ROVALI S 6  SOVSEM  V  BOLEE  POZDNIE 
SROKI. 

THEY  WERE  NOT  AGGLUTINIZED  AT  ALL  IN  LATER 
PERIODS . 

SOVSEM  preceded  by  a  non-negated  verbal  is  rendered  ENTIRELY 
from  the  SYSTRAN  Dictionary. 

Example:  ONI  AGGLHTINIROVALIS6  SOVSEM. 

THEY  AGGLUTINATED  ENTIRELY. 

If  SOVSEM  is  followed  by  the  negating  particle  NE  and  a 
correctly  negated  word,  this  negation  is  dropped  and  the  trans¬ 
lation  is  modified  in  one  of  two  ways,  depending  on  whether  or 
not  MALO  I LI  are  in  the  same  clause.  If  SOVSEM  is  preceded  by 
MALO  ILI ,  the  meaning  IF  is  assigned  to  ILI  and  the  meaning  AT 
ALL  to  SOVSEM. 

Example;  MI K ROBY  MALO  ILI  SOVSEM  NE  VIRULENTNY. 

THE  MICROBES  ARE  LITTLE  IF  AT  ALL  VIRULENT. 

If  neither  MALO  nor  ILI  are  there,  the  meaning  IN  NO  WAY  is 
assigned  to  SOVSEM. 

Example:  3TOT  METOD  4VL4ETS4  METODOM,  KOTORY1  PRIMEN4ETS4 

ILI  SOVSEM  NE  PRIMEN4ETS4. 

THIS  METHOD  IS  THE  METHOD  WHICH  IS  APPLIED  OR  IS 
IN  NO  WAY  APPLIED. 

Additional  adverbs  were  selected  and  special  "adverb" 
routines  were  developed  for  them.  Three  such  lexical  routines 


59 


whose  current  words  are  DAVNO,  OBRATNO,  and  VESSMA  are  also 
given  here. 

DVNOR 

This  routine  is  initiated  by  the  text  word  DAVNO  which  has 
the  dictionary  meaning  LONG.  The  routine  functions  only  if 
DAVNO  is  concorded  with  a  word  functioning  as  predicate.  In 
this  case,  DAVNO  has  its  meaning  modified,  and  the  predicate 
is  made  perfective. 

Before  any  other  operations ,  the  word  order  of  the  sentence 
is  modified  in  those  cases  where  DAVNO  is  concorded  with  a  pred¬ 
icate  to  its  left.  If  the  predicate  is  a  short  form  adjective 
or  participle,  the  dictionary  meaning  LONG  is  retained  and  the 
predj  cate  is  made  perfective  by  inserting  HAVE/HAS  (depending 
upon  number)  before  and  BEEN  afcer  DAVNO.  The  fourth  verbal 
form  (past  participle)  is  used. 

Example:  DAVNO  IZVESTNO,  CTO  VYDELENIE  CISTYX  KUL6TUR 

SV4ZANO  S  B0L6WIMI  TRUDN0ST4MI . 

IT  HAS  LONG  BEEN  KNOWN  THAT  THE  ISOLATION  OF 
PURE  CULTURES  IS  CONNECTED  WITH  LARGE  DIFFICUL¬ 
TIES. 

If  the  predicace  is  verbal,  it  is  always  made  perfective  as 
described  above.  (If  the  verb  is  past  tense,  HAD  is  used  instead 
of  HAVE/HAS) .  The  translation  of  DAVNO  is  rendered  A  COMPARA¬ 
TIVELY  LONG  TIME  if  it  is  preceded  by  SRAVNITEL6N0  (which  is 
eliminated  from  translation) .

Example:  3TA  PROBLEMA  IZUCAETS4  SRAVNITEL6N0  DAVNO. 

THIS  PROBLEM  HAS  FOR  A  COMPARATIVELY  LONG  TIME 
BEEN  STUDIED. 

If  the  predicate  is  a  past  tense  reflexive  verb,  DAVNO  is 
rendered  LONG  AGO. 


Example:  3TO  DAVNO  4VL4LOS6  USTANOVLENNYM  FAKTOM. 

THIS  WAS  LONG  AGO  AN  ESTABLISHED  FACT. 


This  routine  is  initiated  by  the  text  word  OBRATNO,  which 
carries  the  dictionary  meaning  BACK  (TGI  =  INVERSELY) .  The 
meaning  INVERSELY  is  used  if  OBRATNO  is  directly  followed  by  a 
form  of  the  adjective  PROPORQIONAL6NY1. 


Example:  POSLEDN44  MEN4ETS4  OBRATNO  PROPOROIONAL6NO 

CETVERTOl  STEPENI  DIAMETRA. 

THE  LATTER  VARIES  INVERSELY  FROM  THE  MACHINE. 


The  meaning  BACK  is  used  if  (1)  OBRATNO  is  directly 
followed  by  either  of  the  prepositions  V  or  NA  governing  the 
accusative,  or  if  (2)  OBRATNO  is  preceded  by  the  conjunction 
I  which  is  preceded  by  the  accusative  object  of  either  of  the 
prepositions  V  or  NA,  or  if  (3)  OBRATNO  is  directly  followed 
by  the  preposition  OT  and  within  five  words  to  the  right  there 
follows  the  preposition  K,  or  if  (4)  within  the  sub-sentence 
unit  to  the  left  of  OBRATNO  a  word  is  encountered  beginning 
with  the  clusters  UXOD.  PERE,  or  STEKA.

I  STEKALA  OBRATNO  V  BAK. 

ON  THE  CEILING  CONDENSED  THE  EVAPORATED  LIQUID 
AND  FLOWED  BACK  INTO  THE  TANK. 

The  meaning  VICE-VERSA  is  used  if  OBRATNO  is  immediately 

preceded  by  the  conjunction  I  but  it  is  not  preceded  by  the 

accusative  object  of  V  or  NA. 


Example:  3TO  PEREME5ENIE  FRONTA  PRIVODIT  K  IZMENENIH 

XARAKTERA  OTVETOV  NE1RONOV  S  TONICESKOGO  NA 
FAZICESKIl  I  OBRATNO. 

THIS  SHIFT  IN  THE  FRONT  LEADS  TO  CHANGE  IN  THE 
CHARACTER  OF  THE  ANSWERS  OF  THE  NEURONS  FROM 
"TONIC"  TO  "PHASAL"  AND  VICE-VERSA. 


VES6MAR 

This  routine  is  initiated  by  the  text  words  VES6MA  (diction¬ 
ary  meaning  AGAIN) .  When  VES6MA  is  followed  by  a  verbal,  its 
meaning  is  given  as  COMPLETELY. 


62 


Example:  3T0  VES6MA  0SL0JN4ET  PRAKTIKI  IMMUNIZAQII . 

THIS  COMPLETELY  COMPLICATES  THE  PRACTICE  OF 
IMMUNIZATION.  1 

When  VES6MA  is  followed  by  a  long  form  adjective  or 
participle,  its  meaning  is  VERY. 

I 

Example:  3T0  MOJET  BYT6  VES6MA  OGRANICENNYM. 

THIS  CAN  BE  VERY  LIMITED. 

When  VNOV6  is  followed  by  a  verbal,  its  meaning  is  made 
AGAIN. 

Example:  POSLE  CEGO  VNOV6  PEREVIVALI  NA  VYWE UP 0M4 NUT YE 

SREDY. 

AFTER  WHICH  THEY  AGAIN  REWOVE  ON  THE  AFORE¬ 
MENTIONED  MEDIUM.  i 

When  VNOV6  is  followed  by  a  long  form  adjective  and 

i 

participle,  its  meaning  is  NEWLY. 

Example:  VNOV6  OTKRYVAEMYE  ANTIBIOTIKI  OKAZYVAHTS4  UJE 
OPISANY. 

NEWLY  DISCOVERED  ANTIBIOTICS  ARE  ALREADY 
DESCRIBED. 

c.  PROPER  NAMES.  An  important  development  effected  during 
this  optimization  phase  has  been  the  recognition  and  automatic 
translation  of  proper  names  and  initials.  This  is  accomplished 
by  two  routines:  NAMER  in  Structural  Pass  0  and  NAMCHR  in 
Structural  Pass  4, 


63 


] 

lengths  in  non-homogenous  material.  The  initiating  characteris- 

!  I  . 

tic  in  the  input  material  is  initial  capitalization.  The  envir¬ 
onment  is  then  checked  for  possible  ihitials p given  names  and/or 
i  patronymics  in  the  standard  dictionary  and/or  titles  of  pro¬ 
fessions.  This  material  can  occur  either  in  a  normal  [title  + 

given  name(s)  +  last  name']  sequence  or  in  the  reverse  biblio- 

1  1  ' 

graphic  order:  [last  name  +  given  name (s) ] .  The  difficulty  is 

i 

compounded  by  the  variability  in  material,  by  the  fact  that  last 

1  ' 

name  and  initials  may  either  be  not-found  words  or  words  with 

*  ‘  I 

other  parts  pf  speech  assigned  in  MDL  (Main  Dictionary  Look-up) , 
and  by  the  fact  that  the  sentence  often  contains  only  one 
capitalized  last  name  without  any  initia-s  or  titles  to  confirm 
its  function. 

Many  names  are  encountered  for  the  first  time  in  each  new 
text  and  so  must  be  processed  automatically  without  inclusion 
in  the  standard  dictionary.  The  "name  units"  must  be  identified 
and  structurally  linked  for  correct  synthesis  of  the  English 
text.  This  includes  the  correct  placement  of  prepositions  and 
articles  (though  these  are  seldom  used).  In  addition,  in  order 
to  assign  the  proper  case,  gender,  and  number  to  the  "name 
units,"  the  endings  and  environments  of  the  names  must  be 
examined. 

thus,  all  the  ambiguities  created  by  dictionary  status 
are  overcome  before  structural  analysis  of  such  critical  areas 
as  noun  government  and  subject-predicate  relationships  occurs. 


64 


1 


NAMECHR  further  refines  the  treatment  of  those  names  which 
were  not  taken  from  the  standard  dictionary  (the  not-found 
words).  In  order  to  use  the  nominative-singular  Russian  as  the 
normative  English  name,  the  bit  structure  after  structural 
analysis  is  checked  and  the  endings  accordingly  altered.  Fol¬ 
lowing  this,  transliteration  of  the  name  is  carried  out  on  the 
new  stem  to  ensure  correct  assimilation  of  the  name  into  English. 


d.  NUMERALS.  Provisions  for  the  structural  analysis  of 
literal  and  written  cardinal  and  ordinal  numerals  are  made  in 
all  five  structural  passes.  The  position  of  each  routine  is 
determined  by  the  need  in  succeeding  passes  for  the  codes  and 
relationships  it  establishes. 

The  two  routines  in  Structural  Pass  0,  SPOR5  and  SPOR6 , 
set  the  preliminary  codes  necessary  for  the  proper  recognition 
of  basic  grammatical  relationships  in  Structural  Pass  1.  The 
first  routine,  SPOR5,  deals  with  the  irregular  government  of 
the  written  cardinal  numerals  DVA,  DVE,  TRI,  CETYRE,  OBA,  and 
OBE  and  of  all  literal  cardinal  numerals  ending  in  2,  3,  or  4. 
It  sets  up  the  appropriate  case,  gender,  and  number  codes  for 
recognition  in  later  passes  of  the  concord  of  these  numerals 
with  following  nouns.  It  also  provides  for  the  plural  trans¬ 
lation  of  the  noun  to  be  modified. 

The  second  routine,  SP0R6,  performs  an  even  more  basic 
function:  it  examines  not-found  words  in  order  to  isolate 
those  which  are  literal  ordinal  numerals  (3-GO,  15-E,  etc.). 


65 


The  isolated  numerals  are  then  assigned  the  case,  gender,  and 
number  codes  appropriate  for  their  endings  and  for  the  noun 
which  follows  them.  Further  provisions  are  made  to  translate 
the  ordinal  numerals  with  the  appropriate  English  equivalent 
(3RD,  15TH,  etc.). 

In  Structural  Pass  1  the  underlying  structural  relation¬ 
ships  are  established.  The  NUMBER10  routine  has  separate 
branches  for  literal  cardinal  numerals  ending  in  % ,  for  literal 
cardinal  numerals  ending  in  1  (except  11) ,  and  for  all  other 
cardinal  numerals.  Ordinal  numerals  are  treated  as  adjectives 
for  the  analysis  of  potential  concord.  Literal  cardinal  numer¬ 
als  ending  in  %  are  placed  in  an  adnominal  genitive  relation¬ 
ship  if  the  noun  following  is  in  the  genitive.  Otherwise 
they  proceed  through  the  routine  for  all  other  cardinal  numer¬ 
als  . 

The  OBAR  in  Structural  Pass  2  completes  the  handling  of 
the  irregular  government  of  OBA,  OBE,  DVA,  DVE,  TRI,  and 
CETYRE  which  was  begun  in  Structural  Pass  0,  SP0R5.  The  cross 
reference  codes  for  this  relationship  are  inserted  in  this 
routine. 

In  Structural  Pass  3,  cardinal  numerals  are  included  in 
the  list  of  subject  scans.  A  literal  cardinal  numeral  is 
accepted  as  a  subject  if  it  is  neither  governed  nor  an  apposi- 
tive  and  if  the  predicate  is  not  a  short  form  neuter  singular 
adjective.  A  written  cardinal  numeral  must  be  in  the  nomina¬ 
tive  case  or  govern  or  modify  a  noun  or  govern  the  preposition 


66 


IZ  to  be  accepted  as  a  subject.  Special  provisions  are  made  to 
ensure  that  the  numeral  subject  agrees  in  number  with  the 
English  predicate. 

ORDNUM  in  Structural  Pass  4  was  written  to  correct  the 
possible  concord  of  a  cardinal  numeral  with  a  noun  phrase  modi¬ 
fied  by  an  ordinal  numeral  and  to  provide  for  the  insertion  of 
the  particle  "OF"  before  an  ordinal  numeral  which  does  not 
modify  a  noun. 

The  execution  of  these  structural  routines,  linking  each 
cardinal  or  ordinal  numeral,  whether  written  or  literal,  with 
a  noun  or  verb  with  which  it  is  syntactically  related,  often 
determines  the  corresponding  English  translation. 

e.  ADNOMINAL  GENITIVES.  During  the  systematic  analysis 
of  SYSTRAN  output,  the  shift  towards  sophisticated  problems 
became  apparent.  Disregarding  dictionary  problems,  which  are 
simultaneously  corrected  during  the  output  analysis  procedure, 
the  factors  which  influence  translation  are  those  complex 
situations  which  come  to  the  surface  only  when  a  system  reaches 
a  high  level  of  automatic  parsing  capability. 

The  following  example  is  an  illustration  of  the  higher 
level  problems.  (Due  to  the  length  f  the  sentence,  only 
the  section  relevant  to  the  problem  will  be  given.) 

Example:  .  .  .  NA  VOZNIKOVENIE  P0ST04NN01  SOSTAVL4H5E1 

SKOROSTI  VETRA  V  NIJNIX  SL04X  .  .  . 


67 


The  SYSTRAN  translation  is: 

...  ON  THE  EMERGENCE  DIRECT  COMPONENT  WIND  VELOCITY  IN 

THE  LOWER  IONOSPHERE  LAYERS  .  .  . 

It  is  obvious  from  reading  this  translation  that  the 
adnominal  genitive  relationship  between  30STAVL4H5E1  and 
SKOROSTI  was  not  at  first  recognized.  Upon  analyzing  the 
printout  of  the  sentence  analysis  area  in  the  computer  high 
speed  core  memory,  at  the  time  when  the  translation  took  place, 
it  became  clear  that  both  P0ST04NN01  and  SOSTAVL4H5E1  were 
recognized  as  modifiers-  of  SKOROSTI,  due  to  the  fact  that  they 
have  common  cases  and  genders.  Their  part  of  speech  reflects 
that  they  are  noun- adjective  ambiguities.  If  such  noun- adjec¬ 
tive  words  can  modify  a  noun,  according  to  the  present  rules 
such  syntactic  connections  should  have  preference. 

On  the  basis  of  the  above  example,  the  following  additional 
rule  was  added:  If  a  noun-adjective  is  preceded  by  a  modifier 
and  followed  by  a  noun,  an  adnominal  genitive  relationship 
should  be  preferred  (if  codes  allow  it)  rather  than  a  modifier 
relationship.  After  the  incorporation  of  this  rule,  the  above 
sentence  portion  was  translated  as  follows: 

...  ON  THE  EMERGENCE  OF  THE  DIRECT  COMPONENT  OF  WIND 

VELOCITY  IN  THE  LOWER  IONOSPHERE  LAYERS  .  .  . 

Many  similar  higher  level  problems  have  been  encountered. 

In  all  cases  the  modularity  of  SYSTRAN  made  the  easy  inclusion 
of  the  improvement  possible. 


68 


f.  VERBS  +  OBJECTS.  Instances  have  been  encountered 

I 

demonstrating  that  some  Russian  verbs  'may  function  transitively 
and  that  they  may  also,  without  any  change  in  ’their  lexical  ’ 
meanings,  require  a  specific  preposition  which  expresses  the 

I 

verb-object  relationship  by  assuming  the  role  of  the  governor. 

As  an  example,  the  verb'  SUDIT6  is  considered  here  and  two 

\  '  > 

sentences  are  given  to  illustrate  the  two  grammatical  phe¬ 
nomena. 

First,  SUDIT6  is  used  as  a  transitive  verb  requiring  its 

i 

object  in  the  accusative  case.  i 

ONA  STAVIT  SEBE  QEL6H  IZL0JIT6  VPECATLENI 4  OCEVIDQA, 
SKRYVAVWEGO  SVOE  IM4  POD  NAZVANNYM  PSEVDONIMOM  OT  RABOTY 
TOGO  "BAKTERIOLOGICESKOGO ' OTR4DA  C$KVANTUNSK01  ARMII", 
DE4TELE1  KOTOROGO  SUDILI  NA  XABAROVSKQM  PROQESSE.. 

Second,  SUDIT6  is  used  with  the  preposition  OB  which 
governs  the  object  in  the  locative  case. 

T0L6K0  TAKOE  SRAVNITEL6N0E  ISSLEDOVANIE  POZVOLIT  SUDIT6 
OB  ISTINNOM  ZNACENII  TOGO  ILI  INOGO  KOMPONENTA  KLETKI  V 
VIRULENTNOSTI  KUL6TURY . 

I 

While  in  the  first  example  the  direct-object  requirement 
is  treated  in  the  normal  manner  during  the  structural  analysis, 
in  the  second  example  this  requirement  must  be  suppressed.  An 
instruction  must  be  implemented  which'  shuts  off  the  accusative 
requirement  once  the  preposition  0  or  OB  is  encountered,  there¬ 
by  inhibiting  the  recognition  of  ISSLEDOVANIE  as  the  direct 
object  of  the  verb.  The  subsequent  subject  routine  can  then 


69 


J 


correctly  recognize  it  as  the  subjebt  of  the  sentence. 

'  .  I  >  ‘ 

This  example  leads  to  the  hypothesis  that  this  function 

of  the  prepositional  phrase  initiated  by  0,  OB  may  be  related 
1  *  ' 
to  the  fact  that  a  proper  English  translation  of  the  preposition 

is  simply  the  omission  of  its  meaning  (SYSTRAN'S  preposition- 

■  i 

translation  code  9.9) .  When  the  meaning  of  a  preposition  is 
omitted,  the  English  usage  corresponds  to  an  English  direct 

l  :■ 

object,  the  equivalent  of  a  Russian  accusative.  Thus  in  each 
case  when  a  verb  governs  a  preposition  arid  indicates  an  omitted 
translation  for  that  word,  the  accusative  requirement  should 

i  1  ' 

be  suppressed. 

1  .  I 

g.  SEQUENCE  OF  TENSES.  During  the  output  analysis  it 
was  ievealed  that  sentences  containing  certain  adverbial 
expressions  require  special  considerations  with  respect  to 

I 

the  translation  of  tense  of  the  finite  verb  used  in  the  parti¬ 
cular  sentence..  Two  such  expressions  were  noted  and  classified 
as  a  type  of  indicator  signalling  that  the  present  tense  in  the 
Russian  narrative  might  be  rendered  by  the  past  tense  into 
English.  The  words  were  POSLE  and,  ZATEM,  translated  AFTER  and 
THEN,  respectively.  ' 

The  English  AFTER  may  be  followed  by  the  present  tense 
under  limited  conditions  only.  It  has  been  observed  that 
in  Russian  narrative  in  which  the  author  deals  with  the  descrip¬ 
tion  of  an  experiment  or  a  scientific  event  which  took  place 
in  the  past,  the  finite  verb  frequently  occurs  in  the,  present 


7.0 


tense  after  prepositional  phrases  initiated  by  POSLE  and  ZATEM. 
In  English,  however,  in  order  to  prevent  any  interruption 
in  the  continuity  of  action  with  respect  to  time,  these  present- 
tense  finite  verbs  have  been  regularly  rendered  in  the  simple 
past  tense.  The  tense-conversion  step  can  be  accomplished 
before  the  English  Synthesis  program  is  executed.  Examples 
follow: 

CEREZ  NEKOTOROE  VREM4  POSLE  0TDELENI4  AVT0MATICESK01 
STANQII  OT  RAZGONNOGO  RAKETNOGO  BLOKA  VKLHCAETS4  SISTEMA 
ORIENTAQII . 


AT  A  CERTAIN  TIME  AFTER  THE  SEPARATION  OF  THE  AUTOMATIC 
STATION  FROM  THE  ACCELERATING  ROCKET  BLOCK  THE  ORIENTA¬ 
TION  SYSTEM  WAS  SWITCHED  ON. 


POSLE  POLUCENI4  SVETLOGO  RASSYPCATOGO  WLAKA  WOD4T 
ALHMINI1  I LI  FERROALHMINI 1 . 


AFTER  OBTAINING  A  WHITE  FALLING  SLAG,  ALUMINUM  OR  FERRO- 
ALUMINUM  WAS  ADDED. 


The  adverb  ZATEM  appears  to  create  a  similar  situation, 
especially  when  the  present-tense  finite  verb  is  in  the  third 
person  plural. 


ZATEM  VYCISL4HT  SODERJANr 1  KOBAL6TA  I  JELEZA  V 
METALLICESKOM  NIKELE. 


THEN  THE  CONTENTS  OF  COBALT  AND  IRON  WERE  CALCULATED.

ZATEM  PRIBAVL4HT  =N  ML  VODY,  =N  G  MOCEVINY  I  NAGREVAHT  =N  MIN. 

THEN  IT  WAS  TREATED  WITH  =N  ML  OF  WATER  AND  =N  G  OF  UREA,  AND 
HEATED  FOR  =N  MIN. 

In  addition,  other  words  which  seem  to  influence  the 
choice  of  tense  have  been  considered.  The  expression  SLEDUET/IT 
FOLLOWS  indicates  that  the  future  tense  in  the  Russian  sentence 
should  be  translated  by  the  present  in  English. 

IZ  /=N/ ,  KAK  I  IZ  /=N/,  SLEDUET,  CTO  3TO  USLOVIE  BUDET

FROM  =N  AS  FROM  =N,  IT  FOLLOWS  THAT  THIS  CONDITION  IS 

FULFILLED  FOR  A  BODY  OF  SUFFICIENT  SIZE. 

Also,  the  connector  ESLI  when  followed  in  Russian  by  the 
future-tense  verb  form  (imperfective  or  perfective  aspect) 
should  be  added  to  the  list  of  words  to  be  considered  for  ren¬ 
dering  the  present-tense  verb  in  English.

h.  ABBREVIATIONS.  In  order  to  attain  high  efficiency  in 
translating  abbreviations  by  automated  means,  a  more  detailed 
processing  was  devised  and  made  effective.  Prior  to  these  mea¬ 
sures  each  abbreviation  wao  assigned  a  code  by  which  it  was 
identified  by  POS  and  BFQ  in  the  dictionary  and  processed  dur¬ 
ing  structural  analysis  as  a  common  noun.  No  provisions, 


12 


B 


however,  were  made  for  further  considerations  on  the  syntactic 
level.  This  approach  was  too  generalized  and,  in  terms  of  the 
more  sophisticated  development  of  the  System  in  other  areas 
of  the  linguistic  aspects  of  the  Russian  language,  no  longer 
adequate.  Improvements  were  therefore  instituted. 

The  main  effort  was  to  review  the  existing  file  of  abbre¬ 
viations  and  to  recode  each  entry  along  carefully  designed 
lines  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  develop  a  methodology  that 
could  be  expanded  and  utilized  either  for  coding  the  not-found 
abbreviations  revealed  during  each  translation  run  or  for  sys¬ 
tematically  coding  a  dictionary  of  abbreviations.  (The  latter 
would  require  the  expansion  of  input  conventions  to  allow  for 
better  differentiation  of  entries  through  the  identification 
of  italics,  variable  capitalization,  etc.) 

As  a  result  of  a  thorough  review  of  the  existing  file, 
it  was  found  that  the  standard  POS/BPQ  of  1C/13  should  be 


1  /vrS 


IW& 

si 


retained  only  for  those  abbreviations  which  perform  a  noun 
function  in  the  sentence.  In  this  way,  structural  modifications 
can  be  made  to  accommodate  this  large  group  more  specifically. 
What  did  emerge  from  the  investigation  was  that  in  addition  to 
the  noun  function,  abbreviations,  depending  on  interrelations 
of  words  in  a  sentence,  also  function  as  adjectives,  adjectival 
nouns,  pronoun-adjectives,  proper  nouns,  titles  of  professions, 
superlative  adjectives,  adverbs,  prepositions,  participles, 
numerals,  and  verbals.  Steps  were  taken  to  recede  the  file 
according  to  these  diverse  functions. 


, 


During  the  analysis  it  also  became  clear  that  certain 
abbreviations  needed  to  be  considered  as  homographs  and  should 
therefore  bear  codes  indicating  their  candidacy  for  homograph 
analysis.  It  is  anticipated  that  this  approach  will  prove  it¬ 
self  rewarding  and  will  increase  in  significance  in  the  future 
as  more  abbreviations  are  encountered.  To  illustrate  the 
importance  of  correctly  coding  items  which,  due  to  their 
versatility  of  function,  may  have  an  impact  on  their  environment 
as  far  as  the  grammatical  structure  is  concerned,  the  Russian 
SM  is  here  considered.  It  has  been  encountered  with  two  of 
the  following  meanings:  (1)  CENTIMETER  or  CM.,  and  (2)  the 
imperative  form  of  "see,"  i.e.,  SEE,  q.v. ,  vide,  or  c£.  When 
used  as  a  unit  of  measure,  this  abbreviation  is  preceded  by  a 
numeral  to  which  it  is  syntactically  tied.  When  it  functions 
as  a  verbal,  however,  it  is  desirable  that  the  System  recognize 
it  as  such,  since  the  structural  analysis  should  reveal  that 
SM,.  is  a  predicate,  or  governs  a  direct  object,  or  requires 
certain  prepositions.  The  sentence  structural  analysis  will 
be  greatly  improved  as  a  result  of  this,  yielding  a  better 
translation, 

A  list  is  given  below  presenting  the  various  noun  functions 
of  abbreviations  as  they  were  encountered  during  machine  trans¬ 
lation  output  analysis.  The  POS  and  BPQ  codes  assigned  to 
these  entries  in  SYSTRAN  dictionaries  are  at  the  head  of  each 
group  of  Russian  abbreviations  and  their  English  equivalents.

i.  ARTICLES.  The  article  routine  has  been  improved,  when¬ 
ever  logically  feasible,  to  consider  the  following  possibilities 
in  translating  from  the  Russian  language  to  English: 

1.  No  article  should  be  inserted  in  the  translation. 

2.  The  definite  article  should  be  inserted. 

3.  The  indefinite  article  should  be  inserted. 

Several  considerations  must  be  utilized  in  the  process  of 
developing  a  workable  tool  which  most  dependably  inserts  the 
English  article  correctly.  In  scientific  literature,  the 
definite  article  THE  is  used  more  often  than  the  indefinite 
article  A  or  AN.  With  nouns  standing  alone,  THE  is  used  as 
much  as  95  percent  of  the  time  while  with  others,  use  of  THE 
may  reach  a  full  100  percent:  in  one  instance,  ABSORPTION 
received  THE  225  times,  but  AN  only  12  times;  ABSENCE  x-eceived 
THE  135  times  and  AN  not  at  all.  Obviously,  THE  became  the 
primary  target  of  investigation. 

Nouns  standing  alone  may.  if  they  belong  to  particular 
conceptual  categories,  require  the  determination  normally  ex¬ 
pressed  in  English  by  THE.  This  article,  although  hardly  sub¬ 
ject  to  any  collocational  restrictions  (articles  are  found  in 
almost  any  lexical  environment  in  the  language  that  the  grammar 
permits),  can  be  shown  as  functioning  "structurally" — outside 
any  grammatical  reference — in  English.  This  is  substantiated 
by  observing  article  occurrence  in  a  large  corpus  of  running 


80 


text.  This  fact  alone,  provided  the  field  is  investigated  ex' 
haustively,  or  nearly  so,  eliminates  the  normally  expected 

i 

search  for  some  manifest  relationship  to  the  referential  and 
situational  meaning  of  the  words  concerned.  The  range  is 

!  i 

therefore  narrowed  to  the  ultimate  or,  at  the  most,  immediate 
constituent.  This  is  primarily  possible  because  the  literary 
style  of  technical  and  scientific  publications  tends  to  make 
use  of  sequence-type  sentences  rather  than  of  situation-type 
ones . 

The  information  below  is  the  result  of  a  preliminary  1 
analysis  of  nouns  and  their  determiners.  The  example  shows 
nouns  that  prefer,  to  a  certain  extent,  the  definite  article.

Another  way  of  considering  the  determiner  is  to  look  for 
the  presence  of  a  formula  or  a  number  which,  together  with  the 
noun  that  follows  it,  forms  an  identifiable  unit.  The  definite 
article  is  placed  before  such  a  unit  as  the  following  examples

Work  on  the  definite  article  in  English  also  consisted  of 
examining  a  large  body  of  texts  for  the  occurrence  of  THE  before 
words  placed  in  complete  sentences  as  modifiers  of  nouns.  The 
aim  was  to  establish  groups  of  words  grammatically  used  as 
adjectives  which  by  themselves  could  adequately  define  the  noun, 
necessitating  the  insertion  of  the  definite  article  before  it. 

To  avoid  an  approach  considered  nugatory  in  any  manner,  the 
procedure  was  based  on  live  and  valid  data  which  provided  for

a  circumspect  observation  of  the  "ambivalence"  generally 
attributed  to  the  English  articles.  The  outcome  yielded 
empirically  valuable  figures  which  were  systematically  com¬ 
piled  for  the  improvement  of  the  article  insertion  program. 

The  search  for  modifiers  influencing  the  choice  of  the 
definite  article  went,  due  to  the  availability  of  factual 
sentences  taken  from  texts  of  various  scientific  disciplines, 
beyond  the  conventional  selection  of  adjectives  (NEXT,  SAME, 
VERY,  ONLY,  PAST,  ORIGINAL,  etc.)  by  carefully  looking  at 
modifiers  which  were  consistently  preceded  by  the  definite 
article  and  at  modifiers  which  consistently  prohibit  the 
presence  of  the  article  (EACH,  EVERY,  ALL,  etc.)  The  table

When  certain  nouns  are  used  in  collocation-type  construc¬ 
tions  with  adjectives,  it  is  possible  to  group  them  according 
to  conceptual  categories  to  which  they  belong  and  to  determine 
whether  or  not  certain  adjectives  warrant  use  of  the  definite 
article.  One  such  category  is  "parts  of  a  living  body"  as  shown 
by  the  examples  below: 


THE  CONTRALATERAL  LEG 
THE  CONTRALATERAL  BICEPS 
THE  CONTRALATERAL  LIMB 
THE  CONTRALATERAL  SIDE 


Since  the  adjective  also  qualifies  to  be  categorized 
conceptually,  groups  can  be  developed  permitting  the  applica¬ 
tion  of  rules  for  the  insertion  of  the  definite  article.  One 
such  category  is  "proper  name"  as  in  THE  CASPIAN  GROUND-WATER 
FLOW  which  is  directly  related  to  the  name  THE  CASPIAN  SEA. 

When  the  construction  PROPER  NOUN  +  NCJN  is  preceded  by  a  modi¬ 
fier  the  whole  phrase  is  considered  as  one  unit  and  is 


87 


determined  by  THE,  as  in  THE  CRITICAL  JOSEPIISON  CURRENT. 
Additional  examples  are  offered  below:

MATRICES 
SUBMARINES 

THE  BROWNIAN  MOTION 

PARTICLES 

THE  DEBYE  FORMULA

RADIUS 

SPHERE 

THr!  DEBYE-HUCKLE  THEORY 

In  cases  where  neither  the  individual  noun  nor  the  adjec¬ 
tive  can  decisively  resolve  the  dichotomy,  the  search  for  the 
signal  is  directed  to  both  members  of  the  collocation  to  see 
which  of  the  particular  phrases  should  be  considered.  Pre¬ 
liminary  checks  have  revealed  that  METHOD  and  PHASE,  whenever 
modified  by  ACOUSTIC  and  ASCENDING,  respectively,  received  the 
indefinite  article  but,  whenever  modified  by  DESCRIBED  and 
CARBIDE,  received  the  definite  article.  Similarly,  the  phrase 
MACHINE  TRANSLATION  almost  never  takes  any  article,  but 
TRANSLATION  alone  may  take  either  THE  or  A. 

It  was  noted  that  certain  expressions  were  brought  for¬ 
ward  as  evidence  or  support  of  the  subject  matter  discussed 
by  the  author.  These  words,  for  the  most  part  modifiers, 
were  enclosed  within  quotation  marks  and  the  quotation  mark

The  given  list  establishes  the  fact  that  quotation  marks 
are  used  abundantly  in  scientific  texts.  The  palpability  of 
the  information  warrants  a  special  classification  of  the 
quoted  expressions  for  the  purpose  of  establishing  the  pre¬ 
dictability  of  the  occurrence  of  the  definite  article. 

Codes  have  been  established  on  the  basis  of  the  results 
of  these  investigations  and  incorporated  into  the  System.  It 
has  also  been  possible  to  code  verbs  which,  when  functioning 
predicatively,  define  nouns  in  such  a  way  that  definite  articles 
can  be  predicted  for  these  nouns.  Moreover,  certain  preposi¬ 
tions  (e.g.,  DL4  and  V)  have  been  coded  as  indicators  of 
definite  articles  for  their  objects.

SECTION  IV 

PROGRAMMING  SPECIFICS  IN  IMPROVING  THE  EFFICIENCY 
OF  SYSTRAN  PROCESSING 

i.  SELECTION  OF  L.  S.  COMPOUNDS  WITHIN  TOPICAL  GLOSSARIES 

Original  implementation  of  the  Limited  Semantics  Compound 
Dictionary  did  not  allow  for  special  selection  of  compounds  by 
topical  glossary.  As  the  number  of  L.  S.  expressions  added  to 
the  SYSTRAN  master  dictionary  grew,  a  provision  was  made  to 
carry  topical  glossary  indications;  however,  when  the  compound 
dictionary  was  created  for  use  during  translation  processing, 
all  expressions  were  considered  as  belonging  to  the  general 
meaning  category. 

By  including  all  expressions  in  the  dictionary,  regardless 
of  topical  glossary  for  a  common  principal  word,  the  generated 
compound  record  became  extremely  large.  Consequently,  MDL 
(Main  Dictionary  Lookup  program)  was  not  able  to  attach  the  long 
compound  information  within  the  limits  selected  for  efficient 
processing  through  the  sort  following  MDL  and  prior  to  the  final 
translation  phase.  The  long  compound  information  had  to  be 
retrieved  by  the  LSLOOKUP  program  in  the  final  translation 
phase.  Additionally,  selection  of  matching  compounds  with  the 
text  is  more  accurate  in  that  the  compounds  are  searched  for  a 
match  in  the  priority  order  specified  for  the  text  being  pro¬ 
cessed. 

To  create  the  L.  S.  Compound  disk  dictionary  by  topical 


92 


glossary,  the  CLS4  program  was  modified.  This  modification 
included  the  creation  of  an  index  file  to  the  main  dictionary 
file.  An  index  record  *s  created  for  each  principal  word  and 
contained  the  topical  glossary  indicator,  disk  address  of  the 
corresponding  compound  record,  and  the  length  of  the  compound 
record.  The  disk  address  of  this  index  record  rather  than  the 
disk  address  of  the  compound  record  is  passed  to  DUPDTLS  (L.  S. 
address  updating  program)  for  including  the  address  in  the 
master  stem  dictionary  file.  MDL  was  then  modified  to  access 
this  index  record.  The  index  record  is  scanned  for  requested 
topical  glossary  information,  and,  using  the  length  specifica¬ 
tion  in  the  index,  the  compound  record  is  either  attached  to 
the  text  word  or  the  disk  address  for  later  retrieval  by  LSLOOK- 
UP. 

The  LSLOOKUP  program  was  modified  to  analyze  the  compound 
records  for  a  match  with  the  text  in  requested  topical  glossary 
sequence.  Three  disk  track  areas  are  provided  for  retention  of 
compound  information,  and,  prior  to  accessing  the  disk  file  for 
compound  information,  these  areas  are  examined  for  the  presence 
of  the  desired  compound  already  residing  in  memory,  thus  elimin¬ 
ating  disk  retrieval  time. 

Parallel  to  making  the  before  mentioned  program  changes, 
the  L.  S.  compound  creation  programs  CLS1  and  CLS2  were  elimin¬ 
ated  and  their  functions  included  in  the  translation  processing 
programs  LOADTXT  and  MDL  since  their  contents  were  almost  ident¬ 
ical.  By  combining  the  instructions  in  common  programs,  any 


93 


change  to  the  basic  mechanics  of  processing  can  be  made  to  just 
one  program,  eliminating  updating  and  assembling  of  two  separate 
programs.  Additionally,  this  method  assures  accuracy  in  per¬ 
forming  identical  dictionary  lookup  of  text  wc  s  being  trans¬ 
lated  and  of  L.  S.  Expression  words  for  the  creation  of  the 
compound  dictionary. 

2.  LEXICAL  ROUTINES:  IMPROVED  HANDLING  OF  MULTIPLE-MEANING 

WORDS 

In  that  the  selection  of  lexical  routines  to  be  activated 
for  text  words  being  translated  is  partly  based  on  the  beginning 
word  characters  of  the  text  word,  a  standard  binary  search  rou¬ 
tine  could  not  have  been  used.  The  lexical  control  program  was 
therefore  initially  designed  with  a  sequential  table  lookup  for 
the  routine  desired.  The  number  of  lexical  routines  written  at 
that  time  were  few  so  this  method  was  about  as  efficient  as  the 
binary  search  type. 

As  the  number  of  lexical  routines  increased  to  several 
hundred,  the  sequential  search  bec.-^.ie  time  consuming.  Therefore, 
a  special  binary  search  routine  was  a deed  to  the  lexical  control 
program  to  determine  whether  or  not  the  text:  word  has  already 
been  translated  by  prior  translation  programs,  in  which  case 
execution  of  a  lexical  routine  for  this  text  word  can  be  elimin¬ 
ated.

SECTION  V 

SYSTRAN  AND  THE  CONTROVERSY  ABOUT  THE  FEASIBILITY.  OF 

MACHINE  TRANSLATION 

1  ' 

SYSTRAN  is  being  developed  at  a  time  of  considerable  con- 

I 

froversy  about  machine  translation,  or,  more  specifically,  about 

I 

the  expected  quality  of  machine  translation,  in  the  United 

States  as  well  as  abroad.  In  the  United  States  a  series  of  con- 

1 

ferences  were  held  at  the  U.  of  Texas,  devoted  to  the  study  of 


-  high  quality  translation.  In  the  Soviet  Union,  the  journal

translation. 

The  Texas  conference  investigated  the  problem  from  both

philosophical  and  technical  points  of  view;  we  concern  ourselves

with  the  latter  in  this  technical  report.  There  seemed  to  be 
general  agreement  that  subject  matter  (knowledge)  can  be  trans-

ferred  with  fidelity  by  automatic  means.  It  was  also  agreed 
that  translators  cannot  keep  up  with  irapid  technological  advances

tion  Of  technical  terms  and  concepts k 

SYSTRAN  uses  topical  glossaries  to  insure  proper  transla¬ 
tion  of  technical  terms  which  vary  in  meaning  from  one  subject 

area  to  another.  Not  even  one  third  of  SYSTRAN'S  topical  gloss- 

!  ' 

arization  capability  is  used  at  /this  time.  At  present,  meanings 

are  attached  to  SYSTRAN  dictionaries  in  only  1,0  Subject  fields, 

'  !  ! 
j although  the  present  System  could  handle  36  subject  field  areas 

i 

on  individual  lexical  entries  as  well  as  on  compound  levels. 

,  i 

This  means  that  SYSTRAN  is  presently  equipped  to  translate  texts 
irt  ten  different  Specialized  subject  areas,  and  is  potentially 

I  : 

ready  to  .translate  in  thirty-six  areas. 

.  :  1 

The  Texas  report  states  that  "programming1 of  many  linguis- 
tic  algorithms  remains  a'  slow  and  difficult  task.  It  should 

I 

be  noted  in  this  respect  that  this  statement  can  be  maintained 
only  if  a  suitable  language  to  communicate  with  the  computer 

i 

does  not  exist.  The  SYSTRAN  MACRO  language  developed  by  LATSEC, 

I 

INC.  overcomes  this  hurdle  and  makes  the  programming  of  linguis- 

i  ' 

,  tic  algorithms  a1  quick  and  simple  task  which  can  be  carried  out

by  linguistic  personnel  themselves  after  a  brief  braining  per¬ 
iod.  The  MACRO  instructions1  are  converted  into  direct  assembly 
language,  allowing  communication  with  the  computer  in  the  lan¬ 
guage  closest  to  the  computer,  thereby  making  full  use  of  the

logical  capabilities  and  the  available  high  speed  core  of  the

Op. cit . ,  p.  14. 


There  are  two  further  prime  considerations  in  discussing 
machine  translation.  One  is  time:  "The  need  for  virtually  im¬ 
mediate  translation  is  one  of  the  major  reasons  for  concern  with 
machine  translation."-*  In  other  words,  given  a  choice  between 
overnight  machine  translation  and  a  human  translation  in  a  fort¬ 
night,  today's  scientist,  cognizant  of  the  problem  of  obsoles¬ 
cence  in  scientific  and  technical  writing,  will  tend  to  choose 
the  perhaps  less  elegant,  but  certainly  more  immediate,  auto¬ 
matic  translation. 

The  other  consideration  is  quality.  (Nida  and  Bar-Hillel 
have  both  remarked  that  the  level  of  quality  desired  is  relative 
to  the  user.)  For  example*  a  physicist  may  be  satisfied  with  a 
faithful,  if  labored,  transmission  of  concepts,  while  a  stylist- 
ician  will  require  the  idiom  of  the  target  language. 

SYSTRAN'S  listing  of  L.S.  compunds  and  idioms,  in  addition 
to  its  numerous  specialized  lexical  routines,  allow  the  linguist 
to  greatly  minimize  stilted,  too- literal  translations  by  making 
special  provisions  to  attain  translation  equivalency  for  idio¬ 
syncratic  units  or  constructions  as  well  as  for  individual  lexi¬ 
cal  items.  An  example  of  this  is  the  handling  of  the  Russian 
MOJNO  construction.  Consider  the  following  Russian  sentence: 

NEKOTORYE  FAKTY  MOJNO  UJE  SCITAT6  USTANOVLENNYMI . 

There  is  in  this  sentence,  no  overu  surface  subject,  since 


3pp. cit. ,  p.  6. 


97 


MOJNO,  an  impersonal  expression,  functions  as  subject  and  predi¬ 
cate.  A  literal,  word-by-word  translation  could  produce  the 
following: 

SOME  FACTS  (IT)  IS  POSSIBLE  (or  CAN)  ALREADY  TO  CONSIDER 

ESTABLISHED. 

Rearranging  that  translation  would  yield  the  following 
slightly  more  readable  sentence: 

IT  IS  POSSIBLE  TO  CONSIDER  SOME  FACTS  ALREADY  ESTABLISHED. 

SYSTRAN,  rather  than  supplying  an  impersonal  subject  such 
as  ONE  or  IT,  chooses  the  accusative  object  noun  to  serve  as 
surface  subject,  yielding  the  following  translation: 

SOME  FACTS  CAN  BE  CONSIDERED  ALREADY  ESTABLISHED. 

The  article  in  the  Soviet  publication,  Nau£no-Texniceskaja 
Informaci ja  (NTI) ,  analyzes  possible  criteria  which  may  be  de¬ 
veloped  to  evaluate  human  and  machine  translation.  It  stresses 
the  fact  that  no  real  attempt  has  been  made  to  objectively  eval¬ 
uate  automatic  and  human  translation.  It  also  stresses  the 
fact  that  human  translation  may  demonstrate  a  good  many  inade¬ 
quacies  which  usually  do  not  occur  in  machine  translation.  The 
smoothness  of  the  human  translation  in  comparison  to  the  rough¬ 
ness  of  machine  translation  usually  influences  any  evaluation 
adversely  against  the  latter.  The  article  elaborates  upon  me¬ 
thods  of  evaluating  translations  and  sets  up  various  evaluation 


98 


scales.  The  article  also  refers  to  the  English-Russian  machine 
translation  carried  out  in  the  Soviet  Union. 

Segments  of  this  article  which  have  been  translated  by 
SYSTRAN  are  given  below.  The  translation  reflects  present 
SYSTRAN  quality  resulting  from  a  careful  update  of  grammar  codes 
and  English  synthesis  codes.  The  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  high¬ 
ly  sensitive  algorithms  incorporated  into  SYSTRAN  can  carry  out 
their  tasks  only  if  the  entries  of  the  supporting  dictionaries 
are  correctly  supplied  with  all  the  necessary  grammar  codes.  A 
systematic  improvement  on  the  grammar  code  level  often  requires 
analysis  of  the  occurrence  of  certain  lexical  items  in  context, 
since  the  human  mind  is  incapable  of  determing  a  priori  all  the 
possible  syntactic  and  semantic  relationships  in  which  a  given 
entry  may  function.  The  translation  also  illustrates  where  fur¬ 
ther  refinements  are  necessary.  For  example,  in  the  sentence — 

3TA  PROQEDURA  NE  DAET,  ODNAKO,  OTVETA  NA  VOPROS,  KAK 

VLI4ET  TOT  ILI  INOx  TIP  OWIBKI  PEREVODA  NA  0B5UH  OQENKU 

KACESTVA. 

— the  Russian  preposition  NA  may  be  governed  by  the  noun 
PEREVOD  as  well  as  by  the  verb  VLI4T6.  Since  PEREVOD  immedi¬ 
ately  preceeds  NA,  SYSTRAN  recognized  it  as  the  governor  of  the 
preposition,  translating  the  preposition  as  INTO.  In  this  case, 
however,  the  requirement  of  the  verb  overrides  that  of  the  noun, 
and  the  translation  of  NA  should  have  been  suppressed. 

SYSTRAN'S  translation  is  presented  in  the  following  reduc¬ 
tions  of  actual  printouts.  The  output  reflects  a  1403  printout 


vw  v  rar'r  **«»•?  v'il 


/ 

rather  than  a  360  printout  which  does  not  possess  a  colon, 
semicolon  or  quotation  marks.  Consequently  where  such  punctua¬ 
tion  should  have  occurred,  blanks  occur  in  the  translation. 

Following  the  English  translation,  the  Russian  original,  which 
served  as  direct  input  to  SYSTRAN,  is  given. 

The  last  translated  paragraph  oi  the  Soviet  article  states 
that,  for  practical  translation  purposes,  a  full  dictionary  is 
indispensable,  implying  that  this  need  be  augmented  only  by  sim¬ 
ple  algorithms.  We  cannot  agree  with  this  statement.  Although 
a  full  dictionary  supplied  with  correct  grammar  codes  is  of 
great  importance,  simple  algorithms  cannot  carry  out  the  trans¬ 
lation  task.  SYSTRAN'S  algorithms  analyze  each  sentence  from 
every  possible  syntactic  point  of  view  and,  in  addition,  utilize 
a  certain  amount  of  semantic  information.  Previous  decisions 
are  reconsidered  repeatedly  as  a  coding  s  heme  of  about  100 
bytes  (800  bits)  is  built  up  after  each  word  to  express  the  nec¬ 
essary  syntactic  ties  between  the  members  of  each  sentence  and 
subsentence.  The  hierarchical  analysis  carried  out  by  the  algo¬ 
rithms,  which  use  sequences  of  subroutines  and  nested  subrou¬ 
tines  to  carry  out  high  level  logical  decisions,  can  be  called 
anything  but  simple, 

SYoTRAN ' s  most  powerful  feature,  however,  is  the  open- 
endedness  of  these  sophisticated  algorithms  which  makes  them 
amenable  to  further  refinement.  These  refinements  can  be  made 
continually  at  either  the  syntactic  or  semantic  level.  It 

should  be  kept  in  mind,  however,  that  syntax  and  semantics  > 

j 

i 


100 


are  so  closely  interrelated  that  the  construction  of  any  ade¬ 
quate  grammar  will  require  that  as  much  care  be  devoted  to  the 
development  of  the  semantic  component  as  is  given  the  syntactic 
component.  SYSTRAN'S  present  stage  of  sophistication  makes  it 
abundantly  clear  that  semantics  can  and  must  be  accounted  for 
in  an  automatic  recognition  grammar.

THE  AUTOMATION  CF  THE  TRANSLATION  OF  TEXTS. 


THE  EVALUATION  OF  THE  QUALITY  OF  MACHINE 


TRANSLATION. 


V.  A.  Me  sKov i eh  t  S.  M.  Vishnyakova . 

The  purpose  of  the  work  is  the  definition  of  the  acceptable  and 
permissible  quality  of  machine  translation  provided  both  to  postediting  and 
to  direct  distribution  without  postediting.  Such  a  study  must  be  conducteo 
for  the  clarification  of  the  possibility  of  the  practical  use  of 
experimental  systems  of  machine  translation  ( MT )  and  for  the  formulation  of 
requirements  for  the  quality  of  the  translation  which  should  be  ensured  by 
the  improved  algorithms  of  MT. 

The  question  of  the  permissible  quality  of  machine  translation  i9 
today  one  of  the  central  questions  of  the  theory  and  practice  of  MT f  whose 
solution  will  in  many  respects  contribute  the  substantiated  prediction  of

further  works  in  this  field*  ... 

The  results  of  these  works  in  the  evaluation  of  the  quality  of 
translation  do  not  make  it  possible  to  give  a  clear  answer  to  the  question 

placed  in  these^works:  how  satisfactory  is  machine  translation  being

obtained  today?  On  the  basis  of  these  works  it  is  possible  to  make  only 
that  conclusion,  that  the  texts  machine  translated,  according  to  ail 
characteristics  are  inferior  to  the  texts  translated  by  man* 

In  connection  with  this  conclusion  let  us  note  our  difference  of 
opinion  with  the  being  practiced  in  abovement ioned  and  similar  to  them

translated  by  people,  and  the  texts  machine  translated.  The  fact  is  that 
in  the  absence  of  the  preliminary  attribution  of  translation  to  a  certain' 
qualitive  class  it  i3  difficult  to  judge,  what  the  text  of  the  translation 
sets  forth*  Up  to  now  a  basis  for  the  comparison  of  the  qualitative 
characteristics  of  ordinary  and  machine  translation  i3  absent.  It  is 
unclear  how  is  differed  the  mao. me  translation  from  the  ordinary,  human 
translation  can  possess  a  mass  of  deficiencies  which  can  in  principle  be 
absent  from  machine  translation  (for  example  the  hypertrophy  of  the

structure  of  human  translation  (even  with  its  incomprehensibility)  can 
influence  the  subjective  evaluation  of  the  test  subjects  towards

■  1 

peculiar  to  machine  translation*  but  unusual  to  man*  can  sharply  lower  the

evaluation  of  translation  for  his  clarity. 

i 

1  i  i  _  : 

In  this  way*  none  of  the  previous  works  in  the  evaluation  of  the 

i 

quality  of  translation  can  be  recognized  satisfactory  in  every  respect. 

t  ! 

When  developing  the  procedure  of  the  evaluation  of  the  quality  of  the 

i 

translations  of  patent  texts  it  was  necessary  to  anew  develop  all 
procedure^  of  experiments,  taking  into  account  all  that  is  rational*  which 

was  proposed  in  the  works  of  our  predecessors. 

i 

The  principles  placed  a3  the  basis  for  the  procedure  developed  by  us* 

are  reduced  to  the  following:  1)  the  clear  differentiation  of  three 

1 

j  ,  I 

independent  parameters  of  the  measurement  of  the  quality  of  the 

I 

translation:  the  clarity  of  translation*  correctness  of  the  communication 


of  the  sense  of  original  in  translation  and  acceptability  of  translation  as

a  whole;  2)  the  carrying  cut  of  the  experiments  with  texts  which  are 
characterized  only  by  some  single  type  of  distortions;  3)  the  absence  in 
the  experiments  of  human  translations;  4)  the  neutralization  of  the 
factors,  capable  of  distorting  the  real  evaluation  of  translation;  5)  the 
utilization  of  the  scales  with  the  optimum  scale  of  the  gradation  of 
indicators;  6)  the  development  of  the  positive  establishment  of  the  test 
subjects  for  machine  translation  before  the  beginning  of  an  experiment. 

The  parameters  of  the  measurement  of  the  quality  of  translation  chosen 
by  us  are  differed  by  relative  independence  and  the  important  aspects  of 
the  translation  characterize;  its  clarity,  the  faithfulness  to  the 
ori.glnal  and  its  acceptability.  The  clarity  of  translation  is  basic  from 
the  evaluated  parameters  of  the  quality  of  translation.  To  measure  it  is 
possible  according  to  the  scales  of  the  subjective  evaluations  of  the" 
clearness  of  the  sense"  of  translation. 

The  second  parameter  of  the  evaluation  of  the  quality  of  translation  - 
its  faithfulness  to  the  original  -  is  in  principle  independent  from  the 
first  parameter,  it  is  also  measured  on  the  basis  of  the  subjective

Finally,  the  third  parameter  -  the  acceptability  of  translation  --  is 
the  derived  from  the  first  two.  In  its  measurement  being  accomplished  sj  so 
according  to  the  scale  of  subjective  evaluations,  it  is  desirable  to 
refine,  under  which  conditions  the  evaluated  translation  can  prove  to  be 
useful  for  the  reader. 

For  our  purposes  the  f i ve-or-3 ix-poin t  scale  of  evaluations  will  be 
most  appropriate.  it  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  all  the  essential 
gradations  of  the  indicator  being  studied  and  possesses  a  sufficient  degree 
of  generality  (5).  To  evaluate  the  clarity  of  translation  we  use  the 
following  scale  of  evaluations: 

-  the  sense  of  the  entire  text  i3  clear  and  it  causes  no  doubts; 

-  the  sense  of  a  text  is  clear,  however  single  sentences  require  some 
reflections; 

-  only  overall  meaning  of  a  text  13  clear; 

-  the  overall  meaning  of  a  text  is  understood  with  difficulty; 

-  the  sense  of  a  text  is  absolutely  unclear. 

as  a  control  procedure  for  the  checking  of  evaluations  the  following 
method  is  used  by  us.  The  test  subjects  underline  the  unclear  to  them

places  of  translation  and  copy  a  text,  correcting  the  emphasized  places  of 
t  rans 1  at i on* 

The  evaluation  of  the  faithfulness  of  translation  to  original  is  also 
produced  by  us  according  to  the  five-point  scale  of  evaluations. 

Evaluations  are  formulated  in  the  form  of  these  definitions: 

-  translation  transmits  very  well  tne  sense  of  original; 

-  translation  transmits  well  the  sense  of  original; 

-  translation  in  its  largest  part  correctly  transmits  the  sense  of 
original ; 

-  translation  in  its  largest  part  correctly  transmits  the  sense  of 
original; 

-  translation  in  no  way  transmits  the  sense  of  original. 

When  evaluating  the  acceptability  of  translations  to  the  test  subjects 
it  is  proposed  to  select  one  of  the  six  versions  of  the  answer; 

1.  I  consider  expedient  the  practical  use  of  such  translations  in  the 
unedited  form  on  the  condition  that  the  system  of  machine  translation  to 
provide  for  the  essential  reduction  of  the  periods  of  the  output  of  signal 
informat  ion.

2*  I  consider  expedient  the  use  of  3uch  translations  under  the 
condition  of  a  representation  along  with  the  translation  of  a  draft. 

3.  I  consider  expedient  the  use  of  such  translations  under  the 
condition  of  a  representation  along  with  the  translation  of  the  original 
text  and  draft. 

4.  I  consider  expedient  the  use  of  such  translations  after  their 
insignificant  editing. 

5.  I  consider  expedient  the  use  of  3uch  translations  even  after  their 
essential  editing. 

6.  I  consider  inadvisable  the  use  of  such  translations  both  in  edited 

and  in  the  unedited  form. 

In  the  course  of  experiments  in  the  evaluation  of  the  quality  of 
translations  according  to  three  proposed  above  parameters  were  used  the 
standard  translations  of  the  texts  of  the  points  of  the  patent  formulas 
from  the  week'y  of"  official  gazette",  executed  by  the  experimental  system 
of  Ang lo-Puss i an  machine  translation  of  QNIIPJ  by  a  computer"  ural-4". 

Since  in  these  texts  the  different  types  of  the  errors  of  translation  have 
been  presented  in  a  composite  form,  it  is  difficult  to  judge  as  to  what

degree  one  or  another  type  of  error  affects  of  translation#  Therefore  in 

i  '  i 

i 

one  of  the  series  of  experiments  in  the  evaluation  of  the  quality  of 

.  ’  i 

translation  -  when  evaluating  the  faithfulness  of  translation  to  original  - 

t 

the  supplemental  procedure  has  been  introduced  which  makes  it  possible  to 

1 

judge  as  to  what  extent  the  different  types  of  the  errors  of  translation 
have  been  presented  in  the  evaluated  text  of  translation.  To  the  test 
subjects  it  is  proposed  to  underline  in  the  text  of  translation  the 

1  i 

incorrect  translations  of  terms  by  two  features*  grammatical  errors  by  a 
dotted  line  and  stylistic  errors  -  by  a  wavy  line.  This  procedure  does  not 
give*  however*  an  answer  to  the  question  how  influences  one  or  another  type 
of  error  in  translation  into  the  general  eval uat ion'  of  quality. 

i 

Therefore  as  text  materials  specially  prepared  semi-automatic

translations  are  used  by  us  also.  Each  of  these  translations  is  differed 
only  by  one  type  of  evaluation.  In  .expert  ments  the  semi-ajitomat  ic

At  the  beginning  of  experiments  the  positive  establishment  of  the  test 

subjects  with  respect  to  the.  machine  translation  was  attained*  For  this  to

of  its  grammatical  and  stylistic  correctness.  The  appropriate  explanations 
were  introduced  into  the  text  of  interrogatory  forms. 

Our  experiments  were  produced  by  two  series.  In  the  first  series  the

texts  of  semi-automatic  and  machine  translation  were  presented  to  the  test

subject  directly  by  experimenters.  In  the  second  series  an  experiment  was 
that  the  test  subjects  answered  the  form  according  to  the  evaluation  of  the 
quality  of  translation  externally.  In  this  form  the  texts  of 
semi-automatic  translation  were  not  included*  in  it  were  presented  only  the 
texts  translated  by  a  computer.  Form  was  published  in  a  periodical  the" 
questions  of  invention"*  1968*  ho.  5. 

At  the  present  time  materials  on  the  first  series  of  experiments  have 
been  obtained.  On  the  second  series  of  experiments  material  has  been 
processed  partially.  ... 

In  this  way  it  is  possible  to  infer,  that  to  the  greatest  degree  the 
untranslated  vocabulary  and  to  the  smallest  degree  -  the  destroyed 
grammatical  connections  in  part  of  the  text  make  the  quality  of 
translations  worse*  The  unsolved  grammatical  and  lexical  homonymy  makes 
the  translation  to  a  lesser  degree  worse.  Consequently,  in  order  to  attain 
the  optimum  quality  of  translation  it  is  necessary  under  otherwise  equal 
conditions  to  provide  for  the  system  of  machine  translation  with  the  full 
dictionary*  in  which  the  entire  vocabulary  of  the  texts  being  translated  is 
included.  The  percentage  of  the  words*  not  found  in  a  dictionary*  should 


lOlj 


02-12-72  PAGE  11 

regain  at  the  lowest  level*  The  translation*  intelligible  to  the  reader* 
can  provide  for  the  comparatively  simple  algorithm  which  works  on  the  basis 
of  a  full  dictionary.  This  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  the  text  of 
word-by-word  translation  and  the  text  of  the  translation  with  grammatical 
agreement*  obtained  by  a  computer,  have  identical  evaluations.  Exponential 
in  this  plan  is  the  fact  that  the  ignoring  of  the  connections  between  the 
components  of  nominal  word  combinations*  and  also  unsolved  grammatical 
homonymy  influence  the  quality  of  translation  to  the  smallest  degree. 

Our  conclusion  in  a  somewhat  different  form  has  been  repeated.  With 
the  complication  of  the  algorithms  of  the  syntactic  text  analysis  which 
have  as  a  goal  the  detection  and  the  correct  transfer  of  the  grammatical 
connections  of  the  text  of  original*  the  degree  of  the  clarity  of  the 
translations  being  obtained  substantially  does  not  increase.  For  practical 
purposes  a  simple  algorithm  is  sufficient*  but  a  full  dictionary  i3 
necessary.  SUBJECT  CODE  0.

SECTION  VI 


SYSTRAN  AND  THE  CONTROVERSY  ABOUT  THE 
STATE  OF  THE  ART 

Dispute  or  controversy  about  the  feasibility  of  machine 
translation  continues  to  manifest  itself,  despite  the  findings 
of  the  197C-1971  study  effort  of  American  linguists  and  despite 
the  findings  of  respected  Soviet  experts „  The  latest  contribu¬ 
tion  to  this  controversy  appeared  in  the  December,  1971  issue 
of  the  journal  Science  in  the  form  of  a  letter  to  the  editor 
from  H.  W.  Sinaiko. 

The  approach  in  this  letter  depends  on  the  writer's  offer 
of  statistics  in  the  form  of  percentages  of  "errors"  in  MT  — 
percentages  arrived  at  by  the  writer  by  some  unexplained  method. 
The  thrust  of  the  letter  is  certainly  negative,  even  though  the 
writer  admits  that  "it  would  be  unwise  to  conclude  on  a  less- 
than-optimistic  note  because  of  one  set  of  observations."  None¬ 
theless,  Sinaiko 's  opinion  that  the  "differences  between  the 
1964  and  1971  MT  systems  v/ere  found  to  be  slight  and  not  con¬ 
sistently  favoring  one  or  the  other  system"  is  certainly  a  less 
than  optimistic  answer  to  the  writer's  apparently  rhetorical 
question:  "what  have  we  gotten  for  our  money?" 

This  brusque  question  is  apparently  not  an  inquiry  of  pro¬ 
gress  made  in  the  state  of  the  art,  but  a  prelude  to  the  negation 
of  progress  in  MT.  As  such,  it  deserves  close  examination. 


The  first  point  made  in  the  letter  is  that  the  same  article 
was  translated  by  a  1964  MT  system  and  by  a  1971  system.  The 
article  in  question  was  a  paper  (to  be  read  in  Yugoslavia  in 
1964)  written  in  English,  and  translated  into  Russian. 

No  mention  is  made  of  mistakes  made  by  the  human  translator 
in  producing  the  Russian  version.  There  were,  however,  errors 
in  the  Russian  translation — errors  which  detrimentally  affected 
the  computer's  re translation  into  English.  The  futility  of 
such  an  exercise  should  be  considered  at  this  point.  MT  is  de¬ 
signed  for  practical  purposes;  it  has  oeen  developed  to  pro¬ 
vide  rapid  and  accurate  translation  of  primarily  scientific  texts 
for  scientists  who  do  not  read  the  source  language.  It  has  not 
been  meant  to  serve  as  an  academic  merry-go-round  of  trans- 
lingualism. 

Nonetheless,  if  humans  want  to  use  MT  for  such  academic 
exercises,  MT  will  serve,  if  the  human- translation  input  is 
grammatically  and  orthographically  correct.  Unfortunately,  this 
was  not  the  case  with  the  article  in  question. 

Concrete  evidence  is  offered  here  for  the  purpose  of 
pointing  out  the  necessity  for  using  genuine  Russian  material 
in  cases  where  the  machine  translation  effort  is  to  demonstrate 
re compensation  to  the  investor.  It  is  also  intended  to  sub¬ 
stantiate  the  claim  that  SYSTRAN  has  been  developed  solely  for 
practical  use. 

The  Sinaiko  document  was  submitted  to  a  native  Russian, 

Dr.  P.  F.  Krasnopolsky ,  who  on  the  basis  of  his  long  teaching 


experience  in  the  United  States,  where  he  has  been  dealing 
with  both  the  Russian  and  the  English  languages,  is  well 

i 

qualified  to  judge  the  use  of  his  native  tongue  and  to  deter- 

i 

mine  the  instances  where  it  is  not  used  properly  or  where  it 
does  not  correspond  to  the  standard  literary  language  in  which 

i 

a  native  Russian  naturally  expresses  his  thoughts  on  paper. 

The  discrepancies  found  by  Dr.  Krasnopolsky  range  from  incorrect 
use  of  Russian  (perhaps  due  to  insufficient  grammar  training) , 
to  "Americanisms"  and  even  Russian  substandard  expressions.  For 
a  detailed  analysis  of  the  errors  found  in  the  Russian  text 
(sixty-five  distinct  and  non- repetitive  errors) ,  see  Appendix  III. 

In  brief,  most  of  the  errors,  inadequacies  and  inaccuracies 

'  _  ! 

of  the  text  indicate  a  poor  knowledge  of  the  Russian  language. 

In  addition,  the  Russian  text  serves  as  an  excellent  example 
of  the  types  of  errors  human  translators  may  make. 

One  of  the  most  typical  and  unavoidable  characteristics 
of  human  translation  is  the  inevitable  tendency  towards  slight 
semantic  discrepancies.  These  are  inevitable  because  the 
human  translator  unconsciously  carries  to  each  text  he  trans- 

i 

lates  his  own  prejudices  and  his  own  unique  system  of  semantic 
associations.  This,  rather  than  an  inadequate  knowledge  of 
Russian,  may  account  for  the  translation  from  the  English 
"seemed  to  be  .  „  .  slow"  (p.  4)  into  the  Russian  BYL  MEDLEN 
which  means  "was  slow."  Obviously,  KAZALS4  MEDLENNYM  ("seemed 

i 

.  .  .  slow")  should  have  been  used  to  achieve  a  precise 


SSSWSWaMi&i'M.**  tnamvi 


i 

translation.  Clearly,  that  something  seems  to  be  the  case 
does  not  logically  imply  that  it  is  the  case.  Yet,  in  the 
article  in  which  this  imprecise  translation  occurs,  Sinaiko 

states  that  with  human  translators  "meaning  was  preserved 

!  , 

with  high  fidelity."  One  can  only  conclude  that  this  optimum 

;  I 

condition  does  not  always  hold.  . 

.  I 

Ironically,  the  'abovementioned  errors  in  the  human- 

i 

produced  Russian  translation  of  Sinaiko' s  article  actually 
bear  witnes's  to^YSTRAN's  sophistication  in  machine  transla¬ 
tion.  Words  wfyich  do  not  exist  in  the  language  cannot  be 
.expected  to  be  translated,  disrupted  syntactical  structures 

I  i  ,  ! 

i  in  the  source  language  cannot  yield  normal  sentences  in  the 

target  language,  ai>d,  above  all,  no  computer  can  infer

anything  during  the  structural  analysis  which  is  not  explicitly 

expressed  in  the  input.  If  the  input  deviates  from  the 

i  •  i 

standard  use  of  a  language,  updates  must  be  carried  out  prior 

i 

to  spinning  the  tape.  Any  such  deviation1  forced  upon  such  an

operational  system  as  SYSTRAN  will  jeopardize  its  capabilities 
and  will  only  produce  adverse  effects. 

1  i 

Sinaiko  chooses 'as  indices  of  translation  efficiency 

I 

what  he  terms  "characteristics  of  MT  output,"  which  are 

i  1 

"(i)  untranslated  words  and  (ii)  translated  words  that  have 

i  • 

two  or  more  possible  meanings  in  the  target  language  (English 
in  this  case).’5  It  is  by  the  use  of  these  indices  that  the 

"The  MT  (1^64)  translation

f 

'  Unfortunately,  he  gives  no  indication  of  the  miscellany

i 

I  38  out  of  the  1,685  words  in  the  text  were  not  translated  in 

IMT  1971;  four  were  not  translated  because  they  were  misspelled. 
In  other  words,  the  computer  correctly  rejected  human  error. 

Of  the  remaining  34  untranslated  words,  the  following  were 
counted  as  untranslated  more  than  once; 


WIDE  (2) 
NAX0DILS4  (2) 
TELEK0NFERENQI4  (9) 
KOLEBALAS6  (2) 


At  this  point,  two  facts  should  be  taken  into  account; 

(1)  as  long  as  people  create  new  vocabulary  items  (e.g., 
TELEK0NFERENQI4) ,  dictionary  updates  will  be  required  for 
their  translation.  Fortunately,  an  MT  system  dictionary 
can  be  updated  incredibly  quickly.  (2)  Words  may  remain 
untranslated  by  a  human  translator  if  he  is  not  equipped  to 
deal  with  terms  in  a  specialized  area.  Just  as  a  human  trans¬ 
lator  expert  in  a  specific  field,  e.g.,  thermodynamics,  is 
sought  to  translate  a  paper  in  that  field,  so  myst  an  MT  system 
be  equipped  by  dictionary  updates  (and  special  provisions  for 
subject  areas)  to  deal  with  current  articles  in  specified 
fields.

SYSTRAN  is  equipped  with  ten  Topical  Glossaries  to  deal 
with  texts  in  special  topical  areas.  (Telecommunication  is 
not  one  of  these  areas.)  When  it  does  encounter  words  it  is 
not  equipped  to  translate,  its  Not- Found  Word  Program  analyzes 
the  endings  of  these  words  so  that  the  output  can  indicate  the 
part  of  speech  and  sentence  function  of  the  untranslated  word. 
In  other  words,  the  word  does  not  remain  simply  "untranslated"; 
it  is  analyzed  as  far  as  this  is  possible  in  spite  of  the 
absence  of  a  translation  equivalent. 

Sinaiko's  other  index  of  translation  efficiency,  multiple 
meanings,  also  requires  a  fair  amount  of  discussion.  First, 
it  must  be  pointed  out  that  "multiple  meanings",  as  he  uses 
the  term,  refers  to  the  appearance  in  the  translated  output 
of  a  series  of  words,  separated  by  slashes,  any  one  of  which 
may  be  chosen  as  a  preferred  translation  equivalent  by  the 
post-editor.  In  other  words,  this  slashed  entry  format  was 
used  as  a  convenience  for  post-editing.  This  type  of  trans¬ 
lated  output  is  initiated  by  Subject  Code  D,  which  is  a 
special  utility  of  SYSTRAN,  rather  than  an  integral  feature. 
When  Subject  Code  D  is  not  selected,  only  one  meaning,  the 
meaning  appropriate  to  the  context,  will  appear  in  the  trans¬ 
lated  sentence.  Other  possible  meanings  for  the  homograph 
appear  at  the  end  of  each  sentence  in  the  hexadecimal  printout. 

Sinaiko  also  neglected  to  explain  how  he  arrived  at  his 
statistics  (5.3  percent  multiple  meanings).  Again,  many 


107 


occurrences  of  multiple  meanings  were  counted  more  than  once, 
just  as  the  untranslated  words  were  counted  more  than  once: 


TRANSLATION/TRANSFER  (27) 
EXPERIMENT/EXPERIENCE  (16) 
CONNECTION/BOND/RELATION  (  9) 
RATE/VELOCITY  (  8) 
POSSIBILITY/CAPABILITY  (  4) 
REACH/ATTAIN  (  4) 
AREA/DOMAIN  (  2) 
COMPRISE/CONSTITUTE  (  2) 
DIRECTION /TREND  (  2) 
SEVERAL/SOMEWHAT  (  2) 


The  letter  contained  two  more  observations  about  MT/1971 
which  further  reflected  Sinaiko's  negative  opinion  of  the 
progress  of  MT: 

(1)  "each  of  the  approximately  80  English  sentences  had 
had  some  editorial  modifications,  most  of  them  extensive"; 

(2)  "the  rate  of  post- translation  editing  was  slightly 
less  than  the  rate  of  human  translation. " 

He  does  not  define  "post-translation  editing"  nor  "exten' 
sive."  Even  the  most  fervid  proponents  of  MT  admit  the  MT 
produces  stylistically  rough  translations.  Any  sentient 
editor,  given  a  free  hand,  will  be  anxious  to  add  these 
stylistic  corrections.  Editing  of  this  sort  might  have  been 
extensive,  from  Sinaiko's  viewpoint,  especially  since  the  MT 
translation  he  saw  in  March,  1971,  was  carried  out  in  the 
midst  of  a  scheduled  improvement  phase  which  lasted  through 
the  following  month.  At  that  time,  routines  were  being 
rewritten  and  had  not  yet  been  checked  out.  For  this  reason, 


108 


several  L,  S.  compounds  were  not  recognized,  rearrangement 
did  not  go  into  effect,  and  article  insertion  was  suppressed. 
In  sum,  the  translation  on  which  he  bases  his  figures  was 
not  produced  by  a  fully  operating  system,  but  rather  by  a 
temporarily  disrupted  system. 

It  is  difficult  to  discuss  post-editing  time  requirements 
because  there  are  various  types  of  post-editing,  requiring 
greater  and  lesser  amounts  of  time. 

For  example,  a  post-editor  who  checks  translated  output 
for  clarity  of  expression  in  the  target  language  makes  very 
few  corrections,  and  those  are  only  the  ones  he  considers 
most  necessary,  if  he  wishes  to  forward  it  to  scientists  to 
be  read  immediately.  If  the  need  is  less  urgent,  he  may  add 
stylistic  changes. 

On  the  other  hand,  if  the  post-editor  is  a  bilingual 
checking  the  fidelity  of  the  translated  output  to  the  source 
text,  then  his  editing  will  take  at  least  as  much  time  as 
he  would  originally  have  needed  to  translate  each  sentence 
himself,  since  he  must  actually  translate  the  source  text 
to  compare  it  to  the  target  text.  However,  once  a  system 
is  in  operation,  this  latter  type  of  post-editing  is  usually 
performed  only  on  specific  problems  in  specific  sentences, 
when  these  problems  occur.  The  sentence  by  sentence  compar¬ 
ison  will,  of  course,  be  done  by  the  experts  who  develop  the 
system,  as  they  continually  improve  MT.

I 


The  focal  point  of  this  discussion  is  a  paper  written 
in  English  by  Sinaiko  and  anonymously  translated  into  Russian. 
Appendices  I  and  II  contain  the  original  English  text  and 
the  translated  Russian  text.  SYSTRAN'S  translation  of  the 
Russian  is  given  below.  This  translation  was  done  in  Decem¬ 
ber,  1971.  (Although  this  translation  was  done  nine  (9)> 
months  after  the  text  Sinaiko  analyzed,  it  should  be  logically 
apparent  that  the  progress  made  in  MT  between  March  and  i 
December  of  1971  could  not  exceed  the  progress  made  between 
1964  and  1971.) 

) 

While  Sinaiko1 s  translated  text  makes  quite  clear  the 

time  entailed  in  human  translation,  since  his  letter  to 

1 

Science  implies  the  definite  preferability  of  human  transla-  , 

I 

tors,  LATSEC,  INC.,  employed  a  professional  translator  (who 

has  translated  professionally  from  Russian  to  English  since  i

196  3)  to  translate  the  same  text  .that  was  submitted  to  SYSTRAN 

>  1 

The  initial  translation  was  done  on  a  dictaphone  and  took  i 

*  I 

100  minutes.  After  it  was  typed,  the  translator  then  spent 
15  minutes  "post-editing"  his  own  work.  The  material  was 
retyped,  and  then  edited  to  achieve  a  smoother  English  text. 

i  • 

Three  hours  had  elapsed  since  the  material  was  first  presented 
to  the  translator.  Needless  to  say,  SYSTRAN'S  translation  1 
was  accomplished  within  Minutes,  Specifically,  SYSTRAN 
translation  of  this  text  took  22.52  seconds  (CPU).  HoweVer, 
this  is  not  an  index  of  SYSTRAN'S  standard  words- per- minute

I nt  roduc t i on. 

Teleconferences  refer  to  the  meetings  of  people  who  are  located  far 
fro*  one  another  and  therefore  .must  use  any  means  for  long-distance 
communication.  At  teleconferences,  who  do  not  have  common  language  can 
also  be  the  participants.  This  report  sums  up  some  experimental  results 
conducted  in  the  field  of  the  teleconferences  which  specially  relate:  a) 
to  the  different  technical  methods  of  the  oral  and  written  translations, 
capable  of  being  requiring  at  international  teleconferences;  and  b)  to 
teleconferences,  that  use  the  different  means  of  communication.  **

Linguistic  experiments. 

Background  and  method.  Research  on  the  existing  materials  gave  no 
indications  that  in  order  that  in  the  past  practical  research  on  the 
technical  methods  used  would  occur  by  translators  and  interpreters  of 
foreign  languages.  Therefore  we  conducted  a  number  of  experimental 
observations  for  the  measurement  of  3ome  characteristic  properties  of 
translation  and  interpretation.  We  used  languages  English  and  French, 


because  they  predominate  on  international  conferences  and  since  the  highly

skilled  linguists  who  knew  both  languages,  they  were  available  as 
experimental  subjects*  The  material  which  translators  and  interpreters 
used,  it  was  political  in  content:  the  published  records  of  the  sessions 
of  the  Security  Council  of  united  nations*  During  each  experiment  we  noted 
the  productivity  of  the  linguists  from  the  point  of  view  of  Accuracy  and 
speed  expressed  by  a  number  of  words  per  minute*  Accuracy  was  evaluated  by 
the  judge-expert  who  used  the  criteria  of  the  state  department  used  during 
the  selection  of  the  professional  linguists. 

Results. 

We  studied  two  basic  linguistic  methods  and  several  of  their  versions. 
The  first  experiments  were  connected  with  the  generally  accepted  procedure 
of  full  translation*  Were  used  the  groups  of  translators,  some  from  French 
to  English,  and  others  from  English  to  French.  One  experiment  was 
dedicated  to  the  measurement  of  the  fuli  written  translation  being  produced 
in  the  normal  way*  The  results  showed,  that  for  full  translation  much  more 
time  was  necessary,  than  for  the  actual  session  of  united  nations*  ,  at  the 
session  of  united  nations  for  the  delivery  of  speeches  one  hour  of  time  was 
necessary  namely  approximately,  whereas  our  groups  of  translators  spent

37,6  is  watch  to  the  full  written  French  or  English  translation  of  these 
same  speeches*  the  full  translation  rate  comprised  on  the  average  5,4 
words  per  minute*  The  accuracy  of  full  translation  was  actually 
irreproachable:  on  the  average  it  attained  97o/o,  and  among  seven  of  each 
of  eight  excerpts  it  waverd  within  the  limits  between  96o/o  and  100o/o* 

During  another  experiment  we  placed  before  the  groups  of  translators 
linguistic  problems  in  reverse  order,  whereas  normally  in  English-french 
translators  a  native  language  is  French,  and  the  group  of  the  translators 
from  French  into  the  English  language  became  accustomed  to  work  only  in 
this  direction.  When  for  groups  it  was  necessary  to  wo;*k  under  uncommon 
conditions,  their  accuracy  was  somewhat  lowered,  especially  in  those  which

excerpts  was  small,  in  this  experiment  were  not  calculated  the  speeds  of 
translations;  however,  it  is  possible  to  say,  that  the  condition  the” 
reverse  linguistic  problem"  had  a  tendency  to  slow  down  the  work  of 
translators*  ). 

Has  also  produced  the  final,  but  short  experiment  which  was  concerning 
the  technical  methods  of  full  written  translati’on*  We  charged  to  groups  to 


llld 


02-12-72 


PAGE 


translate  back  into  the  initial  language  the  samples  of  the  already 
translated  excerpts.  Groups  worked  in  the  direction  of  the  languages 
preferred  by  them.  Accuracy  was  very  high:  it  attained  y6-100o/o. 

Numbers  of  words  per  minute  were  not  calculated,  but  reverse  translation 
into  the  French  language  required  less  time,  than  the  initial  translation 
into  English;  analogous  reverse  translation  into  English  was  slower  than 
the  translation  from  English  into  French. 

Since  for  teleconferences  the  ordinary  method  of  a  written  translation 
was  inadmissibly  slow,  we  developed  a  new  technical  method.  it  could  be 
used  in  teleconferences,  where  the  teletype  was  as  the  means  of 
communication.  Ue  called  this  method"  visual  x ranslat ion".  it  is  produced 
by  a  linguist  who  reads  in  one  language  being  obtained  information  and 
simultaneously  dictating  the  his  translation  to  a  typist  on  a  typewriter. 
Were  produced  three  experiments  on  visual  translation,  similar  to  the  those 
that  were  used  in  full  written  translation,  as  objects  we  used  oral 
professional  translators,  but  not  written,  because  this  method  is  based  on 
speed  and  rapid  memorization.  The  records  of  the  Security  Council  of 
united  nations  were  transmitted,  both  in  French  and  in  the  English  language 


llle 


02-12-72

with  the  aid  of  the  teletype  equipment  at  a  rate  of  60  words  per  minute. 

The  first  experiment  on  visual  translation  showed,  that  it  is  much 
faster  than  full  written  translation.  For  the  translation  of  the  one-hour 
session  of  united  nations  it  was  required  9,7  is  watch  (21  words  per 
minute).  Accuracy  was  very  high;  on  the  average  it  attained  94o/o,  and  in 
two  thirds  of  the  total  number  cf  excerpts  it  waverd  between  96o/o  and 
100o/o. 

During  another  experiment  we  placed  before  visual  translators  a 
reverse  linguistic  problem.  The  participating  translators  said  previously, 
that  they  will  have  the  bad  productivity  which  will  be  expressed  In  a  lower 
speed  and  the  larger  number  of  errors.  So  it  happened:  the  average 
accuracy  of  an  American  translator  was  only  84o/o,  but  of  born  in  France 
92o/o.  However,  the  speed  of  work  was  lowered  only  in  one  translator; 
another,  born  in  France,  translated  to  the  English  language  just  as  rapidly 
as  to  French. 

Finally  we  conducted  one  additional  short  experiment,  using  visual 
translation  for  the  reverse  translation  of  material  into  its  initial 
language.  Accuracy  was  just  as  high,  as  In  the  first  experiment  on  this

type  translation.  Although  the  sense  was  completely  preserved,  however, 

i 

not  all  reversely  translated  words  were  expressed  identicali'y  with  their 
initial  form.  Among  interesting  English  examples  it  is  possible  to 
mention,  that1’  terrible"  became"  howling","  shaking"  was  made"  waveing", 

and"  to  allcw  discussion"  wa3  turned  into"  to  permit  debates".  Relative  to

Background. 

I 

We  conducted  a  number  of  conferences  with  the  participation  of  the 

i 

groups  of  four  and  the  penta  of  the  man  who  were  located  far  from  one 
another  and  had  to  communicate  with  the  aid  of  teletype,  telephone  and  in 
only  one  instance  televisions.  With  the  exception  of  the  television  1 

experiment,  before  conferences  was  placed  the  problem  to  conduct 
negotiations.  The  participants  conducted  the  game,  during  which  they  had 
to  distribute  resources  among  the  group,  united  by  the  general  purpose,  a3, 
for  instance,  a  union,  but  to  every  object  were  given  different  secret 
instructions.  Every  conference  was  conducted  within  the  framework  of  some

group*  In  which  one  person  spoke  only  in  French*  so  that  it  was  necessary 

to  use  a  translator.  For  the  purpose  of  training  we  had  also  several

i ntermedi a tes  between  these  extremes.  The  participants  of  conferences 
said,  that  they  have  a  possibility  of  manifesting  much  greater 
intractabH ity ,  using  teletype,  than  with  all  other  methods. 

For  the  conducting  of  negotiations  at  teleconferences  teletype  allowed 
the  determined  advantages  single  in  its  Kind.  First,  it  was  very  useful  to 
have  a  printed  record  of  all  informations.  In  the  second  place,  the  need 
for  composing  informations  for  a  transfer  on  teletype  assigned  on  the 
participants  of  conferences  a  Known  discipline,  which  does  not  always 
relate  to  direct  conversational  communication.  (However,  despite  the  more 
compressed  language,  accepted  at  teletype  conferences,  at  these  conferences 
of  agreement  they  were  attained  much  more  3low,  than  at  sessions  face  to 
face  or  on  a  telephone).  Thirdly,  on  some  teletype  networks  there  was  the 
present  possibility  of  a  bilateral  and  simultaneous  transfer  (for  example  A 
could  send  an  information  to  v  at  the  same  time  that  to  the  v  it  sent  it3 
notice  to  A).  This  possibility  had  advantages  as  compared  *  ith  the  other 
methods,  but  it  also  created  confusion,  disrupting  the  normal  sequence  of 
negotiations.  Fourthly,  in  the  case  of  the  centralized  teletype  network 
the  picture  which  indicated  the  great  potential  power  of  its  chairman  was

obtained.  it  had  an  absolute  control  over  who  with  whom  was  found  in 
telecommunication,  and  at  its  station  could  edit  the  passed  informations, 
them  detain  or  change  order.  Fifthly,  since  teletype  does  not  have  a 
mechanism  for  feedback  for  the  checking  the  fact  that  an  addressee  actually 
obtained  or  understood  sent  to  it  an  information,  that  for  the  achievement 
of  this  it  is  necessary  to  use  a  supplemental  procedure.  In  the 
negotiations  with  the  aid  of  the  oral  communication  ->f  confirmation  they 
are  transmitted  in  the  form  short  answers;  at  sessions  the  non-verbal 
confirmations  in  the  form  of  the  mimicry  or  gestures  are  face  to  face  also. 
Sixthly,  a  skillful  translator  was  able  bilaterally  to  visually  translate 
teletype  informations  (from  English  to  French  and  vice  versa),  which 
corrected  the  disadvantageous  position  of  the  non-English-speaking 
participant  of  conference  as  compared  with  others,  that  led  negotiations  in 
the  English  language.  Finally,  it  is  necessary  to  note,  that  at  the 
teleconferences  equipped  both  teletype  and  by  telephone  communication,  the 
participants  rarely  used  the  latter. 

Our  short  experiment  on  the  utilization  of  a  television  at  conferences 
detected  no  special  advantages  In  the  fact  that  the  persons  the  leading

negotiations  and  far  away*  can  see  being  located  each  other.  On  the 
contrary*  in  the  opinicn  of  the  participants  of  these  sessions  their  own 
mimicry  and  the  other  non-verbal  manifestations  only  contribute  the  delay 
of  the  work  of  conference*  having  distracted  the  attention  of  viewers.  The 
participants  of  conference  also  did  not  approve  of  the  television 
equipment*  in  which  they  could  see  not  only  those,  with  wnom  they  led  an 
interview*  but  also  themselves. 

Conclusion. 

In  the  corning  years  will  be  reached  the  large  technical  successes 
which  will  permit  the  groups  cf  the  far  being  located  people  to  confer  with 
each  other.  In  order  to  make  such  teleconferences  effective,  it  is 
necessary  to  learn  much  which  concerns  how  to  use  these  technical 
capabilities  with  the  greatest  benefit  for  humanity.  We  represented  a 
resume  about  the  last  preliminary  experiments  relating  to  two  little 
studied  factors  in  connection  with  tie  conferences  at  a  distance*  namely: 
to  the  linguistic  profession  and  means  01  communication.  The  ju3t  now 
obtained  experimental  resuits  which  were  here  mentioned*  they  can  be  as

guiding  landmarks  for  the  those  for  whom  in  the  near  future  it  is  necessary 
to  develop  the  procedures  of  teleconferences.  Furthermore,  we  think,  that 
we  succeeded  in  visually  confirming  the  practicability  of  the  experiments 
dedicated  to  the  variable  amounts  of  teleconferences,  we  hope,  that  the 
other  interested  ucenye-bixevicristy  will  study  by  these  problems  tied  with 
them.  It  is  completely  possible,  that  on  one  fine  day  such  a  meeting,  as 
today  international  congress,  will  be  conducted  in  the  form  teleconference 


and  each  of  us  will  sit  at  its  writing  desk  in  its  own  country

SYSTRAN'S  POSITION 

i 

A  grammar  can  be  used  to  teach  languages  or  to  analyze 
them.  The  use  of  a  machine  grammar  for  translation  has  one 

i  ' 

main  goal:  to  free  the  human  intellect  from  tedious,  mechani¬ 
cal  chores  in  order  that  it  may  pursue  its  proper  vocation — 
creativity.  .  i 

The  purpose  of  scientific  and  technical  translation  is  to 

I 

facilitate  the  rapid  transmittal  of  new  developments  in  human 
knowledge  from  one  country  or  one  culture  to  another.  Uniform 
translation  overcomes  language  barriers  and  individual  idio- 

i  ‘  '  •  ! 

syncratic  preconceptions.  Because  of  this,  it  can  be  a  valu¬ 
able  contributor  to  mutual  understanding  and  an  impetus  to 

1  i 

mutual  aid  in  development  through  the . sharing  of  ideas .  These 
two  conditions  are  probably  among  'the  most  important  pre¬ 
requisites  to  world  peace. 

Uniform  translation  can  best  be  achieved  by  machine 
rather  than  by  humans  for  several  reasons.  First,  a  computer 

has  no  "native"  language.  It  can  translate  equally  well  from 

,  •  \ 

language  A  to  language  B,  from  B  to  A,  or  from  X  to  Z.  Second, 
a  computer  has  no  preconceptions  or  cultural  biases  regarding 
any  language  it  deals  with,  or  regarding  the  people  who  speak 
the  language.  Third,  it  hasn't  .the  educational  limits  of 
humans.  It  can  store  almost  unlimited  information  from  any 


112 


I 


1  .  I 

number  of  subject  fields. i 

These  three  factors  must  inevitably  play  a  large  part  in 

i  i  i 

producing  unambiguous  information,  free  from  bias,  prejudice 
or  preconception.  A  grammar  which  is  instrumental  in  producing 

unambiguous  information  by  overcoming  language  barriers  can  be 

1  ; 

regarded  as  a  definitively  positive  asset  in  language  science. 

,  I 

Such  a  grammar  is  the  SYSTRAN  grammar.  '  i 

i  *  > 

SYSTRAN,  like  any  grammatical  theory,  must  be  tested  for 
adequacy'.  If  it  does  not  adequately  account  for  the  phenomena 

I 

it  purports  to,  it  should  be  modified  or  discarded.  Many  lin¬ 
guists  have  apparently  decided  that  the  most  efficient  way  to  . 
test  a  grammar  is  .  to  use  computers  (cf.  Woods,  Kuno,Hays,  etc.). 

I  . 

The  unbiased  computer  provides  the  best  evaluation  of  a 

grammar  because  it  blindly  carries  out  any  and  all  operations 

» 

specified  or  allowed  by  the  grammar,  delivering  up,  in  its 

S 

output,  all  possible  consequences  of  the1  theory  programmed 
into  .it.  The  computer  is  the  presiding  master  of  logic. 

I 

SYSTRAN  Was  designed  to  be  used  by  the  cbmputer.  for  trans¬ 
lation  purposes.  Therefore,  it  is, a  recognition  grammar.’  As 

» 

it  is  used  again  and  again  for  computer  translations,,  it  is 

constantly  tested  for  its  adequacy  in  accurately  transmitting 

information  from  Russian, to  English  with  fidelity  and  intelli- 

.  .  .  1  . 

gibility.  As  a  result  of  this  constant  testing,  SYSTRAN  is 

I  i 

continuously  modified  and  improved. 

SYSTRAN,  as  an  automatic  recognition  grammar  designed 
specifically  for  corftputei  use,  must  be  supplied  with  a 


113 


sufficient  number  of  well-organized  grammatical  and  semantic 
codes  in  order  that  it  may  carry  out  its  function.  These 
codes  must  be  designed  in  response  to  the  capabilities  and 
requirements  of  the  computer. 

The  most  obvious  example  of  grammatical  coding  specifical¬ 
ly  designed  for  the  computer  is  SYSTRAN'S  approach  to  part  of 
speech  categorization.  SYSTRAN  has  two  major  divisions: 
primary  parts  of  speech  and  secondary  parts  of  speech.  Primary 
and  secondary  part  of  speech  assignment  is  oriented  towards 
the  fullest  utilization  of  the  categorization.  For  example,  the 
Russian  pronouns  EGO,  EE,  and  IX  function  either  as  personal 
pronouns  or  as  possessive  pronouns.  In  many  instances  the 
three  function  in  the  same  way  in  the  source  language.  There¬ 
fore,  their  primary  part  of  speech  (POS)  is  POS78. 

When  the  target  language  equivalent  is  chosen,  it  becomes 
necessary  to  specify  which  6f  the  three  is  to  be  translated. 

For  this  purpose,  secondary  (BPQ)  parts  of  speech  are  assigned 
(7B=EE,  7C-EG0,  7D=IX) . 

The  design  of  the  SYSTRAN  grammar  also  allows  codes  to 
express  special  types  of  relationships  extending  over  several 
clauses.  For  example,  the  ESLI-TO  or  KOGDA-TO  logical  relation¬ 
ship  can  be  coded.  If  this  were  implemented,  when  SYSTRAN 
encountered  either  a  ESLI  or  KOGDA  clause,  it  would  simultan¬ 
eously  be  alerted  to  expect  a  TO  clause  later  in  the  sentence. 

It  then  could  use  this  type  of  information  in  establishing 
clause  levels  within  the  sentence  discussed  earlier  in  this 


114 


report  (II,  "A  Comparison  of  Human  and  SYSTRAN  Parsing" K 
These  codes,  if  implemented,  could  have  shown  that  the  ESLI 
clause  is  logically  related  to  the  preceding  clause  in  the 
sentence  quoted  from  Iordanskaja  (see  Figures  3  and  4).  In 
implementing  codes  of  this  sort,  it  first  must  be  determined 
what  linguistic  analysis  is  most  appropriate.  For  example, 
in  this  case,  the  linguistic  analysis  must  determine  if  ESLI 
is  logically  related  to  the  preceding  predicate  in  the  KOTOROE 
clause,  or  if  its  relationship  is  with  the  main  clause. 

The  point  to  be  made  here  is  that  SYSTRAN  is  ready  to 
devise  and  implement  codes  of  this  sort,  as  soon  as  SYSTRAN'S 
data  gathering  feature  compiles  a  sufficient  number  of  sentences 
to  allow  all  these  and  similar  problems  to  be  solved.  These 
data  can  then  be  analyzed  by  persons  trained  in  SYSTRAN  grammar 
concepts.  The  result  of  the  analysis  can  be  incorporated  into 
SYSTRAN,  thereby  further  improving  the  System.

SECTION  VIII 

THE  FUTURE  OF  MACHINE  TRANSLATION 

As  recently  as  1964,  Eugene  Nida  remarked  that  "despite 
the  enormous  storage  capacity  in  modern  computers,  they  are 

nevetheless  incredibly  less  complicated  than  the  human  brain, 

.  .  14  1 

which  has  approximately  10  cells."  In  equating  complexity 

with  the  number  of  cells  in  the  human  brain,  Nida  implied  that 

the  computer  was  less  complex  because  it  had  fewer  "cells." 

Less  than  a  decade  latex,  a  1971  prognostication  of  the  develop 

ment  of  the  computer  predicted  "radical  changes  ...  in  the 

area  of  mass  storage  technology.  Whichever  methods — lasers, 

holography,  magnetic  bubbles,  etc. — are  used,  they  promise 

greater  access  speeds  and  vast  storage  capacities — as  great  as 

1013  or  1014  bits."2 

In  effect,  computers  will  soon  have  memory  capacities 
equivalent  to  those  of  the  human  brain.  Such  an  eventuality 
requires  system  designs  able  to  make  the  most  efficient  use  of 
the  resources  soon  to  be  at  our  disposal.  SYSTRAN'S  open-ended 
design  anticipates  these  developments.

116 


In  the  following,  a  few  examples  will  be  given  to  show  how 
the  SYSTRAN  concept  can  use  such  expanded  memory  capacities  to 
improve  the  quality  of  machine  translation.  This  concept  has 
already  been  proven  to  be  valid  not  only  for  Russian-English 
translation  but  for  translation  between  other  source  and  target 
languages. 

The  first  step  will  be  the  development  of  a  much  more 
detailed  topical  glossarization  of  the  individual  entry  level 
and  of  the  compound  level.  The  compound  concept  will  be  expand¬ 
ed  to  include  interrupted  compounds,  thus  taking  into  considera¬ 
tion  the  mutual  interlocking  influence  of  several  words  irre¬ 
levant  of  the  position  of  occurrence. 

Presently,  an  operationally  oriented  semantic  categorization 
is  being  developed  within  SYSTRAN.  Such  categorization  makes  it 
possible  to  introduce  general  types  of  multiple-meaning  resolu¬ 
tions  by  determining  how  semantic  categories  carry  out  their 
influence  within  definable  syntactic  connections.  In  the  follow¬ 
ing  sentence  segments,  the  verb  RASTI  occurs  with  two  different 
meanings:  INCREASE  and  GROW.  The  choice  of  either  meaning  is 
dependent  upon  the  subject's  carrying  semantic  code:  "animate." 
In  the  first  example,  the  subject  TEMPERATURA  does  not  have  the 
"animate"  code;  consequently  the  translation  is  INCREASE.  In 
the  second  example,  the  subject  BAKTERII  carries  the  "animate" 
code;  therefore  the  translation  is  GROW.

The  SYSTRAN  dictionary  system  can  accomodate,  in  variable 
length  format  after  every  dictionary  entry,  up  to  2,048 
semantic  codes,  expressing  similar  types  of  semantic  categori¬ 
zation.  In  addition  to  recognizing  and  using  semantic  cate¬ 
gories  for  multiple  meaning  resolution,  SYSTRAN  also  makes  use 
of  contextual  information  and  has  inherent  capabilities  for 
resolving  semantic  ambiguities  on  the  contextual  level.  A 
typical  example  of  SYSTRAN'S  ability  to  retain  contextual  in¬ 
formation  is  the  retention  of  human  and  animate  codes  after  each 
sentence  is  analyzed. 

Such  codes  are  retained  for  the  last  sentence's  subject  or 
for  its  last  object — or  for  a  pronoun  if  it  occurred  at  the  end 
of  the  sentence.  The  code  is  placed  into  analysis  area.  This 
area  is  available  before  the  main  analysis  of  the  sentence.  If 
it  is  needed,  the  information  in  the  160  bytes  reserved  for  a 
hypothetical  zero  word  is  not  cleared  when  a  new  sentence  analy¬ 
sis  begins.  The  indication  not  to  clear  the  information  in  these 
bytes  is  given  by  the  "remembering"  routine  whenever  there  is  a 
necessity  to  transfer  information  from  one  sentence  into  another. 
With  the  help  of  this  contextual  feature,  SYSTRAN  can  easily 
decide  that,  in  a  specific  sentence  with  two  identical 


118 


I 

i 

pronouns,  one  EE  refers  to  an  inanimate  noun,  and  that  its 
translation  should  be  ITS,  while  the  second  pronoun  should  be 
HER. 

Once  a  pronoun  has  occurred,  and  semantic  codes  from  its 
noun  antecedent  have  been  transferred  to  it,  this  pronoun  can 
serve  as  an  originator  for  these  memory  codes. 

SYSTRAN  is  also  open  for  the  introduction  of  a  systematic 
remembering  feature  for  nouns  in  order  to  improve  the  selection 
of  definite  articles  during  translation.  Each  time  a  new  noun 
occurs  with  an  article,  it  will  be  remembered.  In  addition,  a 
remembering  count  can  be  introduced,  which  will  allow  the  estab¬ 
lishment  of  "weighting"  criteria.  In  other  words,  previous 
occurrences  of  nouns  under  analysis  can  be  "remembered"  to 
determine  how  often  it  occurred  with  definite  articles  and  how 
often  it  occurred  with  indefinite  articles,  or  without  articles. 

To  further  contextual  analysis,  SYSTRAN  can  easily  be  modi¬ 
fied  to  retain  whole  paragraphs  or  even  larger  text  segments  in 
the  high  speed  memory  in  computer  analyzed  form.  With  only 
150,000  bytes  of  additional  core,  up  to  50  sentences  can  be  kept 
ir.  the  memory  where  there  is  immediate  access  to  every  dic¬ 
tionary  code  in  the  source  or  target  language.  Moreover,  each 
word  in  these  fifty  sentences  would  carry  its  codes  in  the 
computer  intermediate  language. 

The  following  examples  demonstrate  the  sorts  of  distinctions 
SYSTRAN  is  potentially  able  to  make  in  choosing  an  appropriate 


translation  out  of  several  possible  meanings  for  a  given  lexical

EXPERIMENTS  IN  INTERNATIONAL 
TELECONFERENCING  * 


H.  Wallace  Sinaiko 


Introduction 


Teleconferencing  refers  to  meetings  among  people  who  are 
remote  from  one  another  and,  therefore,  must  use  some  means  of 
telecommunication.  There  may  also  be  some  participants  in  tele¬ 
conferences  who  do  not  all  share  a  common  language.  This  re¬ 
port  summarizes  some  of  the  results  of  experiments  on  tele¬ 
conferencing,  particularly  those  having  to  do  with:  a)  various 
language  interpretation  and  translation  techniques  that  might 
be  required  in  international  teleconferencing?  and,  b)  tele¬ 
conferences  using  different  media  of  communication.** 


Language  Experiments 


Background  and  Method.  Background  studies  failed  to  show 
any  previous  experimental  research  on  the  techniques  used  by 
language  translators  or  interpreters.  Therefore,  we  ran  a 
series  of  pilot  studies  to  measure  some  attributes  of  transla¬ 
tion  and  interpretation.  We  used  English  and  French  because

of  the  prominence  of  these  languages  in  international  conferen¬ 
ces  and  because  highly  skilled  linguists  who  knew  both  languages 
were  readily  available  as  experimental  subjects.  The  material 
handled  by  the  translators  and  interpreters  was  political  in 
content:  published  minutes  of  United  Nations  Security  Council 
meetings ,  In  each  of  the  experiments  we  scored  performance  of 
the  linguists  for  speed  —  expressed  below  as  a  words-per- 
minute  rate  —  and  accuracy.  Accuracy  was  rated  by  a  single 
expert  judge  who  followed  the  Department  of  State  criteria  used 
to  select  professional  linguists. 

Results.  We  studied  two  basic  language  techniques  and 
several  variations  of  each.  The  first  experiments  were  con¬ 
cerned  with  conventional,  full  translation  techniques.  Teams 
of  translators  were  used  —  one  doing  French-to-English  and  the 
other  English- to-French.  One  experiment  was  intended  to  measure 
full  translation  as  it  is  done  traditionally.  Results  showed 
that  the  time  required  to  do  full  translation  was  very  much 
longer  than  the  original  UN  meeting.  That  is,  in  the  UN  meet¬ 
ing  the  speeches  were  delivered  in  about  one  hour;  our  transla¬ 
tion  teams  spent  37.6  hours  to  fully  translate  the  same  speeches 
into  written  French  or  English.  The  full  translation  rate  aver¬ 
aged  5.4  words  per  minute.  The  accuracy  of  full  translation  was 
virtually  perfect:  average  ratings  were  97%  and  seven-eighths 
of  all  passages  were  scored  between  96%  and  100%. 

In  another  language  experiment  we  reversed  the  target  lan¬ 
guages  of  the  translation  teams.  That  is,  the  English-to-French 


team  had  translators  for  whom  French  was  the  native  tongue  and 
the  French-to-English  team  was  accustomed  to  working  only  in 
that  direction.  When  the  teams  were  required  to  work  in  these 
unaccustomed  directions  there  was  some  loss  of  accuracy ,  parti¬ 
cularly  for  the  English-speaking  team.  (Because  the  sample  of 
passages  translated  was  small,  no  translation  rates  were  com¬ 
puted  for  this  experiment;  we  can  report,  however,  that  the 
"reversed  target  language"  condition  tended  to  slow  down  the 
translators. ) 

A  final  brief  experiment  was  done  with  the  full  translation 
technique.  We  had  the  teams  re-translate  back  into  the  original 
languages  samples  of  already-translated  passages.  Teams  worked 
in  the  direction  of  their  preferred  target  languages.  Accuracy 
was  very  high:  all  passages  were  scored  96%  to  100%.  No  word 
rates  were  computed  but  re-translation  back  into  French  took 
less  time  than  the  original  translation  into  English?  similarly, 
retranslation  back  into  English  was  slower  than  the  English  to 
French  translations. 

Because  conventional  full  translation  seemed  to  be  un¬ 
acceptably  slow  for  teleconferences  in  which  the  medium  of 
communication  between  participants  was  teletype.  We  have  called 
the  technique  "sight  translation."  It  is  done  by  a  linguist 
who  reads  an  incoming  message  in  one  language  and  dictates  a 
simultaneous  translation  to  a  typist.  Tnree  experiments,  paral¬ 
leling  those  for  the  full  translation  technique,  were  done  on 
sight  translation.  We  used  professional  interpreters  as

subjects  rather  than  translators  because  the  technique  empha- 

t 

sizes  speed  and  short  term  memory'.  The  UN  Security  Council 
minutes  were  transmitted  via  60-word-per-minute  teletype  equip¬ 
ment,  both  in  French  and  English.  • 

1 

The  first  experiment  on  sight  translation  showed  it  to 
be  much  faster  than  full  translation.  The  one  fyour  UN  meeting 
required  9.7  hours  to  be  translated  (21  words  per  minute). 

i 

Accuracy  was  very  high:  the  average  score  was  94%  and  two- 
thirds  of  all  passages  were  rated  96%  to  100%. 

We  reversed  the  target  languages  of  the  sight  translators 

I 

in  another  experiment.  The  interpreter-subjects  themselves 

predicted  that  they  would  perform  poorly  in  terms  of  slower 

) 

rates  and  more  errors.  This  was,  in  fact,  what  happened: 
average  accuracy  scores  were  84%  and  92%  for  the  American  and 
native  French  interpreter,  respectively.  However,  translation 
rates  went  down  only  in  ,the  case  of  one  interpreter;  the  other- 
the  native  French  subject — worked  as  fast  into  English  as  he 
had  into  French.  ,

Finally,  we  conducted  one  short  experiment  using  sight 

i 

translation  to  re-translate  material  back  into  its  original 
language.  Accuracy  scores  were  as  high  as  in  the  first  sight  '  > 
translation  experiment.  Although  meaning  was  preserved  with 

I 

high  fidelity,  not  all  words  were  re-translated  into  their 

I 

original  identical  form.  Some  interesting  English  examples 

of  these  changes  are:  "flagrant”  became  "blatant,"  "tottering"

became  "vacillating,"  and  "to  allow  discussion"  became  "to

i  Telecommunications  Media  Experiments 

Background,  j  We  ran  a  series  of  conferences  among  groups 

i  ' 

of  four  and  five  people  who  were  remote  from  one  another  and 
who  had  to  communicate  using  teletype,  telephone,  or,  in  one 
case,  television.  With  the  exception  of  television,  these 
conferences  involved  a  negotiation  task.  .Participants  played 

1  '  i  11 

a  game  xn  which  they  had  to  allocate  resources  to  a  common 
group  goal,  as  in  an  alliance,  but  with  individual  differences 
in  the  secret  instructions  given, to  each  subject.  Each  confer¬ 
ence  was  conducted  with 1  some  'u^  jv  ./ ?  that  is,  the  group  goal 
was  to  be  met  as  soon  as  v  >ssible.

In  the  fourteen  ,econferences  we  ran  no  two  were  identi¬ 
cal  in  terms  of  ne  wo  k  structure f  chairmanship  role,  or  lan¬ 
guage.  Some  conferences  had  a  "party-line"  or  open  network: 
every  message  sjent  by  a  participant  was  received  by  all  the 
others.  Some  networks  were  highly  centralized  and  permitted 

I  .  ‘ 

a  conferee  to  address  himself  to  one  or  two,  but  not  all,  of 
the  others.  There  were  conference  chairmen  in  some  meetings 

;  i  ■ 

but  not  all.  We  ran  several  teleconferences  with  one  French- 
speaking  subject  in  the  group  so  that  an  interpreter  had  to 

I 

be  used.  We  also  ran  a  few  face-to-face  practice  conferences. 


1-5 


Results.  Conferees  preferred  to  bargain  using  the  most 


impersonal  communications  medium.  Teletype  was  most  preferred 
as  a  negotiation  medium  and  face-to-face  meetings  were  least 
popular.  Television  and  telephone  were  assessed  as  between 
these  extremes.  Conferees  said  they  could  take  much  tougher 
positions  using  the  teletype  than  with  any  of  the  other  tech¬ 
niques. 

Teletype  offered  certain  unique  advantages  to  negotiation 
teleconferences.  First,  the  accumulated  printed  record  of  all 
messages  was  useful.  Second,  the  need  to  compose  messages  for 
teletype  transmission  imposed  a  discipline  on  the  conferees 
not  necessary  in  direct  voice  communication.  (However,  in 
spite  of  the  generally  more  terse  language  used  in  the  tele¬ 
type  conferences,  these  meetings  were  much  slower  in  reaching 
solutions  than  the  face-to-face  or  telephone  meetings.)  Third, 
some  teletype  networks  provided  true,  two-way  simultaneous 
transmission  (e.g.,  A  could  send  a  message  to  B  at  the  same  time 
B  was  sending  a  message  to  A) .  This  capability  was  an  advantage 
over  other  media  but  it  also  created  confusion  by  disturbing 
the  normal  sequence  of  bargaining.  Fourth,  the  presence  of  a 
chairman  in  a  centralized  teletype  network  demonstrated  the 
tremendous  potential  power  of  such  an  individual.  Teletype 
chairmen  had  absolute  control  over  who  communicated  with  whom; 
the  chairmen  could  also  edit,  delete,  or  change  the  sequence 
of  messages  going  through  their  stations.  Fifth,  because 
teletype  has  no  built-in  feedback  mechanism  to  insure 


1-6 


that  the  addressee  of  a  message  has  actually  received  or  under¬ 
stood  what  was  sent  to  him,  this  must  be  done  procedurally. 
Acknowledgments  in  voice-mediated  discussions  are  easily  trans¬ 
mitted  by  brief  answers;  face-to-face  meetings  also  include  non' 
verbal  acknowledgments  such  as  facial  expressions  or  gestures. 
Sixth,  a  skillful  interpreter  was  able  to  handle  two-way  sight 
translations  of  teletype  messages  (English-to-French  and  vice 
versa)  which  put  a  non-English-speaking  conferee  at  no  obvious 
disadvantage  from  other  conferees  who  negotiated  in  English. 
Finally,  in  teleconferences  with  both  teletype  and  telephone 
available  to  them,  conferees  rarely  used  the  telephone  facili¬ 
ties  . 


Our  brief  experience  with  television  as  a  conference  medium 
showed  no  particular  advantage  in  having  remote  negotiators  see 
each  other.  On  the  contrary,  the  participants  in  this  meeting 
felt  that  their  own  facial  expressions  or  other  non-verbal 
behavior  might  have  hurt  the  progress  of  the  session  by  dis¬ 
tracting  the  viewer.  Also,  the  conferees  did  not  like  a 
television  arrangement  in  which  they  could  see  themselves  as 
well  as  the  other  parties  with  whom  them  were  talking. 

Conclusion 

The  next  few  years  will  bring  great  technical  advances 
enabling  groups  of  people  who  are  physically  remote  to  confer 
with  jne  another.  If  such  teleconferences  are  to  be  effective 


1-7 


a  good  deal  needs  to  be  learned  about  how  to  arrange  such 
technical  capabilities  for  optimum  human  use.  We  have  summar¬ 
ized  some  results  of  recent  preliminary  experiments  on  two 
areas  about  which  little  is  known  in  the  context  of  remote 
conferencing:  language  services  and  communications  media.  The 

immediate  tentative  results  reported  here  might  provide  some 
guides  to  people  who  have  to  arrange  teleconference  procedures 
in  the  near  future.  Beyond  this,  we  believe  we  have  demonstrat¬ 
ed  the  feasibility  of  experimentation  on  teleconferencing 
variables.  We  hope  that  other  interested  behavioral  scientists 
will  address  themselves  toward  these  and  related  problems.  It 
is  not  inconceivable  that  some  day  a  meeting,  such  as  today's 
International  Congress,  will  be  conducted  as  a  teleconference 
with  each  of  us  in  his  own  country  at  his  own  desk.

Chess as an antidote to distraction
Arguments used in promotion of chess often emphasize that the game helps train 
concentration and stimulates problem solving. In the era of information overflow, where 
the fear of missing out (FOMO) is a key driver in the social life among many people, 
particularly the young, could this present an opportunity for chess to be positioned as a 
tool for combating distraction?
At the beginning of April I was in the Swiss capital – Bern – for the celebration of 100 
years of FIDE. The Swiss, together with FIDE, put on a great show which included the 
procession of the FIDE’s torch relay in the centre of Bern, “something which we have 
never had in our city,” as the mayor said later.
A well thought out, well organised and well executed event (would you expect anything 
different from the Swiss?!), also included the celebration of 50 years since the formation 
of the Swiss Youth Chess Federation. The head of the organisation, Michael Hochstrasser 
gave a speech in which he highlighted what to me seems as the most obvious benefit of 
chess today for young people:
"Young people are exposed to too many distractions. Multitasking is a key word of our 
time. At the same time, young people are doing their homework, discussing the latest 
events at school while listening to music and writing social media posts. But what young 
people also have is more and more difficulties concentrating… By learning chess, children 
learn how to concentrate and fight distractions…".
While this seems like a very obvious point, it struck me that it’s not something which 
is put forward by chess professionals and promoters when talking about the game nor 
– to my knowledge – is it something that has been properly researched. Yes, it’s often 
said that chess helps concentration, but chess as a tool against distraction is something 
slightly different.
It is no secret that children are easily more distracted. Whether a child plays videogames, 
spends time on TikTok or plays chess – what’s the difference? Chess can also be a 
distraction. But, various research has shown that chess does help build skills which are 
helpful in life – such as concentration, analysis, problem solving, order, to name a few. (In 
fairness, there are studies which have also shown the benefits of video games, but not to 
the extent as chess). What if chess – as an education tool – could be used to supplement all 
those distractions into one?
This argument of chess being a tool to fight distraction can be useful, especially as 
technology – despite its many benefits – is showing to have a detrimental effect on 
children’s focus. Potentially, this may be a path to further promote chess and grant it more 
recognition in society.
Finally, when it comes to other ideas how to promote chess and change its public 
perception, we invite you to read the interview with photographer Stev Bonhage whose 
distinctive approach to life and work could bring in some new ideas on how to present the 
game to the wider world.

As if chess wasn’t already complicated 
enough, the Americans decided to suspend 
their customary pragmatism and introduced a 
convoluted format that few could understand.
The format:
 ▪Double Elimination Bracket
 ▪Classical time control: 90 minutes + 30 
seconds
 ▪Rapid time control: 15 minutes + 10 
seconds
 ▪Blitz time control: 3 minutes + 2 seconds
 ▪Championship Bracket matches: two 
classical and two rapid games, followed 
by blitz tie-break if necessary
 ▪Consolation Bracket matches: four rapid 
games, followed by blitz tie-break if 
necessary
 ▪Grand Final Reset: four rapid games 
followed by a blitz tie-break if necessary
Looking at it, the main question is: why? 
Why play a classical game followed by 
a rapid game on the same day? Why the 
championship bracket has classical games, 
followed by rapid games in case of a tie, 
but the consolation bracket has only rapid 
games? Why have only rapid games in the 
grand final?
Perhaps somebody knew the answers to these 
questions, but to this author’s knowledge 
they were never shared with the public.
One explanation that was promoted by the 
Americans, perhaps under the influence of 
the most dominant chess company in the 
world, is the idea of a second chance. In 
other words, a loss in one match shouldn’t 
send the player home – he gets another 
chance in the consolation bracket and if 
he wins his matches there, he still has a 
shot at the title, meeting the winner of the 
championship bracket in the grand finale.
This is certainly gracious, though it 
could theoretically lead to a rematch 
for first place. Imagine the winner of the 
championship losing to the winner of the 
consolation bracket: he must also get his 
second chance, leading to a rematch. I think 
Karpov, with his fondness for rematches, 
would have liked this.

THE RETURN OF LEVON ARONIAN
THE AMERICAN CUP 2024

April 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 197
After this lengthy introduction, it’s time to 
move on to the games.
The tournament saw an unexpected return 
of Levon Aronian.
After dropping out of the top 10, after 
more than a decade in it, Aronian seemed 
unlikely to come back. While always jovial, 
he hasn’t shown much ambition in the past 
period and his results were average at best.
Garry Kasparov famously said that the 
chess world is a better place with a happy 
Aronian in it, but Aronian is always happy. 
Financially secure, with a young daughter, 
he enjoys life and at the age of 41 perhaps 
nobody expects him to repeat his great feats.
Except that, like all great players, Aronian 
is ambitious. He may not always show it, 
or the opposition won’t allow him to show 
it, but there is no reason to doubt it’s there.
The winner’s luck in Aronian’s case let 
itself be known in the first round. Facing 
Sevian, after a series of draws Aronian 
took the lead by winning the first blitz 
game. In the second, the following position 
was reached.

In a must-win situation, Sevian burnt 
bridges, which often means ending up in a 
losing position. Objectively, White is lost 
here, but with little time and a lot of pieces, 
anything can happen. 
43...¥f6? From winning to losing in one 
move. It was the queen that should have 
come to that square, not the bishop!

and Black wins as he remains with two extra 
pawns after 45.£h3 £xg5 46.£xa3 h6;

43...£f6 was perhaps even simpler, though 
it doesn’t win for Black after 44.¦e2 £xf5

needed that result to win the match. 
44.¤f4! Now White is winning. It’s very 
likely that Aronian planned 
44...¤f8 And missed the very beautiful 
combination that Sevian also missed!

matter as long as White doesn’t win.

against trouble.

ARONIAN'S GRUNFELD
A lucky break is all Aronian needed.
In the next round, he faced the main 
favourite, Fabiano Caruana. These players 
know each other well, they have worked 
together, so in similar cases, the players 
usually play openings that they haven’t 
looked at together.
In this match, Aronian unleashed the 
Grunfeld Defence.
The Grunfeld is an excellent opening, 
theoretically impeccable and rich in counter-
attacking chances. White suffers greatly 
when facing it as even posing problems is 
not an easy task, forget about an advantage! 
Therefore, White’s approach to the Grunfeld 
has been to use one-game ideas, which aim 
to surprise the opponent. This is possible 
because the choice of good lines White has 
in the Grunfeld is big and the amount of 
theory in them is considerable, which puts 
tremendous pressure on the memory of the 
Black player. This hit-and-run approach for 
White, plus the whims of fashion, have led to 
a decrease in the popularity of this opening.
Aronian 
never 
played 
the 
Grunfeld 
seriously and this must have been a big 
surprise for his opponents. Combine this 
with the innovative ideas he introduced in 
the opening, and the result was a significant 
practical advantage for him.

¥g7 5.h4 was what Caruana tried in 
his second attempt against the Grunfeld. 
The advance of the h-pawn is common 
nowadays, so Aronian wasn’t too surprised. 
5...0–0 not fearing ghosts on the kingside. 
Black allows the opening of the h-file and 
the exchange of his dark-squared bishop, 
but finishes development in the meantime.

have problems and the game was drawn in 31

This 
classical 
approach, 
popular 
since Karpov’s use in the 1990 World 
Championship match against Kasparov, 
was Sevian’s choice. 
Both Robson and Caruana tried the sharpest 
7.¥c4 0–0 (7...a6!? was the most original 
of Aronian’s innovations. It worked 
wonders in his game against Robson after 
8.h4 c5 9.¤e2 h5 10.0–0 0–0 11.¥e3 ¤d7 
(Here 11...¤c6 may be an improvement, as

Aronian. (Nowadays Black’s plays nothing 
but 8...c5, yet there are other moves like 
this one, or 8...b6 (played sometimes 
before castling) or 8...£d7.) 9.0–0 ¤a5 
10.¥d3 e5!? the idea to attack White’s 
centre with ...e5 is not new in the Grunfeld, 
though rarely played here. (More common 
alternatives are 10...c5 and 10...b6.) 11.¦b1 
(11.dxe5 is the engine’s suggestion, but after 
11...¥xe5 12.f4 ¥g7 13.¥a3 ¦e8 14.£c2

A subtlety to provoke ...a6 (in view of

advantage of the weakened b6–square on 
the queenside.

allowing it would give White access to the 
weakened b6–square with ¥b6. 
14.¥d3 0–0 15.¦c4 ¦d8 The immediate 
15...¥d7 is an alternative. Generally Black 
doesn’t have problems in this endgame as 
he’s prepared for a break in the centre with 
d5, while otherwise White cannot make 
progress.

The scenario from the match with Sevian 
was repeated in the match against Caruana. 
The classical and rapid games were drawn, 
with Aronian winning both blitz games.

The match with Robson went the other 
way round. Aronian won the first two 
games and by drawing the third secured a 
win in the four-game match. The second 
win featured his surprising 7…a6 in the 
Grunfeld mentioned above.
The final against Wesley So was decided 
in the last rapid game. Aronian won it with 
Black and clinched the match 2.5-1.5.
  Wesley So - Levon Aronian 
Open Saint Louis, US (4.4), 20.03.2024
1.d4 ¤f6 2.c4 e6 In the final Aronian 
reverts to his usual openings. Perhaps he 
feared So’s preparation in the Grunfeld. 
3.¤c3 ¥b4 4.£c2 Capablanca’s favourite 
move is one of the safest against the Nimzo-
Indian. 
4...0–0 Aronian has also played 4...c5 
recently, a move that wasn’t considered as 
theoretically sound as the text move and 4...
d5, but with good preparation it’s perfectly 
possible to play it. 
5.e4 This move used to be an aggressive 
way to meet 4...0–0, but today is often a 
silent draw offer. 
5...c5!? Aronian refuses the silent draw offer! 
5...d5 is considered the main move. 
After the forcing 6.e5 ¤e4 7.¥d3 c5 
8.¤f3 cxd4 9.¤xd4 ¤d7 10.¥f4 £h4 
11.g3 £h5 the theory continues and 
draws are agreed around move 30. So 
has played this line making draws quite 
often in the past. 
6.e5 cxd4 7.a3 ¥a5!? The real surprise! 
The move hasn’t been frequently played 
by human players, but does this hold 
true when considering it is one of the 
primary moves recommended by the 
engine? So far the moves 7...¥xc3, 8...
dxc3 and 8...£a5 have been played with 
regular frequency.

According to the engine Black should be 
fine now. 
11.¥d3 is the only(!) move to keep an 
advantage. After 11...f5 12.£xc3 d5 
13.¤f3 d4 14.£b3 ¤c6 15.c5 ¢xg7 16.0–0 
e5 again White has an only (!) move to 
keep an advantage and that is 17.¥g5 £d7 
and again an only move 18.b5 ¤a5 19.£b4 
there is also 19.£b2 as an alternative here, 
at least. White should be better here, though 
to a human eye, especially one that hasn’t 
analysed this position before, it’s just a 
mess and anybody’s game. 
11...d5?! Aronian probably remembered 
that ...d5 should be played sooner rather 
than later, but here the timing isn’t right. 
11...£f6! we enter the territory of only 
moves again, this time for Black to keep the 
balance. The position is unclear after 12.¥e3 
¤c6 13.¦d1 d5 with chances for both sides. 
12.£xc3?! Now Black is fine again. 
12.¤g5! was the way to exploit Black’s 
imprecision. After 12...f5 13.£xc3 White 
threatens £h3. 13...£e7 14.¥e2 £xg7 
15.£xg7+ ¢xg7 16.¥b2+ ¢g6 17.¤f3 
White keeps the initiative in the endgame 
after 17...dxc4 18.¥xc4 e5 19.0–0 ¤c6 
20.¦ac1 as Black’s centre is rather loose. 
12...e5 Black obtains good counterplay now.

(at least in some of his games) that he 
voluntarily went for dubious lines which he 
had checked, safe in the knowledge that his 
opponents hadn’t done the same. "Nobody 
checks dubious lines" to paraphrase his 
rationale, but perhaps soon enough people 
will start.

White wants to castle as soon as possible, 
but this gives up the bishop pair and also 
has a tactical problem. 
17.¥a4 was better. After 17...b5 18.¥b3 
¥b7 White remains on top. With an extra 
pawn (the pawn on g7 doesn’t count, but 
the one on d5 does) and a safe position, he 
has very good prospects. 
17...¥xd7 18.0–0 Continuing the plan. 
18...£h4 Natural, though there was a 
stronger continuation. 
18...¥b5! 19.¦fd1 £f6 was very strong. 
The pressure on the long diagonal is 
tremendous and this limits the mobility of 
White’s pieces. Black simply wants to pick 
up the pawn on d5 with ...¦ad8xd5. 
19.g3 £h3 20.f4 ¥f6 21.£e3?! The queen 
is rarely a good blockading piece. 
21.¦ae1 ¦ad8 22.£b3 was better, when 
White has good coordination and the 
position is balanced. 
21...¥g4 Controlling the d1–square and 
keeping the bishop close to the kingside, 
though it was possible to do the same from 
the other side, from the a4–square. 
22.¦f2 ¦ad8 23.¤b3 ¦xd5 Threatening 
...¦d3. 
24.¦e1 White must keep the e4–pawn 
under control. This prevents ...¦d3. 
AFTER DROPPING OUT OF THE
TOP 10, AFTER MORE THAN A
DECADE IN IT, ARONIAN SEEMED
UNLIKELY TO COME BACK. WHILE

26.¦xe8+ ¢xg7 27.¥xf6+ ¢xf6 28.f5 is

to keep the blockade on the dark squares he 
should be fine. 
26...£d6 27.¦xd5 £xd5 28.¤d2 Ideally, 
White would like to put his knight on e3 - 
the queen is still a bad blockading piece.

Now it was possible to either exchange 
queens (suitable for the side with a 
weaker king, in this case White) or 
to put the knight on e3 with 30.£d2

32.¦c1 ¦d8 33.¤c4 ¦d3 34.¢f2 ¢xg7 
35.¤e3 and the blockade on the dark

of moves. 
31.¦c1 ¢xg7 32.¦c5 £d3 33.¦g5+ This 
is possible, but sending the rook away from

 33.¢f2 was more consistent with White’s 
blockading strategy. 
33...¢f8 34.£c5+? White got carried 
away. It may seem there is counterattack, 
but Black refutes it nicely. 
34.¢f2 was again fine for White;

In an interview after the event Levon 
said – “It’s great to play well and to 
control the flow of the game… It’s a 
really good feeling”.
Aronian won the American Cup without 
losing a single game. It is an impressive 
feat. After such a triumph, it is natural to 
ask if Aronian is capable of returning to 
the top 10. Can he muster the same flair 
that made him the fans’ favourite for many 
years? I would like to think so, though 
in light of the fierce competition from a 
surge of young talent, it would require 
an extraordinary effort by the seasoned 
veteran to reclaim his former glory.

A comet in the chess world

In the history of the 64-squared game, there have been several 
“chess comets” – people who appear out of nowhere, shine a 
light and move on, never to be seen again. Most of them were, 
of course, chess players. But not all.

The unseen heroes of chess
The chess world seldom acknowledges and even more seldomly recognises and 
remembers the people who put things together – those who help make it possible 
to play chess professionally. Namely, the organisers and the fundraisers, event 
managers, journalists who spread the word about the game and the players and, also 
– the camera crews and photographers who caught on camera some of the most 
iconic chess moments.
In the chess world in recent years several names have stood out when it comes to 
taking photos – David Llada (who is also a great friend of BCM), Leonard Ootes, Niki 
Riga, Maria Emelianova and, more recently – a phenomenon in the chess arena, Stev 
Bonhage.
Unconventional style, iconic work
Heavily tattooed, leisurely dressed and informal – Stev looks more like a street 
breakdancer or a character akin to Hunter S Thompson, with a German-Scandinavian 
twist. His unconventional style is also visible in the work he has done in the chess 
world so far and it is not always to everyone’s taste.
As the first exhibition of his chess photos is set to start touring Europe (as a part of 
FIDE’s 100th-anniversary celebration), BCM spoke to Steve Bonhage about his work 
and chess photography.
From a small place to the world stage
Stev Bonhage was born in 1985 in the former “Deutsche Demokratische Republik” - 
East Germany, but the family moved to Sweden when he was young.
“I grew up in a small place, in the middle of the forest. We had to ride 40, 50 kilometres 
to school. For me, the camera was the way out. Also, I'm an introvert. I know how to put 
the switch when I have to, but I prefer to be for myself. The camera has always been a 
way to express myself,” explains Steve.
At 17 he dropped out of school but thanks to the famous Scandinavian social support 
programmes, he fell on the safety net of a government youth employment scheme 
which landed him his first job and, as it would turn out, his life calling – in photography.
“I was working for a couple who were prominent photographers, doing ordinary stuff 
– cleaning the studio, tidying up things, setting the lights, assisting. Then something 
happened that stuck with me. I was cleaning up the digital archive and I saw these 
maps and folders neatly organised – the date, the customer/client and the location 
where the photos were taken. Oslo, Gothenburg, Malmo… These were all big places in 
Scandinavia and I thought it would be cool if people sent me to places to take photos. 
Soon, as I started to travel – all my photos were labelled this way.”

As it turned out, the camera didn’t open just a new world for Stev, but also – a new 
language.
“Whenever you have the camera in front of your face, nobody's really talking to you and 
it's more a sign communication which takes place. I got to know some amazing people 
just by sign language or gestures and stuff connected to photography. Once, I got to 
know Madonna’s yoga teacher just by taking a photo of him in Berlin”.
From breakdancing to MMA and Formula One
Stev’s first big break was in South Korea, taking photos at the R-16 festival, an annual 
international event for urban arts. A trip that was supposed to last just two weeks 
turned into a decade-long spell in Southeast Asia. From a run-down hostel in Bangkok, 
where backpackers, life chancers and enthusiasts on psychedelics played chess and 
got drunk on the rooftop, to running a hostel in Laos, Stev comes across as a real-life 
character from Alex Garland’s adventure drama, “The Beach” – travelling through life 
in search of adventure.
“Laos is another crazy story. I was just going there for a visa run and the next day, I had 
my own hostel thanks to some friends and people I got to know! We built everything 
from the ground up. I invited graffiti artists that I knew living in South East Asia. They 
were coming in and spraying the walls, and some other friends helped me build a 
volleyball court and it was really fun!”
Just as it seemed Steve was parting ways with his camera, a friend got in touch and 
invited him to take photos for a shocking story – a documentary about a secret war

April 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 209
on Laos from 1964 to 1973, during the US invasion of Vietnam, where the Americans 
dropped more than two million tons of bombs. This amounts to having one planeload 
of bombs dropped every eight minutes! To this day, Laos remains the most heavily 
bombed country in the world.
“The documentary was about the people living in these areas – who use remains of 
the bombs to make jewellery or cutlery, and then end up harming themselves or even 
losing their lives. You have kids playing in the fields full of these bombs, it’s crazy…”.
Steve’s curiosity took him from the bombed fields of Laos to MMA championships in 
Asia, to taking photos for Red Bull (his most successful partnership), Formula One, 
Heineken, Puma, Ferrari…
All of these opportunities came just by word of mouth and friendships!
“I don't have any business cards or anything - I write to people. I tell them that I would 
like to get access to take some photos. I will share the content with them. I would 
pay for my own flight. I would pay for my own accommodation. And, if you like the 
photos then we can start to discuss if you want to work with me or not. Also, I’m not 
an extrovert, so the camera is a way for me to communicate”.
The cooperation with Red Bull was particularly fruitful for Stev.
“I did a lot of work for them and for their Formula One team and driver Max Verstappen. 
They work 24/7 and think out of the box. They are very open to ideas and want to go 
one step further. For example, in their Formula One hangar, they organised a ‘world

210
competition in throwing paper aeroplanes’. It was fun and turned out to be very popular 
with the crowd and great for their brand”.
“Chess could also benefit from thinking more like that,” argues Steve.
But Stev isn’t someone from the chess world and his views are seen as too radical by 
some.
“I learnt chess when I was six or seven but never played it consistently. I enjoy playing the 
game and it’s fun. Also, I am interested in philosophy and history, so the political backdrop 
to chess has been very interesting to me. So, I started taking chess-related photos.”
Photographing the champions
Usually, chess photographers are former players/organisers or people who have in 
one way or another had a longer-term connection to the game. This often means they 
know the chess players and the players know them. This was not the case for Steve 
whose first official chess event was the 2022 Candidates in Madrid. He was hired by 
David Llada, an accomplished photographer himself, who was at the time FIDE’s Chief 
Marketing Officer.
“In the photos, I take of chess players and chess events – I try to be more unconventional. 
After all, rules are there to be broken”, explains Steve.
“There are documentaries about why a certain tone makes you feel a certain way. It’s 
similar to photos/videos – if you have a dark picture, you will automatically always go 
to the brightest spot. That's how I direct you where I want you to look. It’s a concept I 
took from film. And then, you can explore the picture for yourself.
As with all good things in life – it’s in the detail. It’s the love for detail that got me so 
deep into exploring why a good picture is a good picture and why certain things are 
wrong or right,” Stev argues.
“As a photographer covering a chess event, you find yourself in a position that 95 per 
cent of the people don’t find themselves in – you are face-to-face with the players. 
You’re among them, you see things that are not shown in the broadcast and that are 
not noticeable unless you are there – from the background scenery and feel of the 
venue to the body language and behaviour of players away from the board.”
Speaking about his experience of taking photos of Magnus Carlsen, Stev compares it 
to the experience he had of taking photos of other famous sports people, such as the 
Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel or the tennis player Roger Federer.
“They just want to be treated normally. So, when I want to take a special photo of 
Magnus or do a quick shoot, I don’t beat around the bush, but just put it straight to 
him – level with him, and say ‘Let's just do it’. And I found it that people of that stature 
prefer the straight talk and doing things quickly”.

Telling a joke or acting funny also helps in getting a great photo, Steve notes. “Creating 
energy through smiling and laughing and making a fool out of yourself like I did with 
the kids in the refugee camp in Kenya where FIDE is doing work to support them. 
Because I used to do a lot of acrobatics and breakdancing, I pull that off with the kids 
and they enjoy it. Why do this? It relaxes people and then when they slowly start to 
forget me and why I am here. Then - I start taking photos”.
Since Madrid in 2022, Stev has photographed many chess events, including the World 
Championship Match between Nepo and Ding, but has also covered FIDE’s social 
initiatives, such as Chess for Freedom, where he visited convicts in prisons who play 
chess, and the Chess for Protection project in Kenya.
"Capture" - a new perspective on chess
Just this year, Stev published a book – “CAPTURE – AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN 
PHOTOGRAPHY AND CHESS”, where he exhibited some of his best works related to 
chess. Now, he has turned the book into an exhibition due to travel to several countries, 
starting from Switzerland in April.
“The exhibition is not primarily for chess players because they already know my work. 
I just want people to just have a walk and get into it, and to get into their head without 
them even knowing we’ve done that. Overall, I want to change the way people look at 
chess. Also, I want to change the way chess photography works”.
“I think a lot of people are not interested in chess, because they have nothing to relate 
to. They don't play the game, and we don't know the person and their lifestyle, and, and 
world opinions might not be with us. The perception of chess needs to change,” Stev 
says, pointing to Formula One as a good example.
“Look at the development of Formula One. It has always been like it is today in terms 
of the sport – but the audience today is completely different than in the 1990s or 
even before. Why – because they made it more accessible and explained it in a way 
that everyone can relate to it. They’ve dumbed it down. And now you have the Netflix 
show Drive to Survive and there you have a storyline – the historical rivalries, the 
competition, the drama. I think chess needs that”.
He points to Ian Nepomniachtchi as a potential hero of that story. “You have this guy 
who is desperately trying to become World Champion. He comes close and then in the 
most critical moments he fails, but he is not giving up. You have the rivalry between 
him and Carlsen, you have the story there”.
There is another aspect to explore, he notes: female chess versus male chess.
“If you reach people with something they can relate to, it becomes more personal. I 
think these broad narratives, combined with more dynamic time controls, could truly 
change the perspective of chess”.

The Prague Masters (27 February – 7 
March) was the last tournament before 
the Candidates for the Indian trio. As I 
mentioned in the preview published in 
the March issue, the youth has infinite 
energy and playing non-stop comes 
naturally for them.
Apart 
from 
the 
Indians 
(Gukesh, 
Praggnanadhaa and Vidit), the organisers 
assembled an exciting field featuring two 
more prodigies, Keymer and Abdusattorov, 
local representatives Navara and Nguyen 
and 
creative 
players 
like 
Rapport, 
Maghsoodloo and Bartel.
The mix proved a successful one. The 
tournament abounded in exciting games 
and decisive results.
In a tight field like in Prague, it’s hard 
to expect somebody to dominate, but 
that is exactly what happened. Nodirbek 
Abdusattorov scored an incredible 6.5/9, 
winning five games, losing one and 
finishing full point and a half ahead of the 
field. He even secured tournament victory 
with a round to spare, not a common sight 
in short nine-round tournaments.
This victory, with the 15 rating points 
gained thanks to it, propelled the 19-year-
old Uzbek to number four in the world.
Abdusattorov played powerful chess in 
Prague. He started with a technical win 
over Nguyen in round one, but he needed 
a good deal of winner’s luck in round three.

28...¦xf7?? Oftentimes it is a single move 
that separates winning from losing. Navara 
makes the losing one. 
28...¥h7! was winning for Black. White’s 
knight on g5 and the bishop on f7 are 
hanging, but so is the pawn on f2. 29.£h5 
(29.¤xh7 ¦xf7 and the knight won’t make it 
out of h7 alive; 29.¤e6 £xf7 30.¤xf8 ¦xf8 
is winning for Black, the two bishops will 
easily deal with the white rook.) 29...¥xf2! 
Not touching anything on the kingside and 
letting White’s pieces to hang there for a 
while. 30.¦f1 ¥e3 Now the knight has to 
move. 31.¤e6 ¦xf7! and in view of the 
threat of a back-rank mate, Black emerges 
with an extra piece after 32.¦e1 ¦g8.
29.¦d6! Black would be winning, if it had 
not been for this refutation. The undefended 
rook attacks both the rook on d8 and the 
bishop on d4. It’s likely this move that 
Navara missed. 
29...¦c8 29...¦ff8 30.¦xd8 ¦xd8 31.£e8+ 
¦xe8 32.¦xe8# is a back-rank mate;
29...¦xd6 30.£e8+ is another version of 
the back-rank mate. 
30.¤xf7+ £xf7 31.¦xd4 White won 
the exchange and has an easily winning 
position. 
31...b3 32.b6 ¦c2 33.£f3 b2 34.b7 £f8 
35.¦dd1 ¦c5 36.£b3
1–0
 
It is pretty certain that had Navara found 
the win Abdusattorov would not have 
continued in the confident and impressive 
style. A lucky win always gives the player 
that extra boost of confidence, thanks to the 
knowledge that luck is on his side.
After a draw against Gukesh in the next 
round, Abdusattorov played, in his own 
words, a “very, very clean game” against 
Bartel.

1.e4 c5 2.¤f3 ¤c6 3.¤c3 g6 Without 
the possibility of a Maroczy bind after 
c4, Black happily invites his opponent to 
discuss the sharp lines of the Dragon. 
4.d4 cxd4 5.¤xd4 ¥g7 6.¥e3 ¤f6 7.¥c4 
This is White’s most principled move, but 
soon enough he admits that he isn’t ready 
for a fully-fledged Dragon fight. 
7...0–0 8.¥b3 d6 9.h3 Here it is. If White 
is to achieve anything he must castle long 
in the Dragon. This can be done starting 
with the move 9.f3, leading to the Yugoslav 
Attack. With this timid move White gives up 
any hope of achieving something out of the 
opening. The only advantage of the move is 
that it takes the game to calmer waters. 
9...¥d7 
Abdusattorov 
will 
employ 
Kasparov’s plan, but only a move later and 
with a bishop on d7 rather than on b7. 
9...¤a5 10.0–0 b6 has been known to be 
very good for Black since the game Anand-
Kasparov from Linares 2003. After 11.¦e1 
¥b7 12.¥g5 ¤xb3 13.axb3 h6 14.¥h4 £d7 
15.£d2 ¤h5 16.f3 e5 17.¤de2 f5 it was Black 
who took over the initiative, though eventually 
the game was drawn. ½–½ (32) Anand,V 
(2753)-Kasparov,G (2847) Linares 2003.
10.0–0 ¤a5 11.£d3 a6 12.¦fe1 ¦c8 
Black’s play is simple on the queenside: 
play ...b5, ...¤c4 or ...¤xb3, use the c-file 
to create activity. White, on the other hand, 
has only one constructive idea and that is 
the ¤d5 jump. 
13.¦ad1 b5 14.¥g5 White prepares the 
¤d5 jump by placing the bishop on g5 
because he anticipates an exchange on d5, 
which after exd5, will see the bishop on g5 
and the rook on e1 attack the pawn on e7. 
With the same anticipation in mind, Black 
plays his next move.

04/144

14...¦e8 Abdusattorov was quite content 
with this prophylactic move, defending the 
pawn on e7 in advance. 
15.¤d5 White is fully mobilised, so he 
executes his main idea, but Black is well 
prepared to meet it. 
15...¤xd5 16.exd5 ¤c4 Black obtains the 
bishop pair now as the knight on c4 cannot 
be tolerated. 
17.¥xc4 bxc4 Gaining tempo for attack on 
the queenside. 
 17...¦xc4 was a possible alternative. After 
18.¥e3 (18.c3 ¥xd4!? 19.cxd4 f6 wrecks 
White’s pawns, though the position is still 
unclear, with the opposite-coloured bishops 
still on the board.) 18...£c7 19.c3 £b7 
with chances for both sides - White is solid 
in the centre and Black has no problems.

White eyes the h6–square for ¥h6, but 
Black is faster on the queenside. 
18.£e4! was more precise, as it prevents 
Black’s counterplay. The idea is that after 
18...£a5 White has 19.¥d2! and the pawn 
on a2 is taboo in view of 19...£xa2?? 
20.¥c3 and the queen is trapped and lost 
after ¦a1 next. 
18...£a5 Now the threat of ...£xa2 is real. 
19.£e4? Wasting time like this is too much. 
19.£c1! was best. The idea is to remove 
the queen from the e-file (so there is no 
pin there when White takes on e7) and 
defend the b2–pawn at the same time. 
19...¦c5 is likely best. (19...£xd5?! 
20.¤e6! puts Black in danger, who now 
should sacrifice the queen, as 20...£a5? 
21.¤xg7 ¢xg7 22.¥xe7 leaves him 
fatally exposed on the dark-squares; 
19...£xa2 20.¥xe7 is fine for White.) 
20.¦xe7 ¦xe7 21.¥xe7 ¦xd5 22.¤f3 
when White should be able to hold the 
balance; 
Abdusattorov 
thought 
that 
19.¥xe7?! ¥e5! is what his opponent 
missed. Indeed, Black is much better here 
after 20.f4 ¦xe7 21.fxe5 ¦xe5.
19...£xa2 This is what the queen came for. 
20.£h4? Third dubious move in a row, this 
time giving Black a decisive advantage. 
20.¥xe7 £xb2 21.£f4 was the most 
resilient. 21...¥a4! 22.¤c6! ¥xc6 23.dxc6 
¦xc6 24.¥xd6 and even though he’s a 
pawn down, White should have enough 
activity to hold the balance. 
20...£xb2 Black keeps on taking pawns 
and White has nothing to show for it.

Please take a moment to compare this 
position to the one arising after White’s 
24.¥xd6 in the comment to White’s 20th 
move. There is only one difference - in this 
position the black pawn is on h6, while 
there it is on h7. Here Black is winning 
(no problems with the back rank) while 
there White should draw. Chess is indeed a 
tragedy of a single tempo!

After this win, Abdusattorov played three 
more decisive games in a row! First, he 
lost to Praggnanandhaa in a game that 
had its ups and downs, with Abdusattorov 
blundering at the end (see below). He 
bounced back immediately with a win over 
Keymer with the black pieces in a game 
where he went after his opponent’s king 
in the centre – not something one would 
expect in the Queen’s Gambit Accepted, 
but modern chess can make the most solid 
openings full of fireworks.
Still, that was nothing compared to his game 
with Maghsoodloo in the penultimate round.

Just 
after 
the 
time-control 
White 
sacrificed his queen for a strong passed 
pawn, rook and bishop. This puts Black 
under severe pressure as White’s position 
is easy to play - he just seeks ways to 
promote that pawn. 
41...¤e6 The knight must control the 
c7–square. 
42.¥c4 ¤c7 43.¤f1 The knight on c7 
is a good blockading piece, but it can 
be exchanged, which is what White sets 
out to do: ¤e3–d5 will exchange the 
blockader. 
43...£e8 
Black 
disrupts 
White’s 
coordination by attacking the pawn on c6 
and forcing the bishop to occupy the d5 or 
b5 square. 
44.¥d5 White prefers the keep the pawn 
control of the d5–square and allow a break 
with ...b5. 
44.¥b5 allows a break from the other side 
with 44...d5! 45.exd5 ¤xd5 46.¦c1 ¤c7 
and without a pawn support White can no 
longer use the d5–square to exchange the 
blockading knight. 
44...b5 45.¤e3?! Ambitious play, but 
crossing the line a bit.

square that allows White a small trick two

61...¢f8! was the correct move. The king 
cannot approach the pawn on c7, but this 
means that the knight and bishop must stay 
on d5 and the a4–e8 diagonal respectively to 
keep it at bay, thus limiting their mobility. 
White cannot make progress now. 62.¢c4

62...¢g7 62...£c8 63.¥d7! is the trick

Truly an appropriate game to wrap up a 
tournament. This win gave Abdusattorov 
the tournament victory with a round to 
spare. He drew with Rapport in the last 
round and kept his point-and-a-half gap.
Even though he didn’t qualify for the Candidates 
(he wasn’t really close) this victory and the 
break into the top 5 cements Abdusattorov’s 
status as one of the main players who will fight 
for the title in the next cycle.
THE INDIANS
The Indian players had their minds set on 
the Candidates and playing with one’s mind 
set on another tournament never bodes well 
for the tournament at hand. This happened 
to all three of them, though with different 
outcomes and to different extent.
Praggnanadhaa had a run of 47 classical 
games without a loss before coming to 
Prague. In Prague, he lost two.
Those two losses were in a row. After 
starting 
with 
a 
win 
over 
Keymer, 
Praggnanandhaa lost to Maghsoodloo and 
Rapport. The second loss was particularly 
painful as it was from a winning position.

26.¦xh7 White’s attack is irresistible. The 
threats are ¦h8 or ¦dh1. Rapport gives 
up a piece. 
26...e5 27.¦h8+ ¢xg7 28.¦xe8 £f4 And 
hopes that in the endgame the two connected 
passed pawns will give him counterchances. 
29.¦h1? Choosing from the several winning 
continuations Praggnanandhaa chooses a non-
winning one! This tells us one thing - if a 
superb calculator like Praggnanandhaa couldn’t 
calculate a clear win, then the win wasn’t trivial. 
29.£xf4 exf4 30.¦dd8 is the most forcing 
way. 30...¥b7 (30...g2 31.¦g8+ ¢f6 
32.¤e4+ ¢e5 33.¦xg2 is pretty simple, 
winning one of the pawns.) 31.¦g8+ ¢f6

¥xa8 35.¦xa8 and White manages to control 
both pawns as 35...g2 36.¦g8 f3 37.¢d2 ¢f4 
38.¤f2 stops both pawns; 
29.¥e4! was probably the most "automatic" 
way to win. White centralises the bishop and 
controls both pawns. This move didn’t really 
need any calculation so it was the safest bet. It 
seems that Praggnanandhaa wanted to calculate 
the win until the end and miscalculated, an 
impractical decision when he had this simple 
move at his disposal. 
29...£xd2+ 30.¢xd2 ¦f2+ 31.¢e3 ¦xc2

To his credit, Praggnanandhaa pulled

defeating his compatriot Vidit and the 
leader Abdusattorov.

The game had ups and downs and the 
position here is approximately balanced. 
Abdusattorov misses a tactic with his 
next move. 
36.¦e2?? White defends the pawn on b2, 
but loses more material now! 
36.¥e2! with the idea of ¥c4 was very 
good. After 36...£xb2 37.¥c4 £xf2+ 
38.¢xf2 White will regain the pawn with 
an equal position;
36.¥h5 would have repeated the position 
as this was the position on the board 
two moves earlier, when Black played 
34...£d5. Possibly White was worried 
about 36...¥xb2 but White has 37.¤xf7! 
and after the forcing 37...£xf7 38.£xb2 
£f5 39.£a2+! a precise check to be able 
to take on g6 with check, too. 39...¢h7 
(39...¢h8 40.£a5! attacks the rook on d8. 
40...¦d2 41.¥f3 and White managed to 
bring the bishop back to the defence of the 
kingside.) 40.¥xg6+ £xg6 41.£b1 White 
manages to exchange queens and even 
though his kingside is weak on the light 
squares, White should draw this after 41...
b3!? 42.£xb3 £c6 43.£c2+ ¢h8 44.£f2.
36...¦xd6! The problem is that the rook 
on e2 blocks the bishop’s control of the 
d1–square. 
37.¦e8+ Perhaps White was hoping 
on this zwischenschach, but Black had 
seen deeper. 
37.¥xd6 £d1+ is elementary. 
37...¢h7 38.¥xd6 ¥d4! This is the 
refutation of White’s defence. 
39.£xd4 £xf3 40.£f2 £d1+ Black 
eliminated the bishop that covered the 
d1–square and returns there to pick up the 
bishop on d6.

with White’s lone rook.

He should have also won a third one, 
but misplayed his winning advantage 
against Gukesh.
Eventually the tournament was a decent 
one for Praggnanandhaa, sharing second 
place with Nguyen and Maghsoodloo 
with 5/9. In retrospect, he is probably 
glad he lost those games in Prague and 
not in Toronto. Still, his play was not as 
stable as we got used to, something that 
won’t be the case in Toronto.
Gukesh was similarly wobbly.
He started with a win with the black 
pieces against Nguyen, but then he also 
lost two games in a row, both of them 
with the white pieces to Navara and 
Bartel. The problem for Gukesh was 
that in both games he had an advantage, 
with Navara even a winning one, but he 
didn’t play well.
Even more so, Gukesh should have lost a 
third game in a row, but managed to save 
a lost endgame against Praggnanandhaa, 
thus stopping the bleeding. In the next 
round he beat Keymer convincingly, 
coming back to 50%.
His unstable play continued in the 
last round, when he was outplayed by 
Maghsoodloo and should have lost again.

Not a tournament to be proud of for 
Gukesh, but like Praggnanandhaa, he is 
likely happy the blunders and the losses 
came before Toronto. These shocks will 
compose him and at the Candidates 
we will likely see a focused and sharp 
Gukesh as in his best tournaments.
Worst of all the three Indians was Vidit. 
He ended up last, with three losses and 
no wins. Starting with four solid draws 
he suddenly lost three games in a row, 
a feat both his compatriots managed to 
avoid by the skin of their teeth. 
The heartbreak happened in round six. 
After outplaying Keymer, Vidit obtained a 
winning position.

is exactly what happened.

Instead of reaching 50% with a win, Vidit sank 
to -2 and in the next round lost to Maghsoodloo 
for a third loss in a row. Ironically, in that game, 
while having an advantage, he again allowed 
his queen to be trapped!
Vidit finished last, which cannot be 
encouraging before the greatest test in 
Toronto. Doubts will creep in, but he’s 
capable of rising to the challenge.
Prague Masters was all about the new 
generation. It is a state of affairs we all 
must get used to.

Two of the greatest Jewish intellectuals, 
Lasker (1868-1941) and Einstein (1879-
1955) were contemporaries and friends. 
Emanuel Lasker, son of a Jewish cantor, 
and world chess champion from 1894 to 
1921, shared many concerns with that 
genius of Relativity, Albert Einstein.  
Not least was his preoccupation with the 
future of European Jews. Towards the 
end of his career, Lasker published The 
Community of the Future. This was a 
political tract, in which he demonstrated 
many of his ideas to create an ideal society. 
Two problems were especially prominent in 
his lucubrations: the fate of European Jews, 
highlighted of course by the irresistible rise 
of the Nazis in Germany, and the spectre of 
widespread unemployment.
To resolve the first problem, Lasker even 
proposed the near geographical homonym, 
Alaska, as a possible refuge for Jewish 
immigration, a proposal that at that time 
of intractable emergency did not sound as 
outlandish as it might today. Lasker also 
pondered deeply on the origins of anti-
Semitism and identified unemployment as a 
major cause of resentment against the Jews. 
His remedy to cure the evil of unemployment 
was to establish communities modelled on 
the Kibbutz system, then popular in Israel, 
in order to prepare and train people for 
the job market. Lasker comprehended that 
work did set free and empower populations, 
a stance in complete opposition to the 
Satanic Nazi parody, erected over the gates 
of Dachau, Theresienstadt and Auschwitz: 
Arbeit macht frei.  
While winning and holding the World 
Chess Championship for 27 years, Lasker 
had earned a PhD in Mathematics, with 
his 100-page 1905 thesis Zur Theorie der 
Moduln und Ideale. This work is regarded 
as one of the foundations of modern algebra. 
A confirmed polymath, he published 
several philosophical works, wrote one 
verse drama and regularly commented 
upon political events. In his prime Lasker 
was one of the most dominant champions, 
only losing the title to Capablanca in 1921. 
In addition, he was a first-class contract 
bridge player, writing about this and other 
games, including Draughts, Go and his own 
invention, the equally homonymic Lasca.
At the age of eleven Lasker was sent to 
Berlin to study mathematics, where he 
lived with his brother Berthold, eight 
years his senior, who, around 1879, the 
year of Einstein’s birth, taught him how 
to play chess. To supplement their income 
Emanuel Lasker played chess and card 
games for modest stakes, principally at the 
Cafe Kaiserhof. His rise was rapid and by 
1893 Lasker was beginning to look like a 
convincing aspirant to world honours.
The incumbent champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, 
had already twice despatched the Russian 
Titan, Mikhail Tchigorin, and with the next 
natural challenger, Dr Siegbert Tarrasch, 
puzzlingly reluctant to enter the lists, 
Lasker travelled to the new world, where 
his challenge to Steinitz was played out in 
1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, 
and Montreal. Steinitz had previously 
announced that he would win easily against 
his relatively inexperienced opponent, so 
it came as a something of a shock to the 
chess world, when it was Lasker who won 
the first game. Thus, on the transatlantic 
field of honour, two German-speaking Jews 
battled it out for the supreme chess title, 
while a third, Tarrasch, watched helplessly 
from the sidelines, as his dream of chess 
imperium vanished before his eyes.
Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, 
five losses and four draws, thus becoming 
the second universally recognised World 
Chess Champion, and confirmed his title 
by beating Steinitz even more convincingly 
in their re-match in 1896-1897 (ten wins, 
five draws, and a mere two losses).
Einstein was, of course, a serious candidate 
for the supreme genius of all time. Yet, like 
Lasker, he was deeply concerned by the 
plight of European Jewry, and at one point, as 
we shall see, he even declined the presidency

of the newly formed state of Israel. In just 
a few years, his brilliant insights entirely 
changed the way the universe is perceived, 
while his mighty equation, E=MC2, was 
to make available both for creative and 
destructive purposes, an energy source of 
hitherto unimagined intensity — atomic 
power. Indeed, Einstein’s investigations 
ushered in the atomic age. For the very first 
time, human beings were actually placed 
in the position of understanding how the 
universe works, while simultaneously being 
given the terrifying capacity to annihilate 
their own world.
Einstein has the reputation of having been 
a relative dunce at his school in Munich, 
but this is a misapprehension. Although 
precocious, he did not excel in those 
subjects taught by the Luitpold Gymnasium, 
where he was a pupil. Einstein was later to 
denounce their lessons as “lies”, and he 
was in fact expelled from the school on the 
grounds that he was a “disruptive influence” 
on his fellow students. He had an enquiring 
mind and often used to daydream. When he 
applied himself to something that he really 
enjoyed doing, he would excel.
Two games of chess won by Einstein do 
survive. My heart likes to believe that 
these are as genuine, like well attested 
games by Tolstoy, Randolph Churchill and 
Prokofiev, though my head warns that they 
might belong in the apocryphal category, 
inhabited by games attributed to Napoleon 
and Pope John Paul II.
Einstein studied music as a boy and 
eventually 
became 
an 
accomplished 
violinist, playing for relaxation. While 
playing a duet with a professional violinist, 
Einstein missed a few notes and beats. This 
prompted his exasperated companion to 
ask “What’s the matter with you, Einstein? 
Can’t you count?”
It is clear, though, that early in his life 
(he was fascinated by a compass at the 
age of five), Einstein was determined to 
probe the secrets and solve the riddle of 
the physical world. He was inspired by a 
book of Euclid’s geometry and he made a 
particular point of studying Michelangelo’s 
pictures. By the age of 16, Einstein had 
already written a scientific paper on the 
relationship between electricity, magnetism 
and the ether. He reported at the time that he 
came up with his theories by encouraging 
himself to play mind games, in which he 
allowed his imagination to run riot.
Einstein 
also 
reported 
that 
in 
one 
daydreaming session, he had imagined 
riding on a sunbeam to the end of the 
universe. To his amazement, when he got to 
“the end of the universe”, he found he was 
back where he had started his “journey”, 
and thus concluded that the universe must be 
both finite and curved. In his paper, Einstein 
explored the question “what would happen 
if one could follow a beam of light at the 
speed of light?” As a result, he discovered 
a paradox which, in scientific jargon, is “a 
spatially oscillating electromagnetic field at 
rest”. In other words, in spite of moving at 
a vast speed, one would appear to have not 
moved at all.
In 1895, Einstein joined the Swiss Federal 
Polytechnic School at Zurich, at an age two 
years below the standard age of enrolment. 
There Einstein studied under Professor 
Hermann Minkowski, the Russo-German 
mathematician, whose special interests 
were the theory of numbers, space and time. 
Einstein could not have found a teacher 
more in tune with his own predilections. 
Einstein took Swiss nationality in 1901, and 
in 1902 he was appointed Examiner at the 
Swiss Patent Office. From this point on, his 
achievements begin to take on the aspect of 
an intellectual roller coaster.
Einstein published a steady stream of 
scientific papers on a number of problems 
in the field of physics. One concerned the 
quantum theory of Germany’s greatest 
physicist, Max Planck (1858-1947), which 
held that energy changes or emissions occur 
in violent, abrupt instalments, packages or 
quanta. Planck himself was to become a

04/144
   | BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE
228
Nobel Prize winner, President of the Berlin 
Science Academy and a member of the 
Royal Society.  
In 1905, Einstein applied Planck’s quantum 
theory to light and published his revolutionary 
paper on Special Relativity. From 1909 
onwards, the scientific world realised that 
a new Galileo or Newton was upon them, 
and showered  Einstein with Professorships 
– for example, in  Zurich, Prague and Berlin. 
In 1916, Einstein published his theory of 
General Relativity. Three years later, two 
British expeditions confirmed, through 
their observation of eclipses, that Einstein’s 
theories were correct.
The world of science was now in ferment, 
but excitement also gripped the world at 
large. As the Times of  London wrote: “The 
scientific conception of the fabric of the 
universe must be changed. It is confidently 
believed by the greatest experts that enough 
has been done to overthrow the certainty of 
ages, and to require a new philosophy of 
the universe. A philosophy that will sweep 
away nearly all that has hitherto been 
accepted as the axiomatic basis of physical 
thought. The ideals of Aristotle and Euclid 
and Newton, which are the basis of all our 
present conceptions, prove in fact not to 
correspond with what can be observed in 
the fabric of the universe. Space is merely 
a relation between two sets of data and an 
infinite number of times may coexist. Here 
and there, past and present, are relative 
not absolute and change according to 
the ordinates and coordinates selected. 
Observational science has in fact led back 
to the purest subjective idealism.”
Lasker disagreed with Einstein’s theories and 
wrote forcefully in opposition to them. This, 
however, did not deter the great physicist 
from contributing a magnificently insightful 
foreword to Dr J Hannak’s standard 
biography of the great chess master. Einstein 
wrote: “Emanuel Lasker was undoubtedly 
one of the most interesting people I came 
to know in my later life. Few indeed can 
have combined such a unique independence 
of personality with so eager an interest in 
all the great problems of mankind.” One of 
these, of course, was Einstein’s Theory of 
Relativity, which Lasker hated.
Einstein again: “Lasker’s keen analytical 
brain 
had 
immediately 
and 
clearly 
recognised that the entire problem hinged 
on the constancy of the velocity of light in 
empty space. He clearly saw that, once such 
constancy was admitted, the relativisation 
of space was unanswerable, whether one 
liked it or not, and he did not like it at all… 
I rather liked Lasker’s stubborn intellectual 
independence, a most rare quality in a 
generation whose intellectuals are almost 
invariably mere camp followers. And so 
I let the matter rest.” “Stubborn” here is 
Einsteinspeak for “wrong”. Nevertheless, 
one wonders how Einstein and Lasker 
would have fared within the groupthink 
corral of our modern woking classes.
Hitler’s rise to power in the 1930s, and 
the particularly pernicious version of 
Nazi-inspired groupthink which infected 
Germany in the 1930s, led to Einstein 
leaving Europe and establishing himself 
at Princeton in the United States, where he 
lived for 20 years. In September 1939 he 
wrote to President Roosevelt, advising him 
to start work on an atomic bomb project 
and warning of the dangers of a possible 
German initiative in this field. This was 
to lead directly to the Manhattan Project, 
so brilliantly depicted in the recent Oscar 
dominating film Oppenheimer. 
The equation, E=MC2, where energy 
equals mass multiplied by the speed of 
light, squared, demonstrates that a very 
small amount of mass is the equivalent of 
a vast amount of energy. By utilising this 
theory, two German scientists, Otto Hahn 
and Fritz Strassman, were already engaged 
in 1938 in splitting the uranium  atom. 
They were thus on the brink of unleashing 
untold energy for Germany. Fortunately, 
though, Werner Heisenberg, Germany’s 
top physicist during the 1940s, succeeded 
in leading the Nazi authorities down a

blind alley, as befits the originator of the 
Uncertainty Principle, and thus helped to 
deflect Nazi science from concentrating on 
the creation of an atomic weapon.
After the detonation of atomic bombs 
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the 
subsequent cessation of global hostilities, 
Einstein, who had earlier written an anti-
war book with Sigmund Freud (Why War?, 
1933), urged international control of all 
atomic devices. Then, in common with 
Charlie Chaplin, Einstein also protested 
against the communist witch-hunt of 
Senator Joseph McCarthy’s Un-American 
Activities Committee. In 1952, Einstein 
was offered the presidency of the newly 
created state of  Israel, but declined to 
accept the honour, saying: “Equations are 
more important to me, because politics are 
for the present, but an equation is something 
for eternity!”
Examination of Einstein’s brain after his 
death revealed that it contained 400 per 
cent more glial cells per neurone than 
usual, which would have had the effect of 
boosting his power of association between 
seemingly  disparate items way beyond the 
average. But whether this was the cause or 
effect of his genius, it is impossible to tell.
Einstein’s great predecessor, Sir Isaac 
Newton, wrote of his three inspirational 
friends, 
Amicus 
Platonis, 
Amicus 
Aristoteles and Amicus Veritas. Plato and 
Aristotle knew nothing of chess, but in my 
heart of hearts I yearn to believe that those 
two quasi-apocryphal Einstein games are, 
indeed, a true indication of the chess ability 
of possibly the greatest genius humankind 
has ever known.
Now for my own experiences with physics, 
somewhat less illustrious, I fear, than those 
of Lasker and Einstein. During my thirteen 
years at Dulwich College and Trinity 
College Cambridge (1959-1972) I observed 
a curious phenomenon. According to the 
eminent British scientist and novelist C. 
Emanuel Lasker;

P. Snow, in his Rede lecture of 1959, a 
major problem had gradually arisen in the 
intellectual life of Western society. Snow 
described it as a split into “two cultures” 
with science on the one hand and the 
humanities on the other. He lamented this 
development as being a major handicap to 
solving the world’s most pressing problems.
As a pupil at Dulwich, I sympathised with 
his argument. Already struggling with 
maths, I never did manage to work out 
what logarithmic tables were and why they 
were useful. Accordingly, I arrived at my 
first physics lesson, armed with a certain 
degree of scepticism. Once the class was 
seated, a gushingly enthusiastic physics 
master proceeded to explain why the 
human eye and the camera worked in the 
same way. His fervour failed to make the 
leap between his mind and mine. Descartes 
may have said that the human body is a 
machine, but I instinctively rebelled against 
this proposition, reasoning as follows: that 
consciousness 
(definitely), 
intelligence 
(sometimes) and quite possibly even a soul, 
animated human vision, while a camera 
functioned purely mechanically, and then 
only according to its operator’s instructions.
Sensing that I was never going to excel at 
physics, I decided to devote any time that 
might have gone to physics, to studying and 
playing chess.
Whereas my preferred field of academic 
endeavour focused on Latin, French, 
German and English literature, most of 
my contemporary young chess hopefuls 
were mathematicians. Indeed, the head of 
the mathematics department at Dulwich 
College personally tried to persuade me 
to specialise in maths. Little did he know. 
He had only looked at my chess results 
and drawn what he thought was the 
appropriate conclusion. Had he examined 
my maths papers he might have spared 
himself the effort.
Allegedly the Napoleonic-era Prussian 
military theoretician Carl Philipp Gottfried 
von Clausewitz once remarked that cash is 
to the economy, as war is to international 
politics and diplomacy, in other words, 
crunch time.
Adopting the politics to war analogy, 
whether apocryphal or not, exams are an 
unfortunate fact of life. They are balanced 
on the opposite side of the equation 
attributed to Clausewitz by how much 
attention you were paying in class. In my 
case, none, so I was fully prepared to score 
zero in ‘O’ Level Physics, the Cretaceous 
Period equivalent of modern GCSE’s. 
Come the exam, I sat down at my desk, 
wrote my name at the top of the paper, 
waited for the obligatory thirty minutes to 
expire and then walked out, the exam page 
unblemished by even the most microscopic 
intervention from my part.
But then came the physics practical where, 
to my horror, I discovered that the rules 
were different. No one was permitted 
to leave before the full three hours had 
elapsed. Which Torquemada of the ‘O’ 
Level inquisitory board, I asked myself, 
had devised that particular torture?
There was nothing for it, but to try to 
answer the question, and here there dawned 
a faint glimmer of hope. The invigilator 
handed out Vernier Calipers to measure 
the distance which formed the substance 
of the question. If there was one thing 
I accidentally remembered from the 
generally abortive physics lessons I had 
been forced to attend over the previous 3 
years, it was that Vernier Calipers measured 
microdistances.
So, I set to work and sought to fill the 
three tedious hours by actually answering 
the question. After two hours and fifty-
nine minutes had elapsed, I came up with 
the answer of 120 meters. This seemed 
instinctively to be wrong. Summoning 
my chess skills, which regularly required 
thinking quickly in a crisis, and when short 
of time, I hastily inserted a decimal point, 
shifting it as far to the left of 120 meters as

April 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 231
seemed consistent with a micro distance. I 
then submitted my answer.
Needless to say, it was not correct. Combined 
with contributing a blank sheet of paper 
(apart from my name at the top, of course) 
for the theory exam, my expectations of a 
high grade after the catastrophic viva were, 
to put it mildly, on the low side of zero. 
Imagine, however, my indignation when the 
overall result came out as “ungraded”! This 
struck me as monstrously unfair. According 
to The Inquisition’s own rules, grade one 
was top (budding physics genius) while 
grade nine was bottom (confirmed physics 
sub moron). There was no “ungraded.” That 
level of disastrous non achievement simply 
did not exist at the time.
Less determined spirits might have given up 
at this point, but fired by an unquenchable 
hunger and thirst for academic justice, 
I submitted a formal complaint to 
Torquemada’s office and demanded the 
just desserts of my well earned grade nine. 
To my astonishment, a few weeks later, 
Inquisition HQ came back to me with an 
apology, a correction and confirmation of 
my grade nine. Justice had triumphed.
Several years later, a doubtless vitally 
important government reform of education, 
reversed the polarity of ‘O’ Level grades. 
Grade one had now been recalibrated 
as bottom, while grade nine had been 
redefined  as the new top, pinnacle and 
Everest of Physics excellence.
As stated earlier, Sir Isaac Newton had 
once famously said, when asked who 
were his sources of scientific inspiration: 
“Amicus Platonis”, “Amicus Aristotelis” 
and “Amicus Veritas”. Armed with my 
splendidly revised, shiny grade nine I 
felt, with Newton, that I could now claim 
Amicus Einstein, Amicus Heisenberg and 
in particular Amicus Blind Chance, as my 
new best friends.
From the above it should be clear that I 
was definitely on the humanities side of 
the Niveous Equation, but what impressed 
me, as I progressed through the groves of 
Academe, was that, on the whole (with one 
or two exceptions) mathematicians tended 
to be far more receptive to the arts, than vice 
versa. This was the curious phenomenon 
mentioned in my opening paragraph.
Take, for example, my old friend Nick 
Patterson. As a junior chess player I had 
become used to all opposition crumbling 
before me. Even if I did not necessarily 
win a tournament, I experienced no 
sensation of having encountered a superior 
chess intellect, talent or understanding. 
That changed when I faced Nick in the 
penultimate round of the 1962/63 London 
Under-16 Chess Championship. I had 
been on course to win the title, but Nick 
demolished me in our game and I had to 
be content with a share of second place, 
behind the precocious Bill Hartston, a two 
times future British champion. 
Nick was a brilliant mathematician but also 
a polymath who went on to become a code-
breaker at GCHQ, Irish chess champion, 
alternating top / second board for Ireland 
in the 1970 chess Olympiad at Siegen in 
Germany, a financial data analyst in New 
York and now a key member of the David 
Reich Institute at Harvard, analysing DNA 
to detect the origins of humanity. Nick 
has come up with the theory that humans 
diverged genetically from chimpanzees but 
then briefly (in geological time) merged 
again, before we branched out decisively 
on our own. From my own experience, I can 
well believe it. The theory of a regression 
is eminently plausible. Nick’s DNA work 
also has potential in identifying and 
tracking historic and pre-historic patterns 
and outbreaks of disease.
The New York Times interviewed Nick, 
on December 12, 2006, and, apropos the 
two cultures divide, wrote: “Dr Patterson 
belongs to a new breed of biologist. The 
shelves of his office in Cambridge Mass. 
carry arcane maths titles, yet he can 
converse just as deeply about Buddhism or

04/144

232
Thucydides, whose writings he has studied 
in Ancient Greek.”
Will The New York Times one day reach 
the astonishing conclusion that I am an 
expert in Bayesian statistics or Conway’s 
Group Theory, or even acknowledge the 
fact that I am an undoubted physics genius 
with a stratospheric grade nine at ‘O’ 
Level? Somehow I doubt it.
In the C. P. Snow Lecture at Christ’s 
College Cambridge on October 14, 2009 
(reported in Issue 235 of The Christ’s 
College Magazine, the following year) 
Professor Lisa Jardine explained the chief 
ongoing danger connected with C. P. 
Snow’s identification of the Two Cultures 
Syndrome. The problem stems from 
the fact that politicians responsible for 
national and international policy tend to 
have little or no scientific training. Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher was a rare 
exception, having been a research chemist 
at Somerville College, Oxford, while 
Angela Merkel actually studied Physics at 
Karl Marx University of Leipzig.
As a rule, however, in matters requiring 
scientific 
knowledge, 
Presidents 
and 
Prime Ministers have little scientific 
background. 
For 
example, 
the 
now 
disgraced Jair Bolsonaro studied at The 
Brazilian Military Academy, Donald 
Trump (Economics at Wharton School of 
the University of Pennsylvania), Pedro 
Sanchez (Economics at Complutense 
University 
Madrid), 
David 
Cameron 
(PPE, Oxford), Theresa May (Geography, 
Oxford), Vladimir Putin (Law, Leningrad 
State University) and, of course, Boris 
Johnson (Classics and Ancient History, 
Oxford). Such world leaders must perforce 
surround themselves with scientific gurus, 
whose expertise they cannot verify from 
personal experience.
The relevance to the Coronavirus situation 
and the widespread debate over the 
scientific advice given to governments 
around the world is manifest. Perhaps from 
now on, we should require all world leaders 
to hold a degree in epidemiology before 
being elected to office. More realistically, 
unlike my younger self, aspiring world 
leaders should follow Leonardo da Vinci’s 
exhortation: to see the science in art / the 
art in science, and aim to acquire some 
basic training in scientific method.
As Nick Patterson wrote to me, at least I 
should know the logarithm of 1. Answers 
on a postcard please….
This month’s game is Nick Patterson’s win 
against me, which halted my progress in 
the London Junior Chess Championship. 
My idea of sacrificing rook for knight was 
strategically sound, but tactically defective, 
and should have been prefaced on move 
19 by taking White’s pawn on h4 with my 
queen, giving check.

Openings
    for Amateurs By Pete Tamburro; ptamburro@aol.com 
Attacking patterns out of your Openings (Part I)
I’ve often talked about the "ten-move rule," 
where amateurs lose the thread of their 
opening somewhere between moves ten and 
fifteen. However, once you get to the early 
middle game, do you know the attacking 
patterns that emerge out of the opening you 
pick? In browsing through my 1937 BCM 
volume, I ran across this brilliancy prize 
game by George Koltanowski in the Belgian 
Championship. It’s a Colle System, which 
Kolty made famous in his simul tours and a 
little booklet he used to sell. There’s a joke 
among collectors that the rarest book in chess 
is that Colle book that isn’t signed by him!
The brilliancy calculation must have taken him 
all of 30 seconds to figure out as there were 
two famous wins by Lasker and Tarrasch with 
the same two bishop sacrifice (also included 
in this article). His opponent apparently, and 
innocently, wandered into it because he either 
forgot or never played over those two games. In 
myriad conversations with GMs over the years, 
I was always impressed by their ability to refer 
to either certain games or positions going back 
many years. In Openings for Amateurs, I’ve 
always tried to bring some of these old classics 
in because younger players seem to have no 
idea who played before they were born!

This is not easy to find, but it is easy 
to understand. Black develops a piece 
(notice how many times we say that?), 
prevents e4–e5, and even supports Black 
doing his own thing by putting a piece or 
a pawn on e5, or even f4.

One move suggested in several sources 
and by Stockfish 16 is 10...h6; however, 
the "equal" should be "complicated!" 
Just take one possibility that leads to 
an exchange sacrifice idea that White 
should know: 11.e5 ¤g4 12.¤b3 ¥b6

at 10...e5 11.exd5 ¤xd5 12.¥xh7+ and 
was satisfied with the win of a pawn. 
Reconsidering it years later, it seems 
Black has play for the pawn: (12.¤e4

15.¤g3) ) 12...¢xh7 13.£e4+ ¢g8 
14.£xd5 ¥e7 That’s why it is always 
good, as I also wrote back then, to do 
your own homework and re-evaluate 
positions and moves. 
11.¦e1 ¤g4 "White wants to enforce 
e4–e5. Black wants to prevent it. It’s that 
simple."-Openings for Amateurs book. 
12.h3 ¤ge5 "White chases the defender 
of the e5 square, but the defender becomes 
the occupant--one way to prevent e4–e5!" 
– OFA. 
13.¤xe5 13.¥c2

always consider getting rid of that "Colle" 
bishop. 14...¤xd3 15.£xd3 ¦d8 16.¤f3 h6

out in OFA, is 15...¤xd3 16.£xd3 £c4 
17.£xc4 dxc4 .The flurry of exchanges 
is over. Where swapping queens didn’t 
work before, it works now because 
Black rid himself of his isolated d-pawn 
and created an equal balance of pawns 
on both sides. Black also has the two 
bishops. The position is equal. White 
has a slightly freer position, an excellent 
outpost on d4 for his knight, and easy 
access to the open files for his rooks. 
Black has to bring his rooks and his 
king to the centre to encourage further 
exchanges. It can still get exciting:

26.¢xf4 ¦d2 Black really has to be 
on his toes in this line. This is a pretty 
solid way to defend the Colle, although 
you can see how dangerous it can be. 
It’s good to know the ideas of both 
sides. You can see that one little misstep 
for White on move eight or Black on 
move nine can make a difference in 
the game’s direction. Developing your 
pieces is good. Developing them with 
an overall idea in mind is better. Now 
we come to the part where a mistake by 
the defence in the early middle game 
sets up an opportunity for a decisive 
attack. Just as Black has to know what 
not to do, White has to know what to do 
when Black falters.

P.S. Milner-Barry, in the 1937 BCM, wrote 
"There does not seem to be much wrong 
with Black’s game apart from the minor 
inconvenience of the isolated Pawn. But, as 
usual, the Colle variation is more dangerous 
than it looks."
Indeed. Too often all of us get a little lazy and 
are seduced by the superficial harmlessness 
of a quiet-looking position. In this game, 
¤xf3+ seemed to reduce the material on 
the board, but after this, the very nature of 
the game changed. Even after 20...¥xd4 
21.¦xd4 g6 22.¥b3 a5 23.a3 a4 24.¥xd5

Again Milner-Barry: "Black is unaware 
of the impending catastrophe." He did 
note that Black really didn’t have a good 
move. For example: 21...£b6 22.£g3 g6 
23.h4 bxc3 24.bxc3 ¦fe8 25.£f4 ¥d6

famous Lasker-Bauer game was played in 
1889 and Nimzovich-Tarrasch followed 
the theme in 1914, Kolty must have been 
pleased to join the immortals. Defosse, on 
the other hand, had to resolve to study more 
classic games. 
22...¢xh7 
23.£h5+ 
¢g8 
24.¥xg7

be ignored by Black; however, the result 
would be the same. 24...f6 25.£h8+ ¢f7 
26.¥xf8 ¥xf8 27.£h5+ ¢e7 28.£h7+ 
¢d6 29.¦xe6+ ¢xe6 30.£xc7+–.

27.¢h1

28.¦xf4

achieves his goal of avoiding the 
miniature games books.
1–0
  
That’s the first lesson. It’s important to 
recognize positions that give you decisive 
attacks. Now, if you do that, you’re 
only halfway there. The second half is 
recognising those patterns as they start 
to emerge. It’s one thing to have seen the 
Lasker or Tarrasch games and another 
to study how they emerged out of the 
opening. That’s the flaw in many tactical 
study books today. They give you the 
position and essentially say, "OK, here’s 
the mate. Find it!" Very few show you 
the whole game so you can see it form 
as you approach it. For defenders, such 
as Defosse, they also have to be aware of 
those emerging possibilities.

I was going over Nigel Short’s games 
from his book “Winning”. I always liked 
Nigel and rooted for him in the 1980s 
and 1990s as he was the “best from the 
West” and I was curious to see how far 
he could go.
The games in the book are very 
interesting and revealing. One aspect that 
I found surprising was how sometimes 
these great players could have bad days 
and how easily they could be affected by 
psychological factors. 
The following two games are good 
examples of both of these factors.
In the game Short-Timman from 
Reykjavik 1987, Black obtained a 
decent position in the French. However, 
instead of slower moves that improve

his position (Short proposed …¢b8-a8) 
he lashed out with 14…f5??, which only 
gave him a hopeless position in exchange 
for a couple of tempi spent to bring the 
knight to e4, from where it was duly 
chased away.
Here’s the position after seven moves, when 
Black is positionally lost. I found it really 
strange that a player of Timman’s strength, 
easily a top five player at the time, could 
commit such a bad positional mistake.
 
In the game Polugaevsky-Short from 
the same event, Short obtained a good 
position from the obscure opening 
1.¤f3 d6. It resembles a Sicilian, 
where Black is very comfortable. 
Instead of simple play 17…a6 and b5, 
Short played 17…d5, which while not 
bad (though he criticises this decision 
in the book) shows a desire to force 
matters. In fact, Short admits to being 
rattled and feeling uncomfortable after 
the loss in the previous round. After 
18.e5 ¤e4 19.¥xe4 dxe4 20.¥e3 he 
started to see ghosts and feared losing 
his e4-pawn.
So, instead of calmly doubling on 
the d-file, he lashed out with 20…f5? 
21.exf6 ¥xf6 22.¥f2 and what he feared 
he single-handedly made happen – he 
lost the pawn on e4. He managed to draw 
the game, but it was not a good pair of 
decisions. In this case, the curious part 
is his confession of playing under the 
influence of his previous game.
This example shows that when GMs 
demonstrate clear misevaluations or 
play bad moves, there is always an 
underlying reason for that. It’s just that 
we rarely get to know it, a sin Timman’s 
case, as honesty is rarely the best policy 
in the world of elite sport – revealing 
too much about oneself can easily help 
the opposition.
Not everybody will be honest even after 
their career ends, which makes these 
glimpses even more valuable.

In the last few years, the publishing 
house Elk and Ruby has been providing 
an invaluable service to English-
speaking chess players who do not 
read Russian by producing splendid 
translations of works about players 
and events mostly involving the Soviet 
Union. The three books reviewed here 
reinforce this service, at the same 
time as adding a volume (originally 
in Russian) on one of the outstanding 
players of the German-speaking realm, 
Rudolf Spielmann. All of these books 
are labelled “Chess Biographies”. What 
this term means is that, while each work 
gives us something about the life and 
times of the player, their biographies 
are traced through their chess-related 
activities. The focus on the “chess 
personality” of the player almost 
inevitably invites a reassessment of the 
contribution made to the development 
of chess and to the circumstances in 
which the player made that contribution. 
Seen from this perspective of hindsight, 
the three players in question offer an 
unusually rich array of insights.
Spielmann is the best known, and the 
standard picture of him is that of a hugely 
gifted combinative master who could give 
as good as he took with the world’s best 
during his lifetime. Rauzer is recognizable 
to most through his contributions to chess 
theory, especially in a couple of openings, 
the Sicilian and the French. Verlinsky is 
maybe less well-known outside Russia. It

may surprise many to learn that he was, 
in fact, the first grandmaster of the Soviet 
Union. How come more has not been heard 
of such a player? The trio of volumes 
here seek to adjust our ways of seeing 
these players, both through deepening 
our understanding of what we think we 
already knew and throughopening our 
horizons on many things of which we 
were most likely unaware. 
Despite the differences in the contexts in 
which the three lived, they shared some 
key characteristics. All were Jewish 
and had to cope with the unprecedented 
horrors of those times and places. For 
them, 
chess 
effectively 
represented 
their lives. Spielmann stated that it 
was his profession  and that at a time 
when very few would make the same 
affirmation. Unfortunately, the epoch in 
which he lived offered scarce prospects 
for sustaining such a profession and he 
died in chronic poverty in 1942. Rauzer, 
as the title of Konstantinopolsky’s book 
indicates, became literally obsessed with 
the game. Though his friends eventually 
found him a plausible job providing 
little income, he in fact devoted all of 
his waking hours to the search for truth 
within chess. His theoretical insights 
therefore went far beyond the opening 
theory ideas which have traditionally 
been the source of his fame. He too died in 
1942, in appalling circumstances during 
the siege of Leningrad. As for Verlinsky, 
let us listen to that wonderful player 
and incomparable authority on chess 
in the USSR, namely Yuri Averbakh. 
He was a good friend of Verlinsky and 
said: “Chess was everything for him, 
and he brought the philosophy of this 
wise game to everyone who was ready to 
receive it” (cited on p.10 of Tkachenko’s 
book). Verlinsky died in 1950, at the age 
of 62, While this may appear seem like 
longevity compared with Spielmann and 
Rauzer, the first grandmaster of the USSR 
had in fact been virtually deaf since birth, 
survived several Jewish pogroms and 
suffered other brutal difficulties. Hence 
for all three adversity was a constant in 
their lives.
The core of Bogdanovich’s reassessment 
of Spielmann is contained in five chapters, 
occupying over 300 pages, of which one, 
roughly 100 pages in length, examines 
his legendary attacking skills, The next 
four, 
however, 
highlight 
successively 
Spielmann’s art as a defender, his positional 
mastery, the knowledge of opening theory, 
and his prowess in the endgame. It is 
after these very important chapters that 
Bogdanovich takes us into a series of issues 
which would be a real bonus to find in other 
biographies of players and their games. 
The first of those issues is what the author 
labels “The Costs of Style”. A risk-taker
Despite the differences in the contexts in

condemns himself to occasions when the 
endeavour backfires, and he loses. Some 
of these defeats are at the hands of the 
greats, such as Botvinnik, Schlechter and 
Nimzowitsch. But some also happened 
with somewhat less renowned, though 
still superb, players. If you play with fire, 
the chances of being burned are all too 
real. Think of Real Madrid waiting for 
added time to score the decisive goals, of 
Djokovic risking innumerable tie-breaks, 
or of Goggia, Schifrin and Brignone 
banking everything on split seconds. 
The spectators want nail-biting tension. 
A second issue relates to what John 
Nunn enunciated as the DAUT principle 
(‘Don’t Analyse Unnecessary Tactics”). 
Simply put, Nunn gives us the very 
sound advice that, if we can reinforce 
our position (especially an attacking one) 
through straightforward moves involving 
little risk, we should do so. Spielmann 
certainly did not always follow this. 
Hence Bogdanovich gives examples 
of the extent to which an ”anti-DAUT” 
approach might not be so good. A third 
issue, once more revolving around the 
subject of risk assessment in chess, relates 
to the cases where “pragmatism” prevails. 
Bogdanovich, 
following 
well-known 
remarks of Tartakower, calls this cynicism 
and asks whether Spielmann could also 
be labelled a chess cynic. The answer 
is that there are many instances where 
the great Viennese master calculated his 
options very well. His style may have had 
its costs, but they were mostly kept well 
under control.
The Rauzer book has the valuable feature 
of bringing together older contributions by 
Soviet players who knew the man and his 
work very well. Thus a Konstantinopolsky 
article of 1989 describes Rauzer as its author 
knew him; Yudovich and Fogelevich, in a 
short piece probably written in the mid-
1930s, provide an early look at Rauzer’s 
theoretical contributions: Lazarev, writing 
in 1975, underlines how Rauzer went 
about his theoretical work and highlights 
also the contributions to endgame theory;
 
while Botvinnik, in a vignette published 
in 1990, states categorically that “there 
is every reason to place V Rauzer among 
the founders of the Soviet school, 
which defined the development of chess 
thought for many years” (p.48). These 
assessments are followed by a large 
selection of games showing the depth of 
Rauzer’s work. He was unquestionably 
driven by the idea that the game 
contained absolute truth and this should 
be sought whatever the circumstances. 
That notion was bad both for practical 
results and Rauzer’s mental and physical 
health. It also led to huge generalisations, 
in particular his total conversion, from 
the early 1930s onwards, to playing 
only 1.e4. This was in direct contrast 
to Breyer’s earlier statement that, after 
this opening move, White’s game was 
in its last death throes. Breyer was in 
the hypermodern vein, while Rauzer’s 
enormous theoretical efforts were in 
defence of classicism in the game.
I am not sure I can do full justice to 
Tkachenko’s 
magnificent 
book 
on 
Verlinsky in a short review. Partly this 
“…There is every reason to place V 
Rauzer among the founders of the Soviet 
school, which defined the development 
of chess thought for many years”

|
is because his life as a Ukrainian Jewish 
person living in a terrible era is a 
theme which is of personal interest to 
me, while here I must sell Tkachenko’s 
detailed observations short. It is also 
partly because we are talking about 
a brilliant player who could beat the 
world’s very best and did indeed win 
the 1929 Soviet championship. That 
this master of the attack is nowhere 
near the first name that comes to mind 
when discussing “the Soviet school” 
is most likely due to a mix of the way 
the USSR itself officially presented 
its players and to gaps in our research. 
Tkachenko has gone a very long way 
towards correcting things. There are 
130 games and game fragments where 
the opponents represent more or less 
the “Who’s Who” of Soviet chess till 
the end of the 1940s. The material 
leaves us in no doubt that Verlinsky 
was a superb competitor, fighting 
lifelong battle against severe obstacles, 
somehow surviving through most of 
the Stalinist times, and never failing 
to produce works of art. Indeed, the 
author’s opening lines are “dedicated to 
Chess Heroes who produce works of art 
against the Odds!” The book contains a 
large selection of photos which portray 
many of Verlinsky’s chess opponents, 
but also splendid historical pictures of 
places significant in Ukrainian history. 
Thus, somewhat in contrast to the 
books on Spielmann and Rauzer, this 
work is devoted both to the man and 
his circumstances.
In earlier BCM articles, I have argued 
that excellent volumes on outstanding 
players of the past not only tell us much 
about the real history of the game, but 
are also major insights into historical 
periods and their consequences. With 
this fine set of books, Elk and Ruby has 
once more reiterated the message.
DAVID'S DOUBLE
Two British Chess Solving Championships on 
the trot for David Hodge. He was the winner 
last year, and he retained his title this year 
David only won narrowly, both times, because 
the evergreen Professor Jonathan Mestel came 
very close to overtaking him. Mestel has 
himself won the title many times and is also a 
former World Chess Solving Champion.
Third place - one of the regulars? No, a 
newcomer. Audrey Kueh, with no previous 
experience 
at 
solving 
championships, 
although a strong over-the-board player, 
achieved a superb score. Audrey narrowly 
edged ahead of Kamila Hryshchenko for 
the bronze medal position. Kamila did get 
a major prize, however - that for the best 
solving performance over the last 12 months. 
During 2023/24, she won multiple prizes, 
had a massive increase in solving Elo rating, 
and became a regular member of the British 
solving team at international competitions.
In parallel with the British Championship 
there is an Open held, at the same time and 
with the same problems to solve. This was 
won by one of the world’s best solvers, Eddy 
van Beers from Belgium, with Vidmantas 
Satkus of Lithuania and Abdelaziz Onkoud 
of France in silver and bronze positions. 
The competitions were held at the splendid 
site of Harrow School, on February 17th. 
They were sponsored by Winton, the 
quantitative investment management firm 
(winton.com). 
In chess solving events, competitors try to 
solve chess problems, such as White to play 
and force mate in three moves, against the 
clock. Points are awarded for how much of 
the solution the solver finds.

Endgame Studies

April 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 249
Your challenge this month is to solve the studies used in the Winton British Chess Solving 
Championship. If you can, you will have beaten every competitor. No-one got a perfect 
score in the study-solving round. 
At this year’s finals, some of the world’s top solvers came to Britain to compete against 
the British solvers. Even the overall winner, Eddy van Beers from Belgium, did not fully 
solve either of the two studies in the Open event. Five competitors did succeed with the 
first of those two studies, but no-one fully solved the second one. David Hodge, who won 
the British Champion title, got five out of five for the first, but only one out of five for 
the second. 
There is also another event (the Minor) that takes place simultaneously with the main 
event, but with somewhat easier problems to solve. In this event there are also two studies; 
only the winner, Gautam Jain, fully solved both of them. 
The first two studies, composed by Travasoni and Afek, are the ones from the Minor. The 
Abramenko and Zachodjakin are the ones from the Open event. I have put the four studies 
in ascending order of difficulty so that you can build up to the toughest.
The usual solving procedures apply: You’ll need to set up these positions on a board. In 
solving events, you can use a chess set and you can move the pieces to try and help you 
solve. You solve against the clock; for these four studies give yourself an average of 30 
minutes for each one, so 120 minutes in total. Points are awarded according to how much 
of the composer’s solution you find, with five points available for each study if you find 
it all. In the answers, I’ll show you where the points were awarded. You need to find the 
composer’s main line; you can also write down sidelines if you’re not sure what the main 
line is, but only the main line moves earn points. So, look for the most artistic, elegant line. 
All the problems used in the events are on the British Chess Problem Society website; 
visit www.theproblemist.org and click on WBCSC. There you can also access the 2023-
24 Postal Round problems; the British Championship is an annual event with qualifying 
stages, including a stage in which a set of problems are sent out by e-mail/post. So, you 
can practice your solving using the 2023-24 problems to get yourself ’match-fit’ for the 
2024-25 qualifying stages!

6253 The breakthrough player of 1924 was 
that of Carlos Torre Repetto. He won the 
Louisiana championship in 1923, scoring 
+12 =2, then moved to New York and was 
not overawed by the challenge. 
Torre entered for the championship of the 
New York State Chess Association, to be held 
at Rochester. There were nine entrants, Torre 
scored +6=2 and tied for first place with 
1915 champion Harold Jennings. Roy Black 
was third a point behind. Here is Torre’s game 
against the player placed fourth.

Torre moved swiftly on and just a couple 
of days later he was competing at Detroit 
in an eighteen-player all play all. This 
was a much tougher event, where his 
opponents included the previous year’s 
winners Norman Whitaker and Stasch 
Mlotkowski, draughts champion Newell 
Banks plus two players of Polish origin 
who would go on to represent the USA 
in olympiads, Sam Factor and young 
Sammy Reshevsky.
A couple of early withdrawals clouded 
the picture for a while. Torre had +8=1 
at the end of round ten, a win by default 
followed and +3=3 thereafter. He won 
the event by a two-and-a-half-point 
margin. The next game was played in the 
opening round.

When he returned to New York Torre 
contested a four-game tie match with 
Jennings. Torre lost game one, but equalised 
at once, demonstrating exemplary skill with 
the two bishops in the endgame. 
Game three was a French Defence where 
the players castled on opposite wings. 
Torre’s attack was the swifter, which 
left Jennings having to win with black in

This was the easiest because White has to keep Black bottled-up and so has very little 
choice at each move.

It’s obvious that White must keep threatening mate, but unless you envisage the eventual

Quite a lot of options in this one, as you would expect in a competition for the best solvers. 
Still, 1.¦c1 followed by 2.¦c7+ seemed to me to the most plausible. What I didn’t find 
was the manoeuvre 5.¤d3 and 6.¤e5+ which is only plausible if it occurs to you that you 
might be able to mate the Black king on the right-hand edge of the board.

drawing because the queen will be exchanged - the White bishop will finally get to the 
long diagonal. Black’s choices of king moves were to prevent the bishop getting to the 
long diagonal. The White king needs to have gone to a6 to avoid there being any Black 
queen checks in the final position.
Once you notice that Black will play ...¤c3+ and ¤b1 when you play ¦h1, the rook 
check on h7 feels like a good idea as it gives you the option of a check from e1 which 
will protect the bishop. I got that far but didn’t know where to place the White king after 
...¤c3+. I even had the idea that the solution would finish with the rook delivering a 
perpetual check, but I couldn’t find the only correct way to achieve that. So, only 1 out of 
5. Oh, well, I was in strong company.

Solutions to Problems
A neatly keyed three-mover
One expects that in a good three-mover 
the key move will not be too obviously 
strong, but it is especially commendable 
when the second move that the key 
move threatens is itself also a quiet 
move. Thus in our first problem 1.¥d2! 
threatens 2.£g5, after which Black 
would be unable to defend against the 
impending 3.£e3#. So Black must 
use his first move to prepare a second-
move defence. Such a defence would 
be 2…¥xd3, preparing a defence by 
3…¢xc4. Black cannot prepare this 
by 1…¥c2 (2.Sxf3#), but why not 
1…¥e2? The answer is the continuation 
2.¤e4!, threatening 3.£c3#. On move 
one this move, intercepting the h7-d3 
line, would fail against 1…¢xd3, and if 
2.£c3+ then 2…¢e2. But after 1.¥d2 
¥e2 the defence 2…¢e2 is impossible. 
In problem parlance, it turns out that 
1…¥e2 is a remote self-block – always 
testing for a solver to visualize, and 
adding to the aesthetic charm of the 
problem. A similar requirement for 
foresight is required in the line 1…
f2 (threatening to guard e3 by means 
of 2…f1=¤) 2.¥c3+ and now after 
2…¢e3 3.£e5 is mate because Black 
has obligingly blocked f2. The other 
lines are 1…e5 2.¥e4 when 3.¤f5# is 
unavoidable and 1…¥xf6 2.¢xf6 and 
when Black prevents 3.£e5 by playing 
2…c5 there is 3.£c3#.
Déjà vu?
Regular readers may recognize that 
our second problem bears a similarity 
to a five-mover by Paul Michelet that 
appeared in the January Problem World. 
Steven Dowd, who had also contributed 
an original problem to that issue, upon 
seeing the five-mover saw a way to 
add a couple of introductory moves 
that would (he felt, I’d feel, and, much 
more to the point, Paul felt) enhance the 
problem. Now it is the case that mating 
Black does still rely upon advancing the 
white pawn, but trying to do so straight 
away is unsuccessful. Instead White 
prepares the way by playing 1.¤g5! 
¢g7 2.¤hf7!, and now after 2…¢f6 or 
2…¢f8 we get the previously seen and 
very appealing sequence 3.e4 ¢g7 4.e5 
¢f8 5.e6 ¢g7 6.e7 ¢f6 7.e8=¤#. 
Some people may deprecate such two-
move intros that serve only to set up 
the main play – others (including me) 
find that this sort of intro not only adds 
to solving difficulty but, by hiding the 
beautiful idea more deeply, adds also 
to aesthetic appeal. (This can also be 
an issue when evaluating endgame 
studies.) What do you think – which 
camp are you in?
Two three-move helpmates
In Stanislav’s helpmate, the white 
knight is well placed to deliver mate, 
This month’s problems
As usual, we start with the shortest direct mate problem, but this time the three-
mover, typically for its composers, requires you to find a neat key move, against 
which there are a number of defences, each refuted by a specific white second move, 
and so may well not be the easiest to solve (you may prefer just to enjoy reading 
through the solution); while our second problem, a first collaboration by another 
two of our valued regular contributors, may be more tractable, especially if you 
remember another recent offering by Paul Michelet in this column. Finally we have 
two helpmates – in each we are looking for two collaborative bwbwbw sequences of 
moves ending in Black being mated.

but we must somehow deal with the 
black king’s potential flight squares. 
A pleasing element of contrast is seen 
in that although in one solution we 
activate the white rook to guard flight 
squares – 1.a4 (remember that, as per 
helpmate convention, this is in fact 
Black‘s first move) ¢e2 2.¢a5 ¦b1 
3.¦a6 ¤b7# - in the other solution 
the white rook must be sacrificed so 
that Black can block a flight square 
– 1.e2 ¦f1 2.exf1=¥ ¤b7 3.¥b5 
¤c5#. A nice blend of similarities and 
dissimilarities, albeit in a perfect world 
one might perhaps want not to have to 
play …¤b7 in both solutions.
In Ljubomir’s helpmate, we find that 
pawn promotion (a feature, one way or 
another, in all our problems this month) 
comes centre stage in two well matched 
solutions – 1.¦e7+ fxe7 2.¥d8 exd8=¥ 
3.c4 ¥b6# and 1.£g7 fxg7 2.¦h8+ 
gxh8=¦ 3.e3 ¦h4#. When I say that 
promotions are a feature I could be more 
specific and say under-promotions - in 
contrast to games of chess this is the norm 
in chess composition. Note too that in 
this problem White promotes to the same 
type of piece that Black sacrifices on 
move two (Phoenix theme). And in both 
Stanislav’s and Ljubomir’s problems we

t’s a game that has been around for 
hundreds of years. There are 3D versions 
of it, giant versions of it and even a musical 
has been written about it. Chess is one of the 
best known board games in the world, popular 
for its strategy, variance and the fact that it 
can be picked up and played by people of all 
ages. Chess is a test of concentration, creativity, 
endurance and tactics and this bookazine will 
teach you all you need to know in order to play 
this historic game.
You’ll find out all about the history and origins 
of chess, how it was a crucial battleground in the 
midst of the Cold War, the tools and accessories 
you need to be able to fully enjoy the game and, 
most importantly, the tricks, move sets, opening 
and closing moves that will set you apart from all 
the other wannabe Grandmasters.
Chess is a pastime that transcends class,  
race, age and gender boundaries and this 
bookazine will allow you to become a part of 
that rich culture.

10  Chess for Beginners
Complete guide
T
he aim of chess is to capture your 
opponent’s king. At the beginning 
of the game, each of you has 16 
pieces on the board: eight pawns, two 
rooks, two bishops, two knights, a queen 
and a king. All the pieces move in different 
ways, leading to a near endless variety 
of gameplay positions. Every time one 
of your pieces wants to land on a square 
that is already occupied by one of your 
opponent’s pieces, you move your piece to 
that square and remove your opponent’s, 
which is then out of the game. This is 
called ‘taking’ the piece. 
Each of you is trying to manoeuvre 
your pieces in such a way as to get the 
opponent’s king stuck in a trap so that 
no matter what move they make, the 
king will get taken next turn. Once you’ve 
reached that stage and there is no way 
for your opponent to not have their king 
taken, the game is over and you get to say 
‘Checkmate’ and emerge victorious. 
The trickiest element of chess is to 
ensure you aren’t being led into a trap 
yourself. It’s very easy to get so wrapped 
up in setting up your own king-capturing 
situation that you miss the trap being set 
by your opponent. Good players are able 
to read what you are planning and can 
manoeuvre their pieces in such a way that 
they wait until you make your move, take a 
key piece of yours and scupper your plan.
Planning is very important in chess. Top 
players are able to think several moves 
in advance, placing pieces in seemingly 
pointless positions in order to set up an 
attack when the final piece of the move 
set gets put into place. It’s a bit like a jigsaw 
puzzle. The entire thing can look very 
strange and disjointed until a crucial piece 
gets added and all of a sudden the picture 
becomes clear. It is also very common 
for players to sacrifice pieces in order to 
strengthen their position. It is well worth 
putting a pawn, which is the most limited 
piece, in a position to be taken in order to 
set up the capture of an opponent’s rook, 
knight, bishop, queen or king, all of which 
are much more valuable to the player.
All in all, chess is a reasonably easy game 
to learn in terms of how pieces move, 
but learning how to play it well is much 
more time-consuming. Ultimately, you are 
trying to catch the king, but getting there 
requires skill, ingenuity and an ability to 
outthink your opponent.
Aim of the game
You’ve probably heard someone say ‘checkmate’ when  
they’ve won an argument. This is how to say it for real
FACT
Who’s first?
In chess the person playing as 
the white pieces always goes 
first. It is generally thought 
that this gives that player an 
advantage, so the players 
alternate which colour they  
are playing as during  
a match.

C
hess, in its original form, dates 
back around 1,500 years to the 
Hindu Gupta Empire in India, 
whose people were famous for their 
artistic and creative flair. They brought 
the game to Persia (modern-day Iran) 
around 600CE, calling it Chaturanga, 
Sanskrit for ‘four parts’. It was played on 
an 8x8 board with ten pieces making up 
four different ranks: five soldiers, three 
cavalry pieces, a chariot and an elephant.
This game spread across Asia and the 
Middle East, the rules being adapted 
to suit local customs and traditions. In 
Persia, it was used to educate royalty in 
the art of strategy in war. 
Once the Persian Empire made way for 
the Muslim Ottoman Empire, there was 
concern that the game would be banned 
under the Qur’an’s anti-gambling laws, 
but the game instead flourished.
The game then spread to China 
around the year 800 and was hugely 
popular for its strategy. Chess then 
moved back westwards, being brought 
to Spain in the eighth century, Russia in 
History of chess
Where chess originated and why it has been important –  
from entertaining royalty to establishing dominance in war
the ninth century and England in 1012 
with the Vikings.
Finally in 1100, the board began  
to look like the one we know today,  
§with alternating light and dark  
squares. The English began to tinker 
yet further with the rules, speeding 
up games by allowing the queen 
and bishop a much larger range of 
movements, so much so that the queen 
went from being the weakest to the 
strongest piece. 
Czar Nicholas II of Russia coined the 
phrase ‘Grandmaster’, a term which now 
refers to a select group of people who 
have mastered the game and compete 
at the very highest level. Today there are 
fewer than 1,500 Grandmasters in the 
world, with Russia topping the list with 
226 and Ukraine and USA joint second 
with 84 apiece.
Chess became a political tool during 
the Cold War between the USA and the 
Soviet Union in the 1970s. American 
Bobby Fischer was a fast-rising star of 
the game and threatened to loosen the 
stranglehold the Soviets had had on the 
World Chess title for nearly a quarter of 
a century. The pressure on both Fischer 
and his championship opponent 
Boris Spassky was enormous 
because victory for either 
side would be a huge 
statement of power. 
Despite losing the first 
two games and looking 
out of his depth, Fischer 
won by 12.5 to 8.5 and 
claimed the coveted title, 
sparking wild celebrations 
among the Americans.
FACT
An exclusive club
As of 2014 there have been 
just 20 world champions in 
128 years. The first champion 
was Prague-born Wilhelm 
Steinitz, who was crowned 
champion in 1886 and held 
the title for eight years.
FACT
Chess:

group ABBA, Benny Andersson 
and Björn Ulvaeus worked 
together on a musical called

famous Cold War chess

There are many benefits to playing 
chess, no matter what your age is. 
Many young people nowadays don’t have 
the same level of social interaction that 
children had in previous generations, so a 
sociable, cross-generational game is one 
that could prove to be of great benefit to 
people who need to have a boost to their 
self esteem or social skills.
It has been shown on many occasions 
that sports can provide people with a 
range of skills and benefits far beyond the 
obvious and as there are so many different 
elements to chess, it is little wonder that 
there is a wide range of studies showing 
the mental, social and, let’s not forget, 
fun benefits of one of the world’s oldest 
pastimes. Of course, there are a number 
of other ways that people can learn these 
skills, but chess has a surprising number of 
interesting benefits.
5 It’s fun!
Lastly, the game of chess is fun! 
It can be a serious game, with many 
tournaments happening every year, but 
the main aspect of this social game is 
enjoyment. You can pick it up at any 
age and play it with anyone. It can be as 
serious, or as joyful as you make it.
4 Sense of teamwork
Despite chess being a solitary game, 
it actually is fantastic for teaching a young 
child the importance of working as a team. 
A queen can’t defeat an entire enemy 
force by herself – she needs the help of 
those who, on the surface, are much less 
powerful than her.
3 Social interaction
Chess is a great way of getting to 
meet people of all walks of life. No matter 
what your age is or what language you 
speak, chess is universally understood, so 
anyone can walk into a new place and 
settle down into a game of chess and 
maybe make new friends.
1 Problem solving 
When you are not only trying to 
defeat your opponent with subtly skilful 
moves but also prevent yourself from 
being put into a trap, chess has a unique 
ability to help people deal with two 
objectives at once and teaches children to 
focus on secondary objectives.
2 Concentration 
One of the joys and frustrations of chess is that one false move can completely turn 
the tide of a game. If you accidentally lose your queen or miss an opportunity to take a 
vital opposition piece, the game could be up, so concentration is key, potentially over long 
periods of time.

chess and how can they be improved upon over time?

Glass board
This really is the crème de la crème of chessboards. Elegant, refined 
and smooth-looking, a glass chessboard will look good in any 
environment. When buying a glass board, make sure that the 
squares are easy to make out and, again, try to keep it somewhere 
that it won’t get chipped, because that will reduce the value.
Marble board
Marble boards are fairly heavy and impractical, but they do look 
gorgeous and provide one of the most satisfying clinks you’ll ever 
hear as you place your piece down. Be extremely careful with these 
as they are prone to smashing, but will be the most resilient when 
it comes to chips and breakages from normal play.
Wooden board 
A simple wooden board is one of the easiest places to begin. 
Ensure that the board is solid and smoothly finished. You do not 
want one that will break after a few years of use. If you want that 
extra touch of class, a board with hand-carved engravings will 
stand the test of time and retain a timeless, classic feel.
Plastic board
For starter players, a plastic board might be the best to invest in. 
Firstly, it will be the safest as there is little risk of splinters, especially 
if it is not looked after brilliantly. It will also not matter too much if 
it is the object of a temper tantrum, as can so easily happen when 
someone is learning a game and doesn’t win too often.
Buying a board
What to look for when buying a chessboard
O
n the surface, it shouldn’t really 
be difficult to buy a chess set. 
All you really need is a board 
measuring eight squares by eight squares 
and 32 pieces – 16 black and 16 white. 
However, there is a little more to it than 
that. One of the key things to think about 
when buying a chess set is who you are 
buying it for and for what purpose. If you 
are buying for a young person who is just 
learning, it is worth buying a set in which 
the pieces are very clearly defined as their 
characters, so bishops cannot get muddled 
up with rooks, and kings and queens are 
clearly differentiated to avoid confusion 
and error. It might even be worth buying a 
custom or novelty set with popular TV or 
gaming characters so each piece is easily 
recognised and the child retains interest.
However, if you are buying a quality set 
to keep as an heirloom, you cannot go 
wrong with wooden boards and marble or 
glass pieces, as they will retain and increase 
their long-term value.

S
o what exactly will you need to get before you are able 
to properly enjoy playing chess? Firstly, the board is your 
most crucial purchase. As mentioned previously, there is a 
wide range of options available to the budding chess player. You 
have to decide what kind of commitment you want to make to 
the game before deciding a level of expenditure on the board 
and pieces, as sets can range from a few pounds to several 
thousand pounds. You will also need to decide what pieces you 
will buy. Many chessboards come with pieces included, but you 
may wish to buy a set separately. The two most important pieces 
to get right are the knights and the king. The knights are often 
the most intricate, and a well-carved/shaped knight could make 
or break a set. Similarly, the king is the most important piece on 
the board, so you will want to get one that stands tall and looks 
impressive. Everything comes down to taste and cost, but it is 
always recommended to get a decent set that will last.
You will also need to develop a strategy for playing. While 
at first you might think that every game progresses at random, 
you will eventually try to become a player that reflects your 
personality. You might be cautious, unwilling to even sacrifice 
a pawn in pursuit of victory, or you might be brash and bold, 
happy to see a few of your own pieces go down in pursuit of 
your target. 
Alongside your player strategy is your opening gambit. 
This is essentially your first few moves. It is a good idea to not 
only have a few of these in your locker, designed to gain an 
early advantage, but it is also handy to recognise a move your 
opposition is making in order to head them off at the earliest 
opportunity. This is a skill that will come with time, however. The 
other final option is a chess clock that measure each player’s 
move time in a timed match.
A
s technology has advanced, computer scientists have 
been keen to teach computers how to play chess. There 
was a famous match in 1997 where the IBM computer Deep 
Blue beat reigning world champion Garry Kasparov over six games. 
Electronic chessboards allow a player to practise against a 
computer opponent. Computers are able to analyse hundreds 
of moves every second and work out statistically the best move. 
This will allow players to learn how to play against a purely logical 
machine and try out different strategies without having to engage a 
human opponent for training purposes.
They can be hooked up to a range of different devices and 
chess programs, some even allowing you to play matches against 
opposition over the internet, while still having a physical board and 
pieces in front of you. They will usually have a USB connection, while 
some can work wirelessly via Bluetooth.

 Place the rooks on the corners of 
the board, the bishops one in from 
them, the knights one more space in, 
the king to the right of the queen and 
the eight pawns in front of them.
 Pawns can move one space 
forward, rooks in straight lines, 
bishops diagonally, the queen in 
straight or diagonal lines, and the 
king one space in any direction.
 Knights move either one step, then 
two at right angles to that or two 
steps then one step at right angles to 
that, like an L. A knight can therefore 
jump over other pieces.
 White always moves first. At this 
stage you can only move a pawn or a 
knight, as all others are hemmed in.
 If your piece lands on the same 
square as an opposition piece, you 
take it off the board, out of the game 
and put your piece on that square.
 Despite the common belief that if 
you can take a piece, you have to, it 
is in fact an incorrect assumption. If 
your piece is lined up to take a piece, 
you are under no obligation to do so. 
 Take it in turns to move one piece 
alternately, each go ending once 
the piece has gone as far as it can or 
wants to. You don’t have to move 
until you reach the board edge.
 The game ends when the king 
cannot move without being taken 
next turn and none of its subjects can 
block it from being taken next turn. 
Checkmate is declared.
Rules
How to set up, play and 
finish a game of chess
C
hess is generally considered 
to be a refined game, but that 
doesn’t mean that players are 
above a bit of gamesmanship. However, 
it was Benjamin Franklin in his 1779 
essay ‘The Morals of Chess’ who laid 
down the guideline that victors in chess 
should ‘not… use any triumphing or 
insulting expression, nor show too much 
pleasure; but endeavour to console [their] 
opponent’. That is an attitude generally 
considered the correct one even to this 
day. Each player will sit either side of the 
board, with their pieces closest to them. 
While your opponent is considering or 
taking their move, it is generally accepted 
that you should remain quiet and 
reasonably still so as not to distract them 
from making their move. It is a very quiet 
game, with little room for distracting 
opponents. This is partly because of 
good sportsmanship, but also because 
competitive games are timed and it is 
recommended that you should be working 
out your next move to put pressure back 
on your opponent, rather than trying to 
distract them.
It is fairly common in chess to agree a draw 
when it appears that there is little chance of 
a result, too many pieces having been lost 
or both sides having put up a solid defence. 
A draw can be offered, but  if it is not 
accepted, the game continues until a draw 
is offered again by either player. You are not 
obliged to say yes or  no to the offer of a 
draw, but if a stalemate is looking likely, it is 
often best to move onto the next match.
Players will often concede a match as 
well if they can see little way of escaping 
from a situation that is very much against 
them. Again, this should not be taken as 
a slight and is a reasonable reaction to 
an unsaveable situation so that the next 
match can begin.
Despite the offer or a concession looking 
like a churlish reaction to losing or at least 
not winning a game, this is part and parcel 
of the honour code in chess.

C
hess, with all its different pieces, 
rules and move sets, can be quite 
a daunting game to take up for a 
young child. Therefore, the key is to make 
it a fun and rewarding experience. The first 
step is making the game seem accessible. 
This could be as simple as buying a 
novelty board with their favourite cartoon 
characters as pieces.
The next step is drip-feeding them 
information on how to play the game. It 
can be quite boggling to remember the 
different ways the pieces move, so you 
can build it up by letting the pieces move 
anywhere, then steadily introducing the 
piece-specific moves so they learn steadily.
While they’ll need to learn how to lose 
a game, it is important to be encouraging 
and not too ruthless, letting occasional 
mistakes and gameplay indiscretions slide, 
steadily becoming stricter with the rules.
If the rules of the game are slowly 
drip-fed to a child instead of piled on all 
at once, it will help them to feel like they 
are learning and improving, rather than 
getting bogged down in the detail of 
the game and becoming frustrated and 
bored. When beginning to read, you start 
off learning how to recognise letters, then 
words then finally sentences; so in chess, 
you learn the aim of the game, how to play 
it and then the finer points.
Encourage the child to experiment with 
new moves and allow them a bit of grace 
when starting in order to keep the fun 
alive. Over time, you can then point out 
mistakes made and offer the chance to 
redo a move so that they can learn without 
losing a piece. Obviously this should only 
be the case while they’re still learning 
because once they’ve mastered the basics, 
the next step is planning ahead and 
avoiding being placed in a trap.
Chess could be seen as being less 
interesting than a videogame or active

bother and looks great.
I
t is said of a lot of pursuits that learning to play or do it is easy, 
learning to play or do it well is very difficult. This is true for 
playing golf, a musical instrument, even poker. Therefore, the real 
challenge to the budding chess Grandmaster is how to advance 
to the next level. Building on the basic understanding of the rules 
is key to going on to bigger and better things and getting more 
out of the game. Repeated playing of the game will teach you 
a number of things. Opening gambits are things that you can 
practise time and time again because at the start of the game 
the pieces are always in the same place. A selection of opening 
gambits can establish you with a strong position in the game, from 
which point you can push home your advantage.
The later stages are trickier to practise as games rarely follow a 
similar pattern, but enough games ought to help you recognise 
situations and remember what went well before and what didn’t. 
Ways of improving your play include playing without a queen 
so you are not reliant on it, or slashing the time in which you get 
to make your move so you are forced to think more quickly. This 
means in competitive games you would be able to deal with the 
loss of your queen or feel like you have much more time to think 
about your next move.
Ultimately, in order to get very good at chess, you will need to 
push yourself out of your comfort zone. Handicapping yourself 
might be frustrating, but it will teach you how to deal with 
gameplay situations and should ensure you won’t make rash 
decisions during a game if you suffer a setback, since you’ve 
already prepared for it.
Chess is almost unique in sport and games in that it is 
spectacularly unlikely that after a few dozen moves you will be in 
a position that you have been in before, so all you can really do to 
improve your own game is become an expert at opening moves, 
blocking opposition moves and dealing with adversity.

“A chessboard is beautifully simple, 
consisting of 64 alternating light 
and dark squares”
Chess for Beginners  19

20  Chess for Beginners
Setting up
A 
chessboard is beautifully simple. Consisting of 64 
alternating light and dark squares, it provides players with 
an easy-to-understand board on which to play a game 
that can often get rather complicated and competitive! 
A chessboard is usually made of wood or vinyl, although there 
are many different variants, and its light and dark squares are 
always arranged in eight rows of eight. These squares can often 
be made of contrasting types of wood, or even be completely 
different colours to the traditional black and white, but they will 
always be clearly defined as ‘light’ and ‘dark’. The small squares 
are all the same size, creating one larger square chessboard that 
is easily recognisable the world over. Chessboards can come in 
all sizes, but the internationally recognised standard as set by the 
World Chess Federation (FIDE) is that the small squares that make 
up the board ought to have sides measuring 5-6.5cm, and that the 
board should be rigid. 
Folding chessboards are useful for storage, but since a game of 
chess can often go on for a long time (the longest recorded game 
lasted over 20 hours), a rigid board allows players to leave the 
game and come back to it with ease. 
About the 
chessboard
On your journey to becoming a chess Grandmaster, your first stop 
is to get to know the game’s famous chequerboard platform 
 
Top tip
Which way is up?
To figure out the ‘top’ and 
‘bottom’ of a seemingly uniform 
board, first make sure that the 
‘white square is on the right’, as 
shown in the diagram on page 
21. The player that is using the 
white chess pieces is playing 
from the ‘bottom’ of 
the board.

1 White on the right
For the board to be set up correctly, 
the square on the bottom-right 
facing each player should be white. 
Remember this with the phrase 
‘white on the right’. 
5 Rank labels
Each of the Ranks found on the 
chessboard is labelled using the 
numbers 1 to 8. This starts from 1 
at the very bottom of board and 
then goes upwards.
2 Ranks
The horizontal rows of squares 
that run across a chessboard are 
known as ranks. There are eight 
of these on the board, each with 
eight squares.
6 File labels
Each file is labelled with letters 
from A to H, left to right. Each 
square on the chessboard can 
now be identified by rank and file 
(eg h6), like reading a map.
3 Files
The vertical columns of squares 
that run down the chessboard 
are known as files. There are eight 
squares in each file, and eight files 
on the board.
7 Diagonals
The lines of squares that can 
be seen criss-crossing over the 
chessboard are simply known as 
‘diagonals’. These contain squares 
all of the same colour.
4 Types of board
The dark and light squares on a 
chessboard may vary in colour. 
Some may be made of different 
types of wood, or might be 
printed onto a plastic board.
8 Size of squares
The size of the squares on a 
chessboard may differ from 
board to board, but they are 
usually twice the diameter of a 
pawn’s base.

“In the 
middlegame, 
the king is 
merely an extra, 
but in the endgame, he 
is one of the star actors”
Aaron Nimzowitsch
O
f all the pieces on the chessboard, the king could 
be considered the most important. It is the piece 
that needs to be kept safe at all costs, can never be 
captured and if it is placed in irreparable danger then the whole 
game is lost. 
However, the king could also be seen as the most useless 
piece. Its numerical value is 0, because it cannot be traded for 
any other chess pieces. But in terms of movement, the king 
could be ranked about 3.5, as it can move one square in any 
direction. If there are rival pieces sitting on the squares, the king 
can capture them. 
The king cannot move onto a square that puts it in danger 
and if it is threatened by the opponent’s pieces (known as 
check), it is up to the other chess pieces to protect the king. For 
example, if the white queen has moved into a spot that directly 
threatens the black king, this is check, and the black player has 
three options. The first is to move the king out of harm’s way; 
however, the black player must first assess if this move is safe, 
because the king cannot move itself into danger. Moving the 
black king out of the path of the white queen may place it in 
the path of another white piece.
The second option in this situation is to move another black 
piece into the path of the white queen in order to shield the 
black king. However, this risks capture for the black piece by 
the white queen, which will once again put the black king in 
danger after the capture.
The third option is to play a black chess piece to capture the 
white queen and remove the threat to the black king. It’s up 
to the player to devise a strategy and weigh up his options on 
how to guide the king to safety!

The king’s movements 
KINGS SIDE BY SIDE?
Understand the reasoning 
behind this illegal move
Given that the king can capture its 
opponent’s pieces that are occupying 
spaces on the chessboard directly 
around it (remember that the king can 
only move one square in any direction) 
yet not threatening it, this means that 
one king may not stand directly next to 
the opponent’s king on the chessboard. 
This move is not allowed according 
to the rules of chess because a player 
cannot move his king into a position 
where it could be captured. Therefore 
both kings would be in danger if they 
were standing side by side, since kings 
can capture other chess pieces that are 
directly next to them.

T
he queen is the most valuable chess piece on the board. 
It can move to any unoccupied square and travel for any 
number of squares up, down, side to side and diagonally 
across the board – combining the movement capabilities of both 
the rook and the bishop pieces. Because of its ease of movement, 
the queen is able to transfer its power across the chessboard in 
one strong movement, whereas bishops and rooks may need to 
use two to cover the same distance. The queen can also take any 
opposing pieces in its path.
Because it is able to cover all 64 squares of the board, the 
queen has a value of 9 points – the highest possible. This is equal 
to the values of one bishop, one rook and one pawn combined. 
With this in mind, you can see why it’s almost always a bad idea 
to exchange your queen for anything other than the queen of 
your opponent. However, there are some games that will play to 
forfeit a queen. Although this is a risky manoeuvre, sometimes 
this may be what it takes to win the game – it’s all in the strategy! 
Believe it or not, it is also possible to double the power of 
your queen. If a player’s pawn is able to reach the furthest rank 
away from its starting position, it is able to become any chess 
piece of the player’s choosing, known as ‘pawn promotion’. Due 
to the value of the queen, this is the most usual choice and so 
it is possible for a player to have two queens playing on the 
chessboard at a time. 
The queen
Powerful and mighty, the queen  
rules the chessboard. Here you’ll learn  
the wisest way to wield it

When you reach the other side

R
ooks, sometimes referred to as castles, are known as 
‘major pieces’ and are stronger than bishops or knights. 
Every chess game starts with four rooks on the board, 
two for each player. Each of these rooks has a value of 5 points, 
making them second only to the queen (valued at 9 points) 
when it comes to manoeuvrability and power. Rooks can move 
both forwards and backwards, but may only go in one direction 
in a given move. 
Rooks can cruise their way across the chessboard over any 
number of squares as necessary, either horizontally or vertically. 
This means that they always have the potential to attack 14 
squares, which is over 20 per cent of the chessboard! 
However, rooks cannot jump over pieces and cannot turn 
corners, which provides some limitation. Their movement is 
impeded by other pieces around them on the board (of both 
friendly and opposing sides), but they can capture chess pieces of 
the opponent if need be. 
If two rooks from the same side are both on the same file 
(vertical squares) or rank (horizontal squares), they support one 
another and are known as ‘doubled rooks’.
The rooks sit behind the pawns to begin the game and 
so, because of this, they are more powerful at the endgame 
(chess-speak for ‘the end of the game’), when the board is 
unencumbered by so many other chess pieces from both sides. 
Rooks work best on open files or open ranks. 
The rook
The rook is the second most powerful 
piece to play on the chessboard. Read on 
to find out why, and how to use them

ABOUT CASTLING
An unusual move involving a 
rook and the king
Castling is the only move in chess where 
two pieces are moved at once, and it 
involves a rook and the king moving to 
effectively switch places. This has the 
advantage of putting the king in a safer 
position, while getting the rook into 
action at the centre of the board. 
To make the move, the king moves 
two squares towards a rook and then 
the rook moves to the square on the 
opposite side of the one the king now 
sits on. You can’t perform castling if your 
king or rook has already been moved, 
the king is in check or will be when it 
castles, or if there are any chess pieces in 
between the king and the rook.

T
here are four bishops in a game of chess, two for each 
player. Bishops of each side start off on a white and a 
black square, flanking the king and queen. They can 
be differentiated by where they begin on the chessboard; for 
example, the bishop that begins the game next to the queen is 
known as the ‘queen’s bishop’ and the one beginning next to 
the king is known as the ‘king’s bishop’. These pieces can emulate 
the diagonal movement of the queen but not the horizontal or 
vertical movement of the rooks. 
Bishops can move both forward and backward on their 
diagonal lines, and have to stay on the colour that they started 
on. So, the white bishop that begins on a white square can 
only move on the diagonal lines of the white squares on the 
chessboard. Similarly, the white bishop that starts on the black 
square can only move on the diagonal black squares of the 
chessboard. The same applies to the black bishops.
These chess pieces have a value of 3 points, equal to three 
pawns or one knight, and can control up to 13 squares on the 
board at a time. They cannot jump over pieces, and their path 
must be clear in order to move. Bishops capture in much the 
same way as they move – they can take a chess piece of the 
opposing side that stands in their path, and must replace the 
piece on that square once the capture has been made.
A lot like rooks, bishops are often most useful in the endgame, 
where the board is clearer of other chess pieces and the bishops 
are able to command the diagonals and be put to best use.
The bishop
On these pages you’ll get to learn the bare 
bishop basics, and how to use the masters

GOOD BISHOPS 
AND BAD BISHOPS
Learn how to make your 
bishops work for you
Bishops can be used alongside other 
pieces to get the best out of them. A 
bishop that is working well with pawns 
is called a ‘good bishop’. For example, if 
the bishop is occupying a white square 
and most of the pawns are occupying 
the black squares, this is advantageous 
as the bishop has more freedom to move 
and can control the squares that its allied 
pawns can’t. A ‘bad bishop’ generally 
occupies the same colour squares as the 
surrounding pawns, which can trap it. 
Although this is not seen as ideal, there 
are advantages, as the  bishop and the 
pawns may defend one another.

K
nights are some of the more tricky characters to 
master on the chessboard. Often depicted as figures 
of horses or horses’ heads, they are the only pieces that 
can jump over other pieces (friendly or opposing) and their 
movement is also less straightforward than the other pieces. 
With a value of 3 points, equalling the worth of a bishop, 
knights are often thought of as less valuable pieces, but their 
value all depends on how you play them. Knights can move 
in an L-shaped pattern, by either moving one square to the 
side and then two squares up or down, or two squares to 
the side and then one square up or down. They can move in 
any direction, as long as they follow this L-shaped rule and as 
long as their ‘landing’ square is free. If the ‘landing’ square is 
occupied by a friendly chess piece, the knight may not move 
to that square, but if it’s occupied by an opponent’s chess 
piece, the knight may capture it, if it so wishes, and replace 
that piece on the square. This L-shaped pattern means that 
knights always land on a square of a different colour to the 
one on which they started, so if a knight started its L-shaped 
move on a white square, it will always land on a black square 
and vice versa. 
Unlike rooks or bishops, knights come into their own when 
used in areas of the board that are densely packed with chess 
pieces. They are also the only piece on the board that can 
move at the beginning of the game without first moving a 
pawn out of the way.

ach player starts off with eight pawns, all lined up on the 
player’s second rank in front of the other chess pieces. 
Each pawn has a value of 1 point. A pawn can only move 
one square forwards at any one time, except their very first move 
where a player has the option of moving a pawn two squares 
forwards. They cannot move backwards or sideways, nor can they 
jump over other pieces, and if their path is blocked by another 
piece – friendly or opposing – they cannot move. 
Another interesting thing about pawns is how they capture, 
since they are the only chess pieces that capture differently to 
how they move. Pawns can take their opponent’s pieces on a 
diagonal, going forwards. They then replace that piece on the 
square where it stood.  
Pawns have one trick associated with capturing that is known 
as ‘en passant’. This is where, for example, a black pawn has just 
made his first move of two squares, next to him is a white pawn. 
The white pawn can capture the black one diagonally, even 
though the black pawn isn’t on the diagonal square, but directly 
next to the white pawn. This can only happen immediately after 
the black pawn moves. See step 3 for a diagram of this rule. 
Pawns are, in fact, all potential queens. If a pawn makes it to the 
furthest rank from where they started, pawns can be promoted. 
They can become any type of chess piece apart from a king. 
Because the queen is so powerful, many pawns are promoted to 
this piece. In fact, if a pawn is promoted to anything other than a 
queen, this is known as ‘underpromotion’.
The pawn
Each opponent has eight of these little 
guys to play with, and there’s more to 
them than meets the eye

can be rescued by moving 
or by another piece.  
Checkmate is where 
the king is in irreparable 
danger, and ends the 
game. Stalemate is usually 
a draw, when no pieces 
can make legal moves.

Files and 
ranks
The board is 
divided up into files 
(vertical columns of 
squares) and ranks 
(horizontal rows). These 
are numbered and 
lettered, beginning from 
the bottom-left corner, 
so each square has a 
unique location.

Value 
of the 
pieces
Each piece has a relative 
value, so you can weigh 
up whether they are 
worth trading for your 
opponent’s pieces. The 
queen has the highest 
value of 9, knights and 
bishops 3, rooks 5, 
pawns 1 and the king 0. 
3 
Pawns 
capture 
diagonally
Unlike any of other piece 
type, pawns capture other 
pieces in a different way to 
how they move: diagonally 
in a forward motion. The 
pawn can then replace 
the captured piece on the 
square and resume normal 
forward movement.
4 
Queen can 
go where 
it pleases
Remember that your queen 
is the most powerful piece 
on the board! It can move 
anywhere in a forward, 
backward, side-to-side or 
diagonal motion. However, 
the queen can’t jump 
over things, and it can’t 
turn corners.

Keep the 
king safe
The king is able 
to move one square 
in any direction, but it 
can never be placed in 
danger. So it’s considered 
illegal to move your 
king onto a square that 
is under threat from 
another chess piece and 
so put itself into check.

Knights 
are 
jumpers
Knights in chess have 
the unique capability to 
jump over other chess 
pieces. Knights move in 
an L-shape, and as long as 
there is no friendly piece 
on their ‘landing’ square, 
they can jump over as 
many as they like.

To save any kind 
of flapping about by 
tossing a coin or drawing 
straws to decide who 
begins the game, the

and simple answer. The 
player with the white 
chess pieces always takes 
the first move.

Aim of 
the game
The objective of 
chess is to strategically 
work your chess pieces 
across the board with 
a view to capturing the 
enemy king. If either side 
manages to checkmate 
their opponent, that 
player wins and the game 
is over.

irst of all, don’t be scared by the 
name: algebraic notation is a very 
simple and easy-to-understand 
method of writing chess moves down. 
It’s used for documenting games in 
tournaments and is the best way of 
describing how to play chess in books, 
magazines and online and is the method 
recognised by the World Chess Federation 
(FIDE). As chess is a physical game, it’s 
useful to be able to write down the moves 
made by each player in shorthand, instead 
of having to write ‘white queen moves 
to the third square from the left on the 
second row and captures a black pawn’.
This method of documentation uses 
lower-case letters and numbers to denote 
the individual squares on a chessboard, 
so each location on the board is easy to 
pinpoint. Capital letters are used to denote 
the chess pieces, while other symbols such 
as an ‘x’ or a ‘+’ or a ‘#’ stand for moves 
such as captures and check or checkmate. 
The notation is written in two columns, 
one for white and one for black. In a 
tournament, each player must note down 
his or her move. The moves are numbered 
for each player, so it’s easy to see how to 
game progresses by looking through the 
notations in order. It might look a little bit 
confusing at first, but once you get the 
hang of what letters relate to what pieces, 
and how each square on the chessboard is 
identified, you’ll soon pick it up. 
Here we’ll show you what each symbol 
means, how a game is put together using 
algebraic notation and how to read it 
and apply the moves to a chessboard. 
Before you know it you’ll be able to note 
down all your killer moves on your way to 
becoming a true Grandmaster!

Know your pawns
Unlike the other pieces, pawns 
aren’t denoted by a capital 
letter. When you see d2-d4 
instead of Qd2-d4, for instance, 
you know that the absence of 
a capital letter means  
a pawn makes  
this move.
“Before you know it you’ll be able 
to note down all your killer moves”
01: Places on the board Ranks are labelled 1-8 
and files a-h. Quite like the grid on a map, using these gives each 
square a unique code. The queen here is at e5.
02: Notation symbols This is a list of symbols that 
are used in algebraic notation. Capital letters for chess pieces, ‘x’

T
he initial moves between the two players in a chess 
game are known as the opening. Within just the first 
few moves of a game, the number of available moves and 
positions are immeasurable. Over the years, many combinations  
of opening moves have been studied in order to find the best 
way to open a match. There are hundreds of recognised opening 
variants that have their own names. Over time, some of these 
sequences have proved more popular and successful than others. 
The thing to bear in mind with chess is that each side is equally 
matched. It’s not about who has the better team, it’s about how 
you open the match and how your opponent responds to your 
moves. A game of chess consists of three stages: the opening, the 
middlegame and the endgame. Ultimately, a good opening can 
serve a number of purposes. It can get your pieces mobilised on 
useful squares (known as developing) so they can have an impact 
on the game. There is also the possibility of controlling the centre 
of the board – particularly squares e4, d4, e5 and d5 – which for 
some players is seen as a good way of limiting your opponent’s 
mobility. A good opening can also determine how well protected 
your king will be from attack.
Openings
The way you start your chess game is hugely 
important. Take time to learn some opening patterns 
to improve your gameplay
Top tip
Knights first
Some players suggest 
developing knights first as they 
are more effective if in the centre 
of the board. While getting them 
into position, your opponent’s 
responses may suggest  
where to place  
future pieces.

The Italian Game
OFFENCE:  
Perhaps one of 
the oldest chess 
openings, the Italian 
Game is still used 
today at various 
levels of play. To 
start, white pawn(1) 
moves to e4, 
followed by black 
pawn(2) to e5. White 
knight(3) then moves 
to f3; this move puts 
the black pawn 
under threat.
DEFENCE: Black 
mirrors with its 
knight(1) by moving 
to c6 (to protect 
the exposed black 
pawn). White can 
then move its 
bishop(2) to c4. 
Now the black 
pawn at f7 is weak. 
The Italian Game 
is known to lead 
to open positions 
and aggressive 
gameplay.
Open Game
OFFENCE: An 
Open Game (or 
Double King’s Pawn 
Opening) is a chess 
game where white 
starts by moving 
its pawn to e4. 
It’s a very popular 
opening move as 
it immediately lays 
down a claim on 
the centre spaces. 
It also frees the 
bishop and queen 
for future play.

DEFENCE: Black 
may choose to 
respond to this 
opening move in 
a similar fashion by 
moving its pawn  
to e5. At this point 
we have what 
is known as an 
Open Game. From 
here the game 
can evolve into a 
large number of 
established Open 
Game procedures.
French Defence
OFFENCE: The 
French Defence 
involves black 
conceding some 
centre space to 
white. In return, 
it prevents the 
potential damage 
that white’s bishop 
could cause in the 
Italian Game. White 
pawn(1) moves to 
e4; black pawn(2) 
responds by 
moving to e6. 
DEFENCE: 
Typically, white may 
move its pawn(1) 
to d4 to build 
up a defence. In 
response, black can 
move its opposing 
pawn(2) to d5. This 
presents a number 
of choices for 
white’s pawn as to 
whether it takes the 
black pawn. Doing 
so puts its own 
pawn at risk.
Here we take a look at three of the most popular openings in chess, each of which will have a great 
influence on how the game develops

01: Opening moves The Ruy Lopez starts with the 
white pawn(1) moving to e4. In a mirrored response to white, the 
black pawn(2) moves to e5.
02: Knights to move white now ‘develops’ his 
knight(1) by moving it to f3. This puts a threat on the black pawn. 
Black knight(2) moves to b6 to provide a defence for the pawn.
One of the most popular openings within the game of chess, 
Ruy Lopez is over 500 years old
Ruy Lopez
Ruy Lopez is one of the most recognised 
and popular openings in chess. Originally 
it was part of a study of various openings 
by Ruy López de Segura in 1561. Despite 
bearing his name, the opening was also 
included in the Göttingen manuscript. 
This is the earliest known work devoted 
to modern chess and dates back to 1490. 
It wasn’t until the mid-19th century that 
the Ruy Lopez gained popularity when 
Finnish/Russian chess player Carl Jaenisch 
‘rediscovered’ its potential. The Ruy Lopez 
has remained a commonly used opening, 
adopted by many players. It is popular as it 
allows white players to have a prolonged 
battle for the initiative. 
The opening moves of the Ruy Lopez 
provide for a tight, tactical flow of play 
where pieces are constantly being placed 
under threat. Indeed, the theory behind 
it is the most extensively developed of all 
open games. With each move there are 
various alternatives to choose from and 
many of these are seen as reasonable 
moves to make. 
Top tip
Ruy Lopez  
familiarity
If playing a new opponent, 
watch them carefully if you 
open with Ruy Lopez. An 
experienced player may be 
familiar with it and have a 
specific defence  
at the ready.

05: White retreats With the attacking white bishop(1) 
now under attack, it is normal for it to make a retreat. A common 
move at this juncture is for it to move to a4.
06: Berlin Defence As an alternative to step 4, black 
could also move knight(1) to f6. This puts the pawn under threat. 
Following white’s move, the black knight can move to d6.
03: Bishop steps out The white bishop(1) can now 
move to b5. This has pinned down the developed black knight at 
c6. It also opens up a castle opportunity for the white king.
04: Black defends From here a common defence is 
for black to move pawn to a6, putting the bishop under threat. 
This is a popular move and is known as the Morphy Defence.

is normal for it to make a retreat”

03: White pawn moves You need to watch what 
white does next. If they make the other pawn(1) move from step 1 
(in this case from f3 to f2), you’re ready to strike.
04: Check and mate This is where black strikes. 
White has left a channel to their king wide open. Black can now 
move their queen(1) to h4. The white king is trapped. Checkmate! 
01: White opens The game begins with white 
moving either their pawn(1) from f3 to f2, or moving the g2 pawn 
to g4 (pictured). This will help open a line that exposes the king.
02: Black responds If you’re playing black and white 
opens in this way, you can respond by moving your pawn(2) from 
e7 to e5. This will allow your queen to push out shortly.
Fool’s mate is the quickest possible checkmate in a game of chess. It is also known as the ‘Two-Move 
Checkmate’. It occurs when white makes the error of exposing the king very quickly

5 White pawn advance
White can, however, move its 
d2 pawn forward. Thanks to the 
positioning of the knight at f3, 
the white pawn has protection 
when moving to d4.
1 E4 opening
The game starts with the popular 
white move of pawn to e4. It’s 
an aggressive move with an 
immediate claim for the centre of 
the board.
6 Black pawn takes white
It’s likely that black will look to take 
the pawn at d4. While this puts the 
pawn at risk, the upshot is clearing 
the white pawn defence on the 
queen’s line. 
2 Black’s response
With the Sicilian Defence, black 
moves pawn to c5. It’s a move that 
covers the d4 square, preventing 
white from also claiming that 
space immediately. 
7 Black knight advances
The black knight can now 
move forward to f6. This puts 
immediate pressure on the pawn 
at e4. It is now something of an 
unwanted obstacle for white.
3 White knight develops
A common move now is for white 
to develop his knight. The knight 
can hop over other pieces, so no 
time is wasted with making room 
for it to move.
8 The state of play
At this point, the game has an 
interesting balance. White has 
more development available but 
is exposed centrally. Black has a 
stronger central pawn majority.
4 Black pushes defence
bBack is likely looking to keep 
white’s advances at bay. It can 
move its queen pawn to d6. The 
white pawn at e4 now cannot 
move without being taken.

01: The pawns When making their first move, pawns(1) 
can either move one space or two. In the opening, it is important 
to move the right pawns to allow other pieces to develop. 
02: Knights It is said that it is best to get your minor 
pieces out early in the game. Developing knights(1) before bishops 
is generally seen as a good approach.
The way you deploy your pieces during the opening may determine your options further down the 
line. Learning how to apply the right piece in the right location can make all the difference
The role of each piece
There are many schools of thought with 
regards to opening. If you research what 
methods are best you’ll generally find a 
few common threads. One such example 
is controlling the centre of the board. 
Getting your pieces towards the centre 
of the board can give a more controlling 
reach over the board. As a result, you can 
find that you may have a greater ability 
to dictate the progress of the match than 
your opponent. To this extent, pawns 
can be handy to have on e4, e5, d4 or d5 
(depending on your colour).
As mentioned previously, it is also 
seen as important to ‘develop’ your 
pieces such as the knight and the bishop 
(for a number of players, this is also the 
recommended order). While the opening 
is in progress, it is also seen as a waste 
to move a piece more than once in your 
first ten moves. The idea of getting more 
pieces developed is that it restricts the 
available squares to your opponent. By 
moving a piece twice, you may lose a 
chance to develop another piece.

05: The queen The most powerful piece, the queen(1) 
should take a back seat in the opening stages the. It doesn’t need 
to develop straight away and put itself at unnecessary risk. 
06: The king During your opening you may wish 
to ‘castle’ your king(1). This helps to place it in a safer position, 
although the process is subject to various rules.
04: Rooks Rooks(1) are powerful but are not so involved 
within the opening due to how they are blocked in by other 
pieces. As with bishops, it’s good to get them into clear lines.

48  Chess for Beginners
I
n a game of chess, the ultimate goal is to trap the enemy’s 
king whilst defending your own king from checkmate. In the 
process of this happening, each player will have the opportunity 
to capture pieces that belong to the other player. This occurs 
when a piece is able to land on a space that is already occupied 
by another piece on the opposing side. When this happens, the 
enemy piece is deemed as captured and then removed from 
the chessboard. Each piece has its own methods and strengths 
regarding capturing. Part of winning a match is weakening your 
opponent’s forces as more pieces are captured. By that token, 
being able to avoid capture will also help the strength of your 
position as you play. 
There are varying kinds of capture; some may involve a ‘safe’ 
capture where the target piece is not within range of any pieces 
on the same team. As a result, an attacking piece will not be 
exposed to any danger once they have completed their turn. 
Conversely, there may be a time when making a capture will 
put the attacking piece at risk. At those moments, it’s worth 
considering whether capturing a piece is worth the sacrifice that 
may follow afterwards. 
Capturing 
pieces
Capturing enemy pieces is important, but knowing how and 
when to capture them is a key component to victory 
Top tip
Look before  
leaping
A key factor of chess is being 
aware of your opponent’s pieces. 
What was their last move? Where 
could they progress? Before 
rushing into a capture, ensure 
you’re not leaving any other 
pieces exposed.

Pawn
The pawn is unique 
among the pieces 
in that it performs a different 
capture move compared to 
how it normally moves. A pawn 
would normally move straight 
forward but when capturing 
another piece, the pawn will 
actually move forward in a 
diagonal direction to take 
it. This can cause problems, 
however, since your line of 
defence can become broken 
or leave you with two pawns in 
one file.

Knight
The knight is capable 
of something that 
other pieces cannot 
do– it can jump 
over other pieces as it moves. 
As shown in the diagram, it is 
most powerful when nearer 
the centre of the board (where 
it can reach any of the black 
pawns). Here the knight is  
able to capture two different 
pawns, however, if it took d4 
then the e5 would be able to 
do then take the knight on its 
next move.

Bishop
The bishop has 
no restriction 
upon how far it 
can travel in each 
move. It is limited to purely 
diagonal movement, however, 
and cannot leap over other 
pieces. Bishops become 
more powerful towards the 
endgame, when their reach 
gives them more lines on which 
to operate. To take, they must 
have a clear run to the piece 
and be able to land on the 
square with their movement.
On this page and the next, we detail the ways in which the six different chess piece types capture 
opposing pieces on the board

50  Chess for Beginners
Rook
The rook is regarded 
as a valuable piece 
in chess. Towards 
the beginning of the game, 
the rooks are largely penned 
into their corners, but by the 
endgame, however, they 
really come into their own 
thanks to their reach across 
the board. They are also very 
powerful pieces for setting up 
checkmates. Like bishops, to 
take, they must have a clear run 
to the piece and be able to land 
on the square on their go.
Queen
The queen is a very 
powerful piece and 
is ranked as the most 
valuable on the 
board. It can move 
any number of squares in any 
direction. It must be able to 
immediately land on a piece  
to take and cannot jump  
pieces. It can sometimes be 
used as a means to lure an 
opponent into a trap. It also 
plays a vital role in Scholar’s 
Mate where it combines with 
the bishop to attack. 
King
The most important 
piece in the game 
and yet for the  
most part it is also 
the weakest piece 
on the board.  
Both kings start on the rear  
rank and movements are  
limited to one space, so can  
only take when a piece is 
directly next to it. In the 
endgame, however, the king 
can play a role as an offensive 
piece or for defending a pawn 
on its way to promotion.

03: Pawn captured In reality the White pawn is not 
safe. The Black pawn(1) can advance as if the White pawn had only 
moved one space. The White pawn is treated as captured.
04: Instant play The en passant must be played as 
soon as it is possible or the right to do so is lost. It’s the only time 
a piece is captured but its position is not replaced on the board.
01: On approach In this example a Black pawn(1) has 
advanced to b4. This puts it within range of the pawns along 
rows a and b, which are yet to move from starting positions.
02: White advances The White pawn(1) has 
advanced two spaces to a4. Some players new to the game of 
chess may mistakenly assume that the White pawn is safe. 
The ‘en passant’ is a special move involving pawns and their ability to move two spaces on their 
initial move. Despite moving two spaces, a pawn can be taken as if it had only moved one

52  Chess for Beginners
Playing the game
I
f you’re not familiar with chess, it’s still likely that you’ve heard 
the terms ‘check’ and ‘checkmate’. When playing chess, they 
are the two words that you will want to find yourself saying (as 
opposed to having them said to you). While sounding similar, they 
have quite different meanings. 
‘Check’ refers to a point in the game when the king is under 
threat from an opposing piece but is able to escape from danger. 
At this point, the player with the threatened king must take action 
to make the king safe. They are not allowed to ignore the threat 
and carry on playing as normal. There can be various benefits to 
performing a check on an opposing player. If used correctly, check 
can be applied as a useful tactic in attack or defence. It can force 
an opposing player to move their king when they do not wish to. 
It can also take them away from formulating their own strategies. 
While in check, it is also not possible for your opponent to castle 
their king. With the right setup, it could also form part of a two-
pronged attack where a player is forced to move their king rather 
than look to protect another piece on the board. 
Check and 
checkmate
The aim of the game is to trap the king. Depending on your 
success, you will have performed a check or a checkmate 
Top tip
Learn them
Try to learn as many reliable 
checkmate strategies as you 
can. You’ll then be more likely 
to be able to set them up or 
spot when your opponent 
uses them.

Capture
IN CHECK: The 
Black knight at f5 
has the white king 
in check. On some 
occasions a piece 
can block the line 
of fire. This is not 
possible, however, 
when a knight is 
presenting the 
check (as it can 
jump pieces). As 
a result, the white 
pawn at f3 is not 
able to block.

OUT OF CHECK: 
The king can’t 
move to safety. The 
black queen has 
the d line covered 
while the bishops 
and knights make 
it impossible for 
the king to move. 
The white bishop(1), 
however, can move 
from b1 to f5. In the 
process, the black 
knight is removed 
from play.
Move to safety
IN CHECK: The 
king is currently 
under threat from 
the black bishop on 
g5. It has a direct 
line to the king. 
The position of the 
king on the board 
means that the 
opposing pieces 
are out of reach and 
there are no other 
pieces on the board 
that can remove 
the bishop.

Here the choices

It’s also important 
to remember that 
when under check,

Blocking
IN CHECK: The 
black bishop has 
pushed forward to 
b4 and placed the 
white king in check. 
The white king is 
mostly pinned in 
by its surrounding 
pieces, which 
limits movement.

not free it from 
the bishop’s line

OUT OF CHECK: 
You could use the 
white queen or 
bishop to block 
the black bishop, 
but this would put 
those pieces at 
risk. By placing the 
white pawn(1) on c3, 
the black bishop 
is blocked. Should 
it choose to take 
the pawn, it risks 
getting captured by 
the pawn at b2. 
If you’re opponent calls ‘check’, don’t panic! Here we take a look at some common check situations 
and how to tackle them

54  Chess for Beginners
Playing the game
03: Double check This is when a piece makes a 
move on the opposing king resulting in a discovered check in the 
process. The white rook(1) moving to c5 will achieve this.
04: Cross-check This occurs when a check is answered 
by another check. Here the black bishop has the king in check. 
When the king moves, the white rook checks the black king.
01: Simple check A basic check is when a piece 
deliberately moves to place the king under threat. This piece may 
be working on its own rather than being part of a tactic.
02: Discovered check This occurs when a piece is 
moved to ‘reveal’ a check on the king (eg white pawn to g5). The 
king has to move and cannot save the black knight at d4.
There is more than one way for a check on the king to reveal itself – sometimes it can occur when a 
piece is moved out of the path of an attacker

Chess for Beginners  55
When there is no way to protect the king from an attack, it’s checkmate and the game is over, but 
setting up a checkmate isn’t usually easy
Checkmate
Checkmate is the ultimate goal of any 
chess match. It occurs when the king is 
in check and there is no way to formulate 
an escape. This means that there is no safe 
square to move to, capture the threatening 
piece or block the attack from it. In chess 
the king is never actually captured or 
removed from the board: the game 
ends as soon as a checkmate becomes 
apparent. A checkmate can be delivered 
by any piece on the board apart from the 
opposing king. This would not be possible 
as the kings would not be able to get close 
enough to each other without putting 
themselves in check. 
In professional games between 
advanced players, checkmates are less 
common. This is due to players at a higher 
level resigning before putting themselves 
in a position to suffer a checkmate. 
Getting a checkmate is not easy. If 
you’re pushing an offensive front to obtain 
checkmate, it’s important not to leave your 
own king unguarded. It’s also important 
that when going for a checkmate you do 
not end up chasing the king around the 
board. This can lead the game into a draw 
(known as a stalemate) which is a preferred 
ending for a disadvantage player. 
Skilled players have been known to 
set up a checkmate and literally steer 
the king’s sequential moves into an 
inevitable checkmate. Part of becoming an 
experienced player is learning how to set 
up plays such as this. There are a number 
of recognised checkmate setups that, once 
studied, can help to boost your repertoire 
for your future chess matches. Some 
involve trapping the king in a tight space; 
others have two pieces forcing pressure in 
order to secure victory.

or removed from the board”

03: Smothered A smothered checkmate is delivered 
by a knight where the mated king is blocked by its own 
surrounding pieces. Normally these appear in the board corners.
04: Morphy’s mate Named after US master Paul 
Morphy, this involves the bishop and rook working together to 
trap the king. Here the white bishop can force checkmate.
01: Back-rank mate This is usually delivered by the 
rook or queen along a back rank (ie the far row). The king cannot 
move forward as it is blocked by its own pieces.
02: Support checkmate There are checkmates 
where the queen is supported by a minor piece. Here the queen 
has moved to e6 to trap the king, while protected by the knight.
There are various ways of setting up a checkmate position to win the game. Here we take a look at 
some of the more common types

01: Scholar’s mate Also known as the ‘four-move 
checkmate’, the Scholar’s mate combines the queen and bishop 
to attack on f7 and checkmate in the process. To begin with, both 
white(1) and black(2) move their e pawns out two spaces to meet 
in the centre of the board.
03: Queen advances The white queen now moves 
out to h5. It’s the beginning of the end! The white queen(1) is now 
along a diagonal line with both the pawn at f7 along with the 
king directly behind it. Not sensing the attack on the f7 square, 
black is likely to move his knight(2) to f6 to threaten the queen. 
02: Bishop advances White’s initial move has 
opened up room for the queen and bishop to advance. Firstly, 
the bishop(1) moves to c4. This puts it on a diagonal line straight 
to the pawn at f7 but out of reach of black. Sensing the bishop 
threat, black would likely develop his knight(2) to c6.
04: Checkmate The black knight’s threat on the white 
queen(1) is no good – it can happily advance to f7 and take the 
pawn. The king behind it is now under threat as a result. It cannot 
move to e7 nor can it capture the queen thanks to the white 
bishop offering protection all the way from c4. 
Defensive mistakes can bring a quick end to the game in this situation, so pay attention if you don’t 
want to get caught out by it

58  Chess for Beginners
W
hen playing chess, you may 
think that it’s generally a 
good idea to capture as many 
opposing pieces as you can. In fact, 
sometimes it can be more beneficial to 
sacrifice a piece in order to achieve an 
upper hand. For example, you may wish to 
gain an advantageous position early in the 
game. In chess this is known as a gambit. 
In most cases it is a pawn that is the 
sacrificed piece and white that starts the 
gambit. When black initiates a gambit, it is 
sometimes known as a ‘countergambit’. 
When a gambit is in play, it is said to 
be ‘offered’ to the opponent, at which 
point it is either ‘accepted’ or ‘declined’. It 
is not a formal declaration as such, nor is it 
announced. It’s simply a matter of whether 
the opposing player chooses to take the 
bait. If the offered player captures the 
piece, the gambit is termed as accepted. 
On the other hand, if the offered player 
chooses to ignore the gambit in favour of 
continuing their own objectives, then the 
gambit is termed as declined. 
There are many gambits that can be 
played and each has multiple variations 
therein. Some are said to be more ‘sound’ 
than others. In real terms this means 
whether they will give the offering 
player opportunity to place pieces in 
areas of the board that would otherwise 
be inaccessible. That and whether the 
accepting player suffers from a loss such as 
a decentralising of their pieces. 
In general, most gambits occur within 
the first five to ten moves of a chess game. 
If used right, they can be fun to employ as 
they throw a curveball into proceedings 
while stepping up the speed and intensity 
of a game. 
Learn how to apply riskier plays and sacrifices in  
order to throw off your opponent and gain a more 
advantageous position
Top tip
An ulterior motive
Take care not to be on the 
receiving end of a gambit. You 
may well be tempted to take 
a pawn during the opening of 
a game, but be aware of what 
piece you are moving and  
what is left exposed  
once it moves. 
“They can be fun to employ as they 
throw a curveball into proceedings”
01: The Queen’s Gambit This is said to be a very 
sound gambit. White opens by moving their pawn(1) to d4. Black 
responds in similar fashion by moving their pawn(2) to d5.
02: Set the gambit White now sets the gambit in 
play by moving their white pawn(1) to c4. By doing this they are 
offering black a chance to capture the pawn by moving to c4.

60  Chess for Beginners
Playing the game
A 
sacrifice is when a player gives 
up a piece for the opponent 
to capture. It is done with the 
intention of gaining some kind of 
compensation. This can take the form of a 
tactical or position-based advantage which 
may occur later in the game. A sacrifice can 
happen at any point, while gambits tend 
to occur during the opening. Any chess 
piece except the king can be sacrificed. 
Creating a sacrifice can serve as a 
psychological ploy that may unsettle your 
opponent. Ideally a player would look 
to hold onto their pieces for as long as 
possible. The offer of a sacrifice can throw 
an opponent off balance while they try to 
decide whether to act upon it or not. 
There are two main types of sacrifice: 
real and sham. There are also further 
variations within these two main 
definitions. A real sacrifice involves the 
sacrificing player continuing on with 
fewer pieces than his opponents for 
a measurable length of time. This can 
provide a psychological boost for the 
sacrificing player. They may feel that they 
are taking control of the game while their 
opponent is not entirely sure what is going 
on. In a sham sacrifice, the sacrificing player 
will gain their compensation in a much 
shorter number of moves. It is also known 
as a pseudo sacrifice. 
There are forced and non-forced 
sacrifices. The former leaves the opponent 
with little option but to accept for fear 
of being left behind in the game if they 
don’t do so. Non-forced sacrifices offer the 
opponent a choice. Of course, it’s down 
to the opponent to figure out if they can 
accept or decline a sacrifice without paying 
for it in the long run. 
Whilst keeping your pieces seems all well  
and good, sometimes it pays to sacrifice something  
in order to gain an advantage
Top tip
Sacrifice or  
blunder?
When faced with a sacrifice, 
don’t forget there is also the 
possibility that it is a blunder – 
these are generally moves that 
accidentally reveal some  
kind of tactical  
oversight. 
“It can serve as a psychological ploy 
that may unsettle your opponent”
01: Classic bishop sacrifice This starts with 
white bishop at d3. It needs black to have castled, with a ‘fortress’ 
of black pieces that will aid capture of the king.
02: Sacrifice offered Black moves queen’s knight 
to c6 while white drives the bishop to h7. The king is now in 
check but can easily take the bishop as a sacrifice.

04: King is pinned Black moves rook(1) to e8 to give 
the king room to breathe. It’s not enough as queen(2) moves to e7. 
The king is pinned, forcing black to resign the match.

1. The queen 
offered
The white queen 
has moved up the 
board from d4 to 
d8. It is now under 
threat from the 
black rook at a8. 
Will black take  
the sacrifice?
4. Checkmate!
Sure enough, 
the white rook 
advances to 
d8 to capture 
to rook. In the 
process it creates a 
checkmate that the 
king cannot escape
3.Rook is in 
danger
By taking the 
queen, black has 
now ended up 
placing their rook 
at d8. This puts it 
directly in the firing 
line of the white 
rook at d2
2. Rook takes 
queen
In the next move, 
the rook would 
likely take the 
queen at d8. In 
other words, they 
have taken the

01: Queen sacrifice The match Lasker vs Thomas 
(1912) features a famous queen sacrifice by Edward Lasker. At this 
point, the queen is about to move to h7 to be sacrificed.
02: Forced king The king(1) is forced to move to h7 (the 
knight has f7 covered) and take the queen. The white knight(2) 
moves to f6, taking a bishop and double-checking the king.

05: No retreat Again the king(1) is forced to move. It 
reaches f3 but the white bishop(2) moves to e2, putting it in check 
again. The knights and pawn stop it retreating.
06: Black resigns The king(1) is forced to g2. The white 
rook(2) moves to h2, leaving black (Thomas) to resign. If the king 
moved to g1, white could castle for a checkmate. 
03: Checked again The king(1) is forced to h6 
(moving to h8 results in checkmate). White knight(2) responds to 
g4 to check it again. The bishop at d3 stops the king retreating.
04: Pawns advance The king(1) moves ahead to g5 
but the white pawn(2) advances to h4, putting it in check again.

n chess the pawns are seen as the 
infantry: they are the most numerous 
pieces in the game as well as the 
weakest. They are limited in movement 
and lack the reach of more important 
pieces. It is because of this perceived 
weakness that more valuable pieces would 
avoid capture by such a minor piece. A 
player would arguably move their rook, 
knight, bishop or queen to a safer square 
rather than be captured by a pawn. In 
effect this can give the pawn an element 
of strength and influence. Over the course 
of a game, the layout of your pawns (or 
‘pawn structure’) can become important. 
In general it is not possible to determine 
whether a particular pawn structure is 
good or bad, as much of it depends on 
the layout of the other pieces. While some 
recognised formations have a symmetrical 
layout along the vertical lines of e and d 
and look similar, they tend to have varying 
characteristics due to the positioning of the 
king on each side. 
As a game progresses, your pawn 
structure may develop weaknesses 
(although, as with many things with chess, 
these can be argued either way). Examples 
include isolated pawns: those without a 
friendly pawn on an adjacent square as 
protection. There are also doubled pawns, 
where two are on the same file; they can’t 
defend each other and can be a hindrance 
during an endgame. You may also end up 
with pawns that can’t advance due to lack 
of protection; these are backwards pawns.
There are a number of recognised pawn 
structures. In the following examples we 
will look solely at the pawn positioning, 
without the other pieces on the board to 
serve as distractions. 
Pawn 
structures
The humble pawn plays some important roles. Being aware 
of structure and weaknesses is key to good results
Top tip
When to advance
The pawn is the only piece 
that can’t move backwards. So, 
every move a pawn makes is 
permanent. Only look to move 
a pawn to achieve goals such as 
developing another piece  
or controlling the 
 centre.
“As a game progresses, your pawn 
structure may develop weaknesses”
01: Caro formation This has a white pawn placed at 
d4. It offers a queenside majority should black exchange it for the 
c pawn. For black, the white pawn may be a weakness.
02: Slav formation For white, this formation puts 
pressure on the c file and the weakness of the c pawn. Black can 
advance the c or e pawn if white’s formation breaks.

03: Sicilian-Scheveningen A more complex 
game. White can pressure the d file and has a space advantage. 
Black can pressure the b file and white’s pawn on e4 or e5. 
04: Sicilian-Dragon Here, white has an outpost at 
e5. Black can apply pressure via diagonal queenside counterplay 
and white’s overextended kingside pawns.
Pawn layouts A look at various layout terms
Pawn majority
A passed pawn can 
be an advantage. 
When a player has 
more pawns than 
the opponent on 
one side of the 
board, it’s called 
a majority
Open file
An open file is a 
vertical line on 
the chessboard 
where no pawns 
are present. This 
occurs when 
pawns switch files 
while capturing
Passed pawn
A passed pawn has 
no opposing pawn 
in front of it. During 
the endgame it’s 
a real threat as it 
could reach its 
eighth rank and 
be promoted
Connected 
pawns
Side by side (or 
connected) pawns 
are the strongest 
formation to play. 
They protect the 
weak square of the 
pawn to its side

he word fianchetto means ‘little 
flank’ in Italian. It’s an apt term that 
over the years has been applied to a 
particular pattern of moves involving the 
bishop. The fianchetto allows the bishop 
to develop into an advantageous position. 
This move is likely to appear during the 
opening of a game, as it allows the bishop 
to become more active.
Fianchettoing a bishop involves moving 
either your b or g pawn forward. This will 
then free up the required space for the 
bishop to develop. Once this is done, the 
bishop will be located upon its longest 
diagonal line on the board. This will give 
it control over a good number of squares. 
This makes it a useful offensive weapon 
to have in your arsenal. Thanks to its long 
range, the bishop is poised to spring into 
action if required. It can also serve as a 
way of counteracting your opponent’s 
advances towards the centre squares. On 
some occasions the fianchettoed bishops 
are even saved for the endgame. 
Fianchettos can be played on the 
queen or king side (or both, known as the 
double fianchetto) but the queen’s side 
is usually seen as stronger. If played from 
the king’s side, the pawn structure could 
be weakened by the Fianchetto itself. 
While the fianchetto can be a useful starter 
for a game (it can help beginner players 
think about their long-term positioning), 
it may also prove helpful to an opponent. 
An opposing player would likely start 
thinking ‘outside the box’ about placing 
pieces on locations that may negate the 
effectiveness of the fianchetto. Also, your 
knight could end up being stuck, as if it 
moves in front of the bishop it will block 
the effect of the bishop’s attack. 
With the fianchetto move, your bishop can quickly gain 
control over a long section of the board, making it a 
useful weapon in your arsenal
“This will give the bishop control 
over a good number of squares”
01: Pawn moves out The white knight’s pawn(1) is 
moved forward. If it is moved two squares forwards pending the 
bishop moving, it is known as a long fianchetto.
02: Bishop develops Black(1) makes their move as 
per normal. The white bishop(2) can now move to c3. It now has a 
direct line across the diagonal from b2 to h8.

Top tip
Locked pawns
If you’re playing black and you 
spot that white is playing a 
fianchetto, you can block the 
centre with locked pawns. This 
will cut off the long reach of the 
fianchettoed bishops, along 
 which they could  
otherwise zoom.

03: Extended fianchetto There is an alternative 
space for bishop(1) to take. If it moves to c3, this is known as an 
extended fianchetto. This takes aim at black’s f8 square.
04: Extended attack Should black move the e7 
pawn(1), the white bishop(2) can strike and take the black bishop. 
The king will recapture, but black’s defences are now breached.

2. Black queen

In the final stages 
of the match, the 
queen has moved 
to put pressure 
on the king. It is

FACING A 
FIANCHETTO?
If you’re on the 
receiving end of a 
fianchetto, there 
are options open to 
you. You can attack 
the side where the 
fianchetto has taken 
place. Attacking the 
pawns around the 
bishop can weaken 
your opponent’s 
defensive structure.

C
astling is, on the face of it, a 
highly unusual chess move. It is 
the only move in which you can 
jump over another piece and also the only 
one where you get to move two pieces 
at once. It carried many benefits which 
we will highlight, but there are also many 
reasons which will stop you from castling. 
You can castle kingside or queenside by 
moving your king two squares towards 
your rook, but there must be empty 
squares between the king and the rook 
to complete the move. Also, neither the 
king or rook can have moved previously 
for a castling to take place; this includes 
moving a piece and then moving it back 
to its original position. We won’t stop there, 
however, because you cannot castle if the 
king is in check or will be in check if it is 
castled, the king cannot move through an 
attacked square and, as a final rule, both 
pieces must be on the player’s first rank. 
This may appear to be constrictive, but 
it highlights why castling is most often 
undertaken in the early stages of a game. 
The opportunities are more plentiful 
and the reasons for castling are more 
advantageous thanks to the protection 
of a line of pawns and the need to bring 
powerful places into play. Ideally, you 
should also look to castle kingside because 
it will be closer to the corner of the board 
and as such have a greater degree of 
protection. It also requires the movement 
of fewer pieces to enable the move, but 
there is an upside in that active pieces 
will be nearer the centre of the rank. Each 
situation will determine which way to 
castle and, indeed, if you need to. If you are 
starting out, however, aim to do it as early 
as makes sense in any game you play.
Castling
Castling is a useful move to understand and will 
come in handy no matter where you are in a game. 
It is also unique in chess
Top tip
Two reasons  
to castle
You may think the prime reason 
to castle is to protect the king, 
but it also brings the rook into 
the centre of the board,  
making it more active  
than previously.
“There must be empty squares 
between the king and the rook”
01: Castling any time If the criteria have been met, 
castling can happen at any time and not always at the start of a 
game. Don’t ever miss an opportunity if it’s available.
02: This cannot happen The situation shown 
here is not possible because the white king cannot castle if it 
ends up in check. At no point can the king put itself in check.

03: A legal castling White can, however, castle to 
the left, also known as queenside, even though it does not offer a 
huge advantage in this particular situation. 
04: Again, not possible This looks like a valid 
castling, but the king is not allowed to pass through a square that 
is currently being attacked. In this case, by the white rook.
A muddled board Left or right castling?
Stop right 
there
White cannot 
castle to the right 
because the rook 
has already been 
moved. Even if it 
is returned to h1, 
the move would 
be invalid
An 
opportunity
Black can castle 
now because 
neither the king 
or rook have 
been moved 
previously. It is a 
logical next step for 
added protection
Go left instead
White can, 
however, move two 
squares to the left 
and castle that way, 
In this situation, 
protection is not as 
secure, however
A chink in the 
armour
Black has left 
a small gap by 
moving the pawn 
upwards, but the 
position is still 
preferable in a 
castling sense

01: The first moves Both black and white have 
made their initial moves. White has left three pawns in the corner 
whereas black has not. An immediate differentiation.
02: The next step White has opted to bring the 
knight(1) into play and black has moved a pawn(2) to the centre of 
the board. White is closer to castling at this early stage.
Almost a mirror image Some subtle differences
A small gap
In black’s situation, 
there is a small 
gap which white 
could potentially 
exploit, but it is still 
relatively safe at 
this time
A classic 
castling
White has 
engineered a 
classic castling 
here with three 
pawns and the 
rook protecting the 
king. This is difficult 
to penetrate
So similar
You will often 
see at the start of 
games that many 
pieces mirror each 
other, which means 
that someone 
needs to make the 
first strike

04: The castling White has now castled the king and 
is also protecting the position with the three unmoved pawns in 
front of it. A decent early defensive situation.
05: Black follows suit Black has now also seen the 
opportunity to castle and has moved the bishop(1) out into an 
attacking position. The king and rook are now free to move.
06: Almost duplicate castling Both sides 
have now castled, but there is a slight difference in their positions. 
For the time-being, however, their kings are fairly well protected.

Playing the game
T
he fork is a move designed 
primarily to help you to win a piece 
from your opponent by attacking 
two pieces simultaneously. It is a move 
that can be used by any piece on the 
board, but as with every area of chess, 
some pieces are much more effective at 
forking than others. To create a fork, you 
need to move one of your pieces so that it 
is positioned to take one of two pieces. At 
this point your opponent will have some 
options open to them, but if you have 
used the fork effectively, they may have to 
sacrifice the lower-value piece to preserve 
the higher. For example, if your knight is 
moved to attack the rook and the queen 
at the same time, your opponent will likely 
have to sacrifice the rook, which is already 
a high-value piece. The queen will be safe 
and with some forks your opponent may 
be able to save their queen and move it 
to a position which means that they can 
protect the rook from your knight as well. 
In this situation, however, using the lower-
value knight against two higher-value 
pieces will still work for you because you 
can take the rook and sacrifice your knight 
to the queen. For forks, the knight is a 
very advantageous piece to use because 
it is less likely that your opponent will be 
able to save one piece and then move 
to a position to take your knight. Rooks, 
for example, are less effective at forking 
because they can only move horizontally 
or vertically and there will be many more 
occasions when your opponent will be 
able to save the situation, but the key to 
effective forking is planning ahead and 
taking account of every possibility. The 
main advantage of forking is that it often 
creates a positive outcome. 
Forks
Get to grips with one of the most effective and attacking 
moves in chess. Timed correctly, it can change the 
course of a game
Top tip
A possible  
fork escape
If your queen is forked and you  
can use it to check the opposing 
king, this could give you an extra 
move in which you are able to  
save your second forked  
piece. It’s rare, but it  
can happen.
“Move a piece so it is positioned to 
take one of two pieces”
01: The opportunity White’s knight is in a prime 
position to attack both the rook and the queen in just one move. 
It also needs to move because of the threat from the pawn. 
02: The fork move The knight(1) has now taken the 
pawn and is protected from the king by the bishop. Black now 
has to move the queen to save it at the start of the game.

03: A safe queen Black has now moved the queen to 
a safe position which cannot be immediately attacked by white, 
but the rook is now open to attack from the knight.
04: The rook is gone White can now take the rook 
and the knight will remain safe for the time-being. It is also in an 
aggressive position which can be utilised further on.

sacrifice itself
3. A protective 
move

However, white 
should not take the

in check. The king 
must take priority 
and be protected 
by black

A 
pin is used for a variety of reasons 
and is effective in capturing 
pieces using diversion methods 
and also for potentially destabilising 
your opponent’s game plan. A pin will 
almost always cause a piece to be trapped 
because it has to protect a higher-value 
piece which is the ultimate target. This is 
extremely effective because the natural 
course of action is to protect and not look 
for an attacking outcome. Indeed, it is 
difficult to attack from a pinned position, 
but it is often possible to protect both 
pieces if circumstances allow and to not 
give away an advantageous position at the 
same time. We will demonstrate how pins 
are created and also offer an example of 
how they can be escaped, but of course 
every position is different and that is why 
it is important to plan ahead. If you are 
learning chess, it is wise to understand the 
basics first, but if you can reach a point 
where you can see far enough ahead to 
avoid being pinned in the first place, you 
are well on the way to being a good player. 
Pins can highlight a lack of planning, a 
missed moment earlier in the game or too 
much emphasis on attack and not enough 
on protecting your valuable pieces. Also, 
try to avoid thinking that a pin is designed 
purely to capture a valuable piece, because 
on many occasions they are designed 
to provide a more attacking position for 
the player who has laid the pin. They are 
popular because they can occur by design 
or chance and it is not too difficult to spot 
a potential pin when it comes your way, 
with the added advantage that it is trickier 
to spot a possible pin against you on the 
horizon. If you can master pins, you are 
doing well.
Pins
It is important to understand pins because they are 
common and can occur multiple times within a game, 
especially near the end
Top tip
Don’t feel trapped
When you find yourself in a pin, 
the very first thing to do is look 
for an escape using the pinned 
piece. If you can stop it being 
attacked and also protect the 
target piece, the pin will  
not succeed.
“A pin isn’t always designed purely 
to capture a valuable piece”
01: See the potential It’s white’s move and it 
would be easy to push the queen up the board to attack, but 
there is much more potential in creating a pin in this position.
02: Create the pin When white(1) is moved to this 
position, the c6 knight is now pinned and cannot move. If it does, 
the rook can be taken and this is of a much higher value.

03: A bad move If the knight(1) is moved, white can 
move the queen(2) and take the rook without endangering the 
queen. This also puts the queen in a more attacking position.
04: Time to protect Alternatively, if black leaves the 
knight where it is, the queen can capture it and still attack the 
rook, so one course of action is to protect the knight(1).
An active pin There is an escape
3. A simple 
escape
If the bishop 
moves to this 
position it will 
escape immediate 
capture by the rook 
and also protect 
the knight at the 
same time
1. The attacker
The rook is 
currently attacking 
the bishop and 
consequently 
the knight which 
the bishop has to 
protect. This is a 
relative rook pin
2. Can it move?
In this position, it 
may look as though 
the bishop cannot 
move, but if it 
doesn’t the rook 
can take it without 
endangering itself
4. A protected 
king
The previous 
move may also 
advantageously 
delay the rook, 
which is obviously 
the most powerful 
piece in play,

76  Chess for Beginners
Playing the game
A 
skewer, which is also known as 
an X-ray attack, looks almost 
identical to a pin at first glance 
and does follow the same path, but there 
are different objectives for playing one 
and potentially lesser chance of escape 
by your opponent.
Unlike a pin, the higher-value piece is 
situated in between the target piece and 
your attacking piece, which usually means 
that your opponent has to move it to 
save it from being captured. Escapes can 
occur when you can move the first piece 
to protect the second, but this occurs less 
frequently when a skewer has been built. 
So the best tactic, as always, is to think 
ahead and avoid them being laid in the 
first place.
There are two types of skewer. The 
absolute skewer puts the king in check 
and so it absolutely has to be moved or 
another piece placed in the path. The 
second type is the relative skewer, which 
means that your opponent can accept 
the loss of the piece being attacked if 
they so wish. Skewers are most effective 
when a king is being attacked by a long-
range piece such as a rook which could 
consequently then take the queen if the 
king cannot move to protect it. This is 
more likely at the end of the game and will 
often signal a win for the player placing the 
skewer. Indeed, in normal play, only long-
range pieces are able to skewer thanks to 
their greater coverage, which adds even 
greater value to the bishop, queen and 
rook as the game nears the end of natural 
play. The potential to skewer with one 
of these pieces is always lurking if your 
opponent slips up and misses the threat it 
could pose. Skewers are fairly obvious to 
both sides, but if you get a chance, make 
sure you take it and you will recognise the 
potential as you gain experience.
Skewers
A well-played skewer can win a game almost  
instantly and is particularly effective in the closing  
stages of a tight encounter
Top tip
Sacrifice to skewer
The potential for a skewer to  
be placed is often obvious to an 
experienced player, so you may 
find that you have to sacrifice 
a piece to bring the situation 
about and to hide your  
true intentions.
“In normal play, only long-range 
pieces are able to skewer ”
01: A skewer in play The white bishop is attacking 
the black queen and consequently the rook as well. Black will 
have to move the queen to avoid immediate capture by white.
02: Protecting the queen Black can protect the 
queen(1) by moving to this position, but white can still capture the 
rook and only lose the lower-value bishop. A worthy trade.

03: The lost rook White’s bishop(1) has now taken the 
rook and left black in a weakened position. Black ideally needed 
two high-value pieces to win the game quickly.
04: Queen takes bishop Black has now taken 
the bishop and the game is fairly even, but the loss of the rook is 
a body blow and highlights the power of a well-played skewer.
An absolute skewer A strong position
3. A lost queen
Once the king is 
moved, the black 
bishop can take 
white’s queen.  
Even if the king 
takes the bishop, 
it is a worthy trade 
for black
A STRONGER 
POSITION
Black is now in a 
stronger position 
because it has a 
queen and white 
does not, which 
should mean that 
the game will be 
won soon.
2. Save the 
king
White now has no 
choice, but to move 
the king because 
it is in check. There 
is only one square 
(d2) to which it 
can move to stop 
another attack

Playing the game
T
he exact definition of a battery 
remains unclear because various 
authorities on the game have 
differing opinions on what constitutes 
one, but we will attempt to make it 
clear to you. A battery is unusual in that it 
requires the use of more than one piece, 
but it is extremely effective in achieving a 
forceful position when you may otherwise 
have few opportunities. The easiest way 
to describe a battery is with rooks – which 
are, incidentally, the ideal pieces for this 
move. Imagine two rooks in a row with a 
pawn in front of a queen ahead of them. 
The first rook can take the pawn and be 
protected from the queen by the rook that 
is situated behind it. This is a classic battery 
which uses the power of both pieces 
together to force an unwanted move 
from your opponent or a much stronger 
position which is hard to defend against. A 
promoted pawn to a queen is even more 
effective when used with another queen, 
but bishops can also be used if a pawn has 
been under-promoted and one of your 
original bishops remains on the board. 
It is easier, however, to form batteries 
using pieces that can move horizontally 
and vertically because this is where most 
opportunities will naturally come from. 
Whatever you do, don’t let the thought of 
using the same pieces limit your ambitions. 
A queen and a rook can form a battery or, 
even better, two rooks and a queen can 
form one which is potentially extremely 
powerful and very difficult to escape from 
in the right circumstances. Remember that 
batteries can be used to take pieces, but 
are perhaps more commonly used in the 
endgame, when you have more pieces 
than your opponent, to force a checkmate. 
Batteries
Despite some differing views on what exactly  
a battery is in chess, they are very effective and can  
turn a game very quickly
Top tip
Rooks are common
Rooks are most commonly used 
to form batteries because they 
can easily occupy the same rank 
on the board and you already 
have two. Almost all batteries 
will be formed from two 
 rooks, for obvious  
reasons.
“A classic battery uses the power of 
both pieces together”
01: Nothing obvious? In this position, the black 
king is well protected by the pawn, knight and king. There is, 
however, potential for white to create a powerful battery.
02: A created battery White has now created a 
battery with two rooks, but the sheer level of protection on the 
king means that it is not completely effective at this time.

03: A powerful battery Moving the queen(1) 
between the two rooks creates a very powerful battery of the 
three highest-value pieces on the board. This is a useful position.
04: Black has to defend White does not need to 
move forward immediately, but black does need to consider the 
position and staunchly defend the pawn in front of the queen.

be promoted by 
moving to this 
square, at which 
point a bishop – 
or, even better, a 
queen – can create 
a battery

taking the focus

bishop will now 
have little impact 
on the game.

80  Chess for Beginners
Playing the game
A 
decoy is a simple strategy in 
many ways, but is one that is best 
played once you have a few tough 
games under your belt and when you are 
able to use various moves to trap your 
opponent. It centres around what is called 
‘the poisoned square’ and ideally you will 
be looking to force your opponent to place 
their king or queen on that square. You 
can get away with some large sacrifices to 
force this move onto your opponent and 
still come out ahead, so don’t be afraid 
to give up one or two powerful pieces to 
achieve your goal. The square is considered 
poisoned because of the location of 
pieces close to it and, for example, if your 
opponent moves into it he could be 
placed in a fork that would mean losing 
a valuable piece and then having to deal 
with a much less favourable position. It is in 
effect the moment before a decisive move 
occurs and if you can spot the potential 
and force your opponent to fall into your 
trap, the benefits will become clear very 
quickly. The beauty of a decoy is that it is 
very hard to spot for your opponent and 
this is why it is used by experienced players 
quite often. It is one of the moves that sets 
apart experience from inexperience, so 
initially your goal will be to try to spot the 
potential, no matter how many moves it 
is ahead, rather than trying to play decoys 
yourself. Decoys abound in games of chess 
and the majority are missed by beginners, 
but if you happen to spot one that you 
can use, don’t be afraid to lose pieces and 
just go for it. The experience of completing 
your first decoy will arm you with wise 
knowledge which you can expand upon 
in the future and which you can vary many 
different times.
Try to force your opponent to occupy a 
poisoned square to win a game, but be 
prepared to sacrifice a lot to force their hand
Top tip
It’s a pattern
A decoy is a hidden pattern 
and the best way to learn it is 
to read as many examples of 
successful decoys as you can.  
As with patterns in all walks  
of life, familiarity starts to  
make them obvious.
“The beauty of a decoy is that it is 
very hard to spot”
01: The poisoned square With white to move, 
the poisoned square is located at b5. It is not obvious to see why 
this is, but see if you can guess before reading the next steps.
02: Sacrifice the bishop Moving the bishop(1) 
means that if the queen moves, the king will be in check. The 
queen can be sacrificed or can now take the bishop.

03: The fatal error The logical course is for the 
queen(1) to take the bishop, but it is in fact a clever trap and the 
error has already been made which will change the game.
04: A perfect fork The knight can now move and 
create a fork on the king (which will have to be moved), the rook 
and the queen. A near perfect decoy manoeuvre.

2. Use the 
knight
 A white piece does 
not need to move 
to e3 to cause 
danger because if 
the black knight 
can get to it, a 
problem for white 
will occur
3. Move the 
rook
 Moving the 
rook one square 
can avert the 
immediate 
danger here 
because it stops a 
potential fork from 
happening when 
e3 is taken
4. Protect the

to e3, the rook 
and queen will be 
attacked so moving 
the rook will also 
help to protect the 
queen from a fork

hess traps are known by a variety 
of names and the list of potential 
traps is indeed very long. You 
will hear of traps called Fishing Pole, 
Kieninger and Siberian, but some study 
will be needed to familiarise yourself with 
the most effective ones. As you gain 
experience, you’ll also start to understand 
which ones will work best in the situation 
you are in. The idea is to lay a trap that 
makes your opponent play a losing move, 
but the downside is that if they do not fall 
for it, you may end up in a vastly weakened 
position. It is a move with many downsides 
and one which often takes control away 
from you because you are relying on your 
opponent to fail to a degree rather than 
safely forcing them into a position where 
they are disadvantaged. If you can force 
an opponent’s piece into a position where 
they cannot move at all without the piece 
being taken, you will have put yourself at 
an advantage. This is particularly beneficial 
for high-value pieces such as the queen 
or rook and even more so when the 
king is trapped, but even then there are 
possible downsides. Your opponent should 
have multiple opportunities to avoid a 
trap by moving any one of a number of 
pieces earlier in the game and this is why 
a trap does rely on them not spotting it, 
as much as you laying a clever trap. Any 
piece can be trapped during a game 
and most will lead to a disadvantage of 
some kind because having options and a 
range of movement open to you is key to 
building strategies and ultimately winning. 
It may not feel like an important move in 
comparison to others, but it happens in 
almost every game from the start so is 
worth understanding.
Traps
Chess traps are effective, but do require help from an 
opponent who has to fall for the move.  
There are many different traps
Top tip
All or nothing
The nature of traps means 
that they are usually an ‘all or 
nothing’ move – if not pulled off 
successfully, they may well leave 
you in a weakened position.  
You will need to use traps  
very wisely.
“The idea is to lay a trap that makes 
your opponent play a losing move”
01: No obvious trap White’s first consideration here 
may be to ensure that the queen has no obvious threat. The fact 
that there is one coming could easily distract them. 
02: A threatening pawn When black’s pawn(1) is 
moved forward, the queen is immediately under threat. It cannot 
take the pawn as it will also be taken by the other pawn at d6.

03: Time to retreat The logical move is for the 
queen(1) to retreat to protect itself, but this is exactly what black is 
hoping for. The trap can now be set with one move. 
04: A trapped bishop As you can see, the bishop 
is now trapped and cannot move to any position without being 
taken. The trapping pawn(1) is also protected. A tricky position.
A perfect trap The king is dead
2. A key knight 
The knight is under 
attack from the 
black queen, but it 
is white’s move and 
this will make all of 
the difference to 
the endgame
1. A weak 
position?
White has lower-
value pieces still left 
on the board and 
in theory black’s 
queen against 
white’s knight 
should give black 
an advantage
4. The trap 
square 
If white’s knight 
moves to f7, black’s 
king is trapped 
and has nowhere 
to move to. The 
game is now 
effectively over
3. A useless 
queen

is of course a 
powerful piece, is

P
awn promotion is magical in its 
own way and can make all the 
difference to the ending of a game. 
It will happen deep into a game because 
the pawn has to reach the eighth rank to 
be exchanged for another piece, which will 
mean that many moves have already been 
made by your opponent to free up the 
rank and allow for the pawn progression. 
The pawn can be swapped for any piece 
and it does not matter if it is technically 
not available because it can still be used. 
In real games the required piece will need 
to be found and, for example, an upside-
down rook can also be used to designate 
a queen. As it happens, the queen is often 
chosen to replace the pawn because of 
its range of movement, and so is a rook. It 
is not, however, unheard of for a knight to 
be chosen if a specific position warrants 
its unique style of movement and so you 
should not presume to always opt for a 
queen when a promotion is available. If 
you do choose a piece other than the 
queen, it is called ‘under-promotion’ and 
swapping for a queen is often called 
‘queening’. You should always consider 
carefully when to move your pawn to 
the eighth rank and ideally think of it as 
a queen when it gets close to the end of 
the board. There is no point in promoting 
your pawn and having it taken or trapped 
immediately, and thinking of it as a queen 
is more likely to focus your mind on its 
potential value. It is also important to 
practise with a promoted piece because 
having two queens, or indeed a duplicate 
of any other piece, will feel unusual if you 
have played with a standard set for a long 
time. It changes your entire chess-playing 
mindset instantly.
Pawn 
promotion
Pawn promotion looks obvious, but there is a lot to think about 
when your pawn survives a tortuous trip to  the eighth rank
Top tip
Defending pawn 
promotions
During the middle and endgame, 
always be aware of the potential 
for a pawn to be promoted and 
consider blocking its path if  
you have an obvious  
opportunity 
 to do so.
“Consider carefully when to move 
your pawn to the eighth rank”
01: Time to move The white pawn can be promoted 
in this situation, but the obvious danger is the black rook which 
can immediately move and capture it. No need to panic.
02: It’s now promoted The pawn(1) has been 
promoted to a queen, but black moves next. The temptation to 
immediately take the white queen may be too obvious to avoid.

03: An obvious move The rook has now taken the

The promotion to a powerful queen worked in this situation.
04: Game over? The end result is a board where white 
now has a rook to play with and black only has the king. The 
promotion helped develop this powerful position.

ugzwang is a position you 
may find yourself in where the 
obligation to move a piece, rather 
than passing, puts you at a disadvantage. 
The literal meaning of this German word 
is ‘obligation to move’ and that really 
does sum it up. Usually, it will mean your 
opponent having to move a piece that 
is defending a higher-value piece, often 
the crucial king, and at the end of a game 
where few pieces remain, it could bring 
about a win very quickly. You can build 
up to a zugzwang, but often in games 
the opportunity will just arise and you 
can then quickly fashion a situation where 
your opponent is obliged to make a move 
they don’t want to. The term does not 
necessarily refer to simply having a piece 
attacked by your opponent because this 
can happen multiple times throughout a 
game, but is more confined to a strategic 
position where to move would be 
detrimental. When there are only a few 
pieces left on the board – for example, 
a king verses a king and rook – whoever 
has the next move can make all of the 
difference to the outcome of the game 
and a zugzwang is often used to force a 
draw or a win in this situation. It is a skill 
worth learning early on when you start to 
play chess because it is commonly used to 
close out games and not understanding 
it could cause a game to continue for an 
unnecessarily long time, or even create a 
losing situation where you should have 
won. Zugzwang brings together many 
aspects of basic chess theory and as 
such will also help you to understand 
other moves and how everything comes 
together to build a winning strategy. It’s a 
good place to start learning.
Zugzwang
If you can force a zugzwang on your opponent, 
particularly near the end of a game, you will end 
up in an advantageous position
Top tip
Don’t force it
Try not to force a zugzwang 
early on since there will be 
many opportunities for your 
opponent to avoid it occurring. 
Take advantage of a situation 
when it happens and  
time it right.
“Where the obligation to move a 
piece puts you at a disadvantage”
01: Black is cornered Black is rooted to the corner, 
but the pawns are protecting the king effectively. Without a 
knight, white can force a zugzwang to win the game.
02: Sacrifice the rook White can now move the 
rook(1) and sacrifice it, which may look initially as though the 
advantage is lost, but in this case it is a decisive winning move.

03: The zugzwang Black(1) is forced to take the rook 
straight away, otherwise the rook will take the pawn in front of 
the king and black will lose the game quickly anyway.
04: The final move White can now win the game 
by moving the pawn(1) forward. Black has nowhere to go because 
the white king is protecting the pawn. The game is now over.
A classic trebuchet Whoever moves loses
Under attack
It is white’s move 
and there is no 
choice but to 
move the king 
immediately 
because the pawn 
is blocked from 
making any move
3. Reversing 
the situation
If the situation 
were reversed, 
black would have 
to move the king 
and white could 
take the black 
pawn. A classic 
zugzwang situation
2. The last 
pawn 
Black’s king can 
now take white’s 
pawn, which 
means that the 
game is effectively 
over. The extra 
pawn will make the 
difference here
4. A common 
trebuchet

arises like this, 
where whoever 
has the next move 
will lose the game, 
it is described as

88  Chess for Beginners
Playing the game
Y
ou may think that a draw in 
chess is easy to learn, but there 
is in fact a lot to take in and the 
permutations that can bring about such 
a position are vast. The conclusion at 
the end of a drawn game will also differ 
depending on what position you were in 
just before a draw is declared or forced. It 
could be that you should have won the 
game and fell into an obvious trap; on 
the flip side, you may have been down 
significantly and managed to fool your 
opponent into making the exact wrong 
move at the wrong time. For example, if a 
player is not in check, but their opponent 
has colluded to bring about a situation 
where they cannot make a legal move, 
the game will be a draw and a potential 
winning situation lost in the blink of an eye. 
This is the most common way for draws 
to occur, but there are many other reasons 
and we will explain them all to you so that 
you will know how to force one or how to 
avoid creating a drawing situation from a 
winning position. A draw can come about 
by consent between both players if they 
realise that the game is unlikely to end 
in a win for either one of them or even 
when moves are repeated three times in 
a row. There is a lot to look out for when 
considering the likelihood of a draw within 
a game and all of these possibilities have to 
be considered on top of basic strategy and 
the ongoing threats from your opponent. 
While it is true that draws will almost 
certainly come about near the end of a 
game, you should always be aware of the 
potential for one to be forced upon you 
by an opponent who is looking weakened 
in the middlegame or even earlier. Here, if 
you can, try to avoid drawing.
Draws
As in all games, a draw is something to be  
avoided if at all possible. However, a draw from  
a losing position is an achievement
Top tip
Different rules
The official rules for drawn 
games differ depending on 
the level you are playing at, so 
it is always wise to understand 
what exactly constitutes a 
draw if you reach the  
level of playing in 
competitions.
“It could be that you should have 
won the game and fell into a trap”
01: An obvious stalemate The black king is 
trapped by the white queen and king, but not in check. Black 
cannot move without being in check, so it is a stalemate.
02: A dangerous queen The white queen is the 
problem because it can cover much ground in one move. Here it 
has caused a stalemate by not checking the king.

03: A bizarre situation In this highly unusual 
situation, it could easily be deemed that a possibility of a 
checkmate is impossible. This would then lead to an agreed draw.
04: The fifty-move rule The fifty-move rule was 
imposed in this situation because no pieces were captured and 
no pawns were moved in the previous 50 moves. This is a draw.
Threefold repetition Perpetual check works
2. It can move
The black king 
can only move to 
the corner square 
to escape check, 
which puts white in 
a position to force a 
threefold repetition
3. Vary the 
move
White can actually 
move another 
piece such as the 
bishop during the 
threefold move 
process and the 
repetition will 
remain in place
1. Check the 
king
If the white rook 
moves here, the 
black king will 
immediately be 
placed in check and 
is also blocked from 
moving freely
4. Helpless 
pawns
The pawns are 
helpless to affect 
the situation 
because white can 
continually place 
black in check to 
force a draw with 
fewer pieces

01: Tough for black Black is in a predicament here 
because white has the advantage with a queen as opposed to

The game could

both sides, but an 
agreement to draw 
makes more sense
3. The king 
can’t help
The king will not 
be able to force a 
decisive move even 
with the pawn 
next to it and so 
this exact situation 
cannot produce 
a win
2. Cannot 
promote
Black would ideally 
like to promote its 
remaining pawn, 
but cannot do so as 
white is currently 
blocking it from 
moving at all
1. Really a 
draw?
White has just 
moved its right-
hand pawn past 
the king and while 
this situation may 
not look like a draw, 
it certainly will be

05: A lost queen When white moves the king(1), 
black can now take the high-value queen with the knight, which 
completely changes the position and balance of the game.
06: A drawn game With only the kings plus the 
black knight(1) remaining on the board, this is likely to lead to a 
draw from what was once a losing situation for black.
04: The killer fork Black moves the knight(1) to create 
a fork on white’s king and queen. It is a decisive move because 
white now has no choice but to save the king.

Playing the game
C
hess is a game of strategy, tactics, prediction and forward 
thinking. It is important in a game to be able to think one 
or two moves ahead of your current position, calculating 
the most likely moves of your opponents before they make them, 
and adjusting your strategy accordingly. It’s also equally important 
not to get ahead of yourself with your moves. Sometimes a 
game has to be played out move by move, and often the most 
important tactic for a player is to get their most valuable pieces 
into strong positions across the board. There are several beginner 
tactics to be learnt about positioning in a game to give you a 
better chance of success. Interception is one of the easiest tactics 
to apply in a game. This consists of blocking an opponent’s piece 
with one of your own, ideally a pawn which has little value against 
other pieces. In the following tutorials you’ll learn some beginner 
tactics and general rules of thumb to be applied, which will help 
you to stay in the game and start conquering your opponents. 
Opponents will adapt to your plays, so you must always be ready 
to bend the rules of tactical chess playing. 
Beginner 
tactics
Once you’ve got a handle on the basics of chess, it’s 
important to get to grips with some beginner tactics 
 
Top tip
Learn how to  
use pawns
Pawns are plentiful and 
expendable, so don’t be afraid 
to use them to help you with 
your learning curve. Games 
can be won or lost by 
the tactics applied 
to pawns.

Chess for Beginners  93
03: Knights and bishops A knight with access 
to the centre squares provides an attack and defence position. 
Bishops in the centre create a diagonal line of defence and attack.
04: Vulnerable zone Try to avoid placing any of 
your key pieces there. Although your queen can do a lot from the 
centre, you may have to waste a turn retreating her.
01: Centre squares The d4, e4, d5 and e5 squares 
rest at the centre of the board. If you can take control of these 
squares you will have much more control over the game.
02: Pawn control Getting your pawns in the centre 
squares creates a blockade of movement from either side of the 
board, plus they are less valuable pieces to lose.
The centre of the chessboard is a crucial piece of real estate in a game. Understanding how to control the centre of the 
board can help lead you to victory over your opponent

03: Exceptions to the rule There is always an 
exception to ‘knights before bishops’. Here the white queen and 
bishops have created a strong diagonal line of defence. 
04: Bishop’s Opening The Bishop’s Opening is a 
classic opening tactic, not often used nowadays. It can surprise an 
opponent and have them rethink their opening strategy.
01: Knights before bishops This saying refers 
to the basic tactical approach of getting your knights forward and 
toward the centre before positioning your bishops.
02: Why knights and bishops? They 
are both pieces that can quickly access and control the centre 
squares without putting themselves in a vulnerable position.
A beginner’s rule of thumb in chess is to develop your knights and bishops ahead of other pieces. This is a good 
starting tactic to quickly set yourself up into an attacking position

Restricting movement and gaining control with knights and bishops
Knights and bishops gain control
01: Controlling the centre If you have more 
control over the centre than your opponent, avoid exchanging 
pieces, even if it means advancing or strengthening your defence.
02: Advance, don’t exchange Rather than 
beginning a vicious cycle of exchanging pieces, the white rook(1) 
moves from c2 to c4, ready to attack the black knight on g4.
2. Bishop 
placement 
Both the white 
bishops have been 
able to develop. 
The g5 bishop 
has temporarily 
blocked the f6 
knight, as it must 
protect the queen
3. Exchanging 
pieces 
If necessary, both 
the black and 
white knights 
and bishops 
could exchange 
pieces if they felt it 
beneficial to free 
up the board
1. Knights’ 
centre control 
Knights on both 
the black and white 
side have control 
over the centre 
of the board and 
its surrounding 
area, restricting 
movement
4. Advancing 
queen and 
knight 
By developing the 
white knight from 
f3 to e5, both the 
white knight and 
queen can advance 
further along the

03: Exchange if attacked When under attack, 
exchanging pieces can even out a game. The d3 knight could 
sacrifice itself taking the c5 knight, weakening black’s attack. 
04: Counter-attack Once the c5 black bishop(1) has 
taken the white knight, the c1 white bishop(2) can move to e3, 
protecting the king from a being checked by the c5 black bishop. 
01: Changing values At the beginning of a game, 
knights and bishops are not worth exchanging unless absolutely 
necessary. Here there is a standoff between bishops and knights. 
02: When to exchange If white goes ahead with 
the attack on both black knights, a lot of the game’s pieces are 
lost, although white still has a single bishop and knight.
Exchanging pieces refers to the taking of an opponent’s piece at the cost of one of your own. When exchanging, 
consider the value of pieces at different points of the game

03: Queen/rooks blockade When pawns get 
into a stalemate with each other, it can change the dynamic of a 
game, forcing players to work around or disassemble the block. 
04: Pawn promotion An opponent may try to 
promote their pawn near the end of a game. Rooks are the best 
form of defence against an opponent’s promotion attempt.
01: Blocking pieces The knight is the perfect 
piece for blocking a pawn, since it isn’t restricted by the pawn’s 
presence if it needs to move, releasing the pawn from the block. 
02: Rook pawns Blocking rook pawns with a knight 
will restrict your knight. Blockading a rook pawn with a rook 
pawn helps to buffer a rook once it gets developed. 
Pawns are expendable infantry, so they can get into strategically strong positions without risk. Blockading a pawn stops 
it in its tracks and can protect your blocking piece

03: Corner mate The black pawn has restricted the 
king from moving forward. When checked by the knight, it can 
only move to the g file, which can be covered by a rook or queen.
04: Mate with two bishops In this pattern the 
white pawn is again restricting the king. Once the black bishop 
moves into a check position, the king will be completely trapped.
01: Queen and bishop This pattern uses the fact 
that the white king is cornered. Once the queen goes to g2, the 
king won’t be able to escape nor take the queen.
02: Mate with pawns Once the white pawn 
moves up to f7, the black king is rendered immobile. This pattern 
utilises the fact that kings can’t sit next to each other.
There are thousands of different checkmate patterns. A lot of them time they are variations of very common patterns 
which can be very simple and effective in their execution

05: Smothered mate When a king is too well 
protected, an opponent can use a knight to place the king in 
check, leaving it with absolutely nowhere to go.
06: Two-move mate This is the quickest possible 
way to win. Here the queen(1) can move into a mate position in 
the second move if the king has been appropriately exposed.
Checkmate
The white knight 
which originally 
protected the 
bishop is now 
used to stop the 
black king from 
moving to the 
d7 position on 
the board
3. Centre knight
Once the king has moved 
out of check from the 
bishop, the left-hand 
white knight can be 
moved to the centre to 
create a checkmate
2. Bishops
By sacrificing 
your queen to the 
black bishop, the 
white bishop can 
entrench itself 
next to the black 
king, protected by 
the knight
1. Using 
Légal’s Mate

100  Chess for Beginners
Playing the game
T
his example game highlights how 
the position you are in at any time 
can change very quickly. You can 
spend time building up an attack, take 
many pieces and then still miss a potential 
trap that your opponent has laid over 
many moves. It is easy to focus on your 
own position and to become wrapped 
up in the feeling of power when you have 
more pieces and a dominant position on 
the board, but you also need to focus on 
your opponent in equal measure to win 
the game. Chess is not about dominating 
the board or taking the most pieces. It 
is about finding a strategy that will beat 
your opponent and a win can come from 
very few pieces if the timing is right and 
the tactics are clever enough. You will see 
skewers and batteries used in this game, 
as well as good examples of effective 
castling and many other moves that are 
also covered in this book. The level of 
this game is fairly advanced, but don’t let 
that put you off because it is instructional 
and highlights how you need to think for 
yourself just as much as learning what 
moves to play in a particular situation. 
The more you play, the more familiar this 
game will feel to you and that is when you 
know you are becoming a worthy chess 
opponent for most players. It’s time to see 
who wins this game.
The final  
move matters
Castling, skewers, batteries and other tactics make up 
this intriguing example of a hard-fought, and lucky, win
Top tip
Beware of traps
The main lesson to take 
from this game is that if your 
opponent is giving away 
too many high-value pieces, 
there may be a trap at the 
end of it. Most players will  
try to keep rooks and  
queens in play.
01: The opening Black and white have made two 
moves each, with both sides offering an attacking and quite open 
position early on. This position leaves both with something to 
think about because there are immediate opportunities to bring 
the black bishop or the white queen into play. White could move 
the bishop to g5 to force a very early attack on black’s queen.
02: Think ahead White has moved the king’s bishop(1) 
in an unsurprising move, but it does give potential for a castling 
in the relatively near future. Black(2) does the same kingside and 
so both have a fairly high-value piece in an unconfined position. 
Note that white’s queen is also free to move vertically, but black’s 
has more protection at this particular stage of the game.

05: Freeing the queens White’s next move is 
to bring the queen(1) out slightly to d2, which potentially gives it 
more flexibility. It is also protecting the bishop on g5 and so black 
opts to move the pawn(2) in front of its queen to d6 to follow a 
similar path. Its queen now has a limited amount of mobility, but 
this represents a starting position to bring it forward quickly.
03: It’s getting interesting White moves 
the knight(1) to c3, which may imply a desire to move the pawn 
on e2 to e4. Black responds with knight(2) to f6. There is then a 
possibility of moving the black knight to e4, which would create a 
fork against white’s knight and two other pawns if none of these 
pieces is moved next. However, the next move is white’s.
06: Simple pawn moves White now moves its 
pawn(1) to h4, which offers some protection to the bishop while 
freeing up the rook. Black(2) could move to e5 to attack the white 
pawn on d4, but to do so could mean the piece being taken 
without any recourse. It also potentially leaves open a series of 
moves where the c6 knight could be taken by white’s g2 bishop.
04: A skewer White moves the bishop(1) to g5 and 
immediately creates a skewer against the knight and the pawn. It 
is a bold move and highlights a possible intention to attack early 
on. Black moves its knight(2) to c6 to then potentially move it to 
e5 and then f7 to attack the bishop on g5. In this situation, you 
should now sit back and analyse all that is occurring.

09: A lost pawn White moves its pawn(1) to e4, which 
puts it under attack from a number of pieces, but black chooses 
to take it using its pawn(2) on f5. The black pawn is now under 
attack from the white knight, but also protected by its own 
knight. As you can see, the pieces are starting to move to the 
centre, so it’s another opportunity to analyse the position.
07: A castling manoeuvre White now castles 
to offer some protection for its king. There is a steady line of 
protection and free squares allowing this move to take place. 
Black, on the other hand, now decides to attack white’s bishop by 
moving its pawn(1) to h6. This does give white’s bishop an obvious 
fork, but you have to consider if a fork is always worth having.
10: Avoid the obvious White decides to take the 
pawn on e4 with its knight(1), which leaves it vulnerable to the 
black knight on f6. The obvious move is to take the white knight, 
but white could then take it with its bishop and attack the other 
black knight at the same time without fear of being taken itself. 
Black opts to move the knight(2) to d5, to attack the bishop.
08: Time to retreat White retreats the bishop(1) to f4, 
but still threatens two of black’s pawns. White could have taken 
black’s knight, but there’d be little advantage gained as black 
could then take it back and move to a slightly more advanced 
position than before. Black responds by moving its bishop(2) in 
front of the queen to cover the knight, pawn and queen.

13: A clever sacrifice White puts itself under attack 
by moving the pawn(1) to c5, but it is creating a fork and attacking 
black’s knight and pawn simultaneously. Keep an eye on the 
white bishop at f4 too as, if black moves the d pawn out of the 
way, this can potentially take the black pawn on c7 without fear of 
immediate capture. Black(2) takes the white pawn on c5 anyway.
11: Adding protection White moves knight(1) to  
e2 which, as you can see, offers protection to the d4 pawn and  
more importantly the bishop on f4. Black reconsider its next 
move because simply taking the bishop on f4 with the knight 
would put white in a strong position and the black knight would 
be lost immediately anyway. Protection is always key(2).
12: Happy to retreat White moves its pawn(1) to c4, 
which means that it could take black’s knight, which is of course 
a more valuable piece. Black decides to retreat the knight(2) to b6, 
which means that the pawn is still under attack from it. Never be 
afraid to retreat if there is no upside to losing a piece. Chess is not 
about attacking or defending. It is about winning.
Who is winning? 
An intriguing position
It is far from easy to ever decide who is winning a game halfway 
through, but there are some indications here that white is slightly 
ahead. The overall position on the board puts white’s bishop, 
knight and two pawns further advanced against black’s singular 
pawn. Both queens are fairly well protected, but the first danger 
comes from the white bishop, which could advance into a very 
strong position quickly. Any chess game is up in the air until the 
final move and one mistake in a position like this could make all of 
the difference. The smart money would be on white.

16: The rook is gone White(1) swoops in and takes 
the rook on f8 which then attacks the black bishop on g7. There is 
no loss for black in taking the bishop so the rook(2) on a8 takes the 
it to add extra protection to the king. The mathematical position 
at this point would put white ahead in terms of piece value, and 
even the advanced position is somewhat favourable.
14: The could be bad White(1) makes the obvious 
move and takes the c7 pawn. It does not enable it to take another 
piece straight away, but the position is advanced and something 
to build on. Black retreats again and castles to protect the king. 
This part of the game could be considered to be lost by black, 
but there’s always the chance to change things if you think big.
17: A potential battery White’s pawn(1) captures 
the black pawn on c5 to then attack the black knight on b6. Your 
first thought may be to protect the knight(2) and move it, which is 
correct, but black moves it to d5 for two reasons. Not only will this 
protect the knight through the adjacent pawn, but it shields the 
bishop on d7 from a battery of the white queen and rook. 
15: A small hop White moves the bishop(1) to d6 
which creates an immediate skewer on black’s queen on e7 and 
the rook on f8. There is no piece that can attack the bishop, so 
black makes what looks like another obvious move by shifting the 
queen(2) to f7 to avoid capture. The rook is now under direct threat 
from the bishop and white’s position is again looking strong.

20: Attack the queen! White moves the knight(1) 
to d6 to attack the queen. As the queen(2) is such a valuable piece, 
black has no choice but to move it to safety and leave the knight 
in a powerful position. The move by white is quite obvious and 
should have likely been spotted by black earlier, but this is chess 
and it is never easy to see what’s coming next.
18: Continuing the advance White now 
moves pawn(1) to f4 to continue the advance; it’s protected by 
the knight on e2 despite being under threat from black’s knight 
on d5. Black then moves the rook(2) to d8 to give the bishop and 
knight some protection. This file is now full of powerful pieces 
and could divert attention from one player, who may miss a trap.
19: All-out attack The decision by white to move the 
knight(1) to c3 is aggressive and immediately puts the black knight 
on d5 under attack. Even though the pawn could take the white 
knight if it were allowed to advance, an advantage would not be 
evident. Black decides to move its knight(2) to b4, which saves it 
and protects the d5 square from a move by the white knight.
21: A rook in danger White uses the knight(1) to 
take the b7 pawn so it can now attack the rook. You may think it 
logical to protect the rook by moving it, but that would put the 
bishop under threat from the battery of queen and rook, and put 
black in a very bad position. The only logical choice here is to give 
up the rook and move the knight(2) to d4. Think differently.

24: A strong move White moves the bishop(1) to 
d5, which is directly attacking the black king if the white knight 
moves, but it is also protected by the knight on c3. Black’s 
response of moving the queen(2) to f5 is, however, a threatening 
move as well. It is protecting the bishop on d3 and is under no 
threat itself. It still looks like the balance of power is with white.
22: A fight back? White makes the obvious move 
of taking the rook on d8 with the knight(1) and this puts it in an 
even more powerful position in terms of pieces. The next move 
by black could be seen as a surprise when it moves the bishop(2) 
from d7 to b5. It is not offering any obvious piece protection, but 
is protected by the knight on d4. Is a potential trap being laid?
25: Another piece gone White(1) takes the 
black knight on d4, which also puts the king in check from the 
white bishop on d5. Black has no choice but to deal with this, so 
captures the white bishop with the queen(2). You may now think 
that white should take the queen with the knight on c3, but this 
would be checkmate in two moves. Can you see how?
23: Both sides attacking The white knight(1) 
takes the e6 pawn and threatens the queen. If you are learning to 
play the game, the obvious move would be to move the queen, 
but the two black knights are threatening the king? A counter 
move would be to potentially give up the powerful queen and 
move the bishop(2) to d3. Take some time to study this position.

28: The killer move White(1) takes the knight on b4 
to directly attack black’s queen, but it is in fact a fatal mistake. 
Black(2) moves to a1 to put the white king in checkmate. The 
passage of play near the end of the game highlights how a game 
can be turned around with fewer pieces and clever thinking. It 
does help if your opponent doesn’t see the trap, of course.
26: The danger spotted White spots the danger 
of black moving knight to a2 and checking the king, so moves its 
own knight(1) to c2 instead of taking the queen. Black(2), however, 
then takes the white knight on c3 to start to turn the game 
around. All of a sudden, black appears to be levelling the game 
from a position of power for white not so many moves ago.
27: Save the queen? White(1) captures the bishop 
on c3 that is attacking its queen and then black(2) captures the 
pawn on a2 to bring the queen into a very aggressive position. 
White now has to think carefully about the next move, but is up 
significantly on piece value and on the face of it is still in a strong 
position. In chess, however, there may always be a wrong move.
A clever trap 
One wrong move
Black won this game with some clever thinking despite the fact 
that it was way down on piece value. For the vast majority of the 
game, white was in a strong position and ultimately one move 
decided it. If white had taken black’s knight in the penultimate 
move with the pawn on c3 instead, it is highly likely that white 
would have been able to use the extra pieces and win the game 
quite comfortably. This entire game highlights how chess is never 
over until the very final move and that it can swing many times 
throughout, but remember that this is a fairly advanced example.

f you have a smartphone or 
tablet such as an iPhone, iPad or 
one of the many Android devices, 
you can play chess no matter where 
you are. When you are out with just 
your phone, on a break at work, in  
a coffee shop, or on the train, you  
can play and brush up on your  
chess knowledge and tactics. A  
tablet can be used from the  
comfort ofyour sofa and you don’t 
need to sit at a computer desk,  
which makes it all the more relaxing 
and enjoyable to play your game. 
Tablets are great to take on holiday  
or when travelling and you can  
carry a chess grandmaster in  
your bag.
Chess apps are more powerful 
than you might think and on their 
top difficulty levels they can play a 
tough game. Fortunately, most have 
an easy setting for beginners. Many 
apps are very helpful for novices and 
if you are just learning to play, it is 
better than playing with a physical 
chess set. For example, some apps 
will highlight all the moves a piece 
can make when you tap it. A few will 
even highlight dangerous positions 
to move to and so, armed with this 
knowledge, you can study the board 
and work out why it might not be a 
good idea to move there.
Another common feature in chess 
apps is the inclusion of puzzles. Some 
apps have thousands and you are 
presented with a board setup and 
have to work out the best move to 
make, how to checkmate in one, two 
or three moves and so on. Chess 
puzzles are brilliant for sharpening 
your skills and because they are quick 
to solve, you can study one when 
you only have a few minutes to spare.

app is that it supports Game Center. Playing 
the computer is okay, but playing against 
real people is much better and you can 
get a better idea of your skills compared to 
other players. Chess can find you someone 
to play through Game Center and with 
millions of Mac owners on the internet, a 
partner can be found in a minute or two. 
Voice control is another unusual feature of 
this app and you don’t even need to touch 
a mouse or trackpad. Just sit back, relax 
and tell your Mac which piece to move and 
where to. That’s clever!

to choose from and it is a lot of fun to play 
for all ages and ability levels. An alternative 
program is Arena Chess (playwitharena.de). 
It is complicated and best suited to PC and 
chess experts, but it runs on both old and new 
versions of Windows.

C
orrespondence chess applies to 
games that are played remotely, 
but not in real-time. The game is 
played at a more leisurely pace with one 
person making their move, then – once 
they’ve been notified – their opponent can 
make their move and so on.
The main advantage of correspondence 
chess is that you can fit it more easily 
around your life, plus it allows you to 
take longer over moves. The downside is 
that it can take weeks or even months to 
complete a game, while you’re relying on 
the honesty of your opponent to not cheat 
by using outside help such as a computer 
chess engine.
One of the easiest ways to play 
correspondence chess is by a combination 
of email and web browser – the step-by-
step guide reveals how to set up and play a 
game using chess.com, but there are some 
excellent sites dedicated to correspondence 
chess too: queenalice.com, gameknot.com 
Correspondence 
chess
Looking for a more leisurely way to play chess? Correspondence 
chess lets you take days between moves, not minutes.
 
Top tip
Multi-play
Correspondence chess’s more 
sedate pace allows you to play 
multiple games simultaneously 
– all the major sites allow 
you to run more than one 
game at a time. Just don’t 
confuse one game 
with another!
02: Choose opponent By default a random 
opponent is selected – the default settings are aimed at less 
experienced chess players, so tweak if you wish. Alternatively, 
select a specific chess.com member or email an invite to a friend.
01: Set up a correspondence game Log 
into your chess.com account, then click the Play tab and choose 
Online Chess to set up a turn-based game of chess that can be 
played at a leisurely pace compared to one played ‘live’.

C
hess is, above all, a polite and sportsmanlike experience. 
Shake hands with your opponent, both before and after a 
match, and be ready to congratulate them if you lose. It’s 
also a good idea to keep your talking to a minimum – don’t try to 
intimidate your opponent beforehand and avoid distracting them 
during play. Similarly, avoid other annoying habits like drumming 
your feet or tapping a pencil. Also, stay close to the game while 
it’s in progress – bathroom breaks are permitted, but don’t keep 
wandering off while your opponent mulls their next move.
Other forms of polite behaviour including removing a taken 
piece from the board rather than knocking it down first. Also, 
while it’s not strictly necessary to say the word ‘check’ as both 
players should be aware of the position in the game, it’s still good 
manners to do so, particularly when playing a novice.
Finally, always obey the rules of chess to the letter. So respect 
touch-move if it’s been applied and remember that once your 
hand is released from the piece, your move has ended and you 
cannot change it.
Etiquette for 
beginners
Knowing the correct etiquette is as important as knowing the rules 
of chess, so in this guide discover what you need to know
Top tip
Got a complaint?
If you want to dispute your 
opponent’s last move, don’t 
directly address them. Instead, 
simply raise your hand and wait 
for the arbiter to make the final 
decision, which you should 
obviously respect.

Chess for Beginners  125
Resign a game If you find yourself in a losing position, 
you can resign the game at any time without fear of censure. 
Simply offer your resignation and – if it’s accepted, which it 
should be – the game is over. Don’t forget to shake hands!
Draw rejected If it’s rejected, don’t keep offering the 
draw until the position of the game has changed significantly. 
Badgering your opponent every other move is bad form and will 
quickly get you reported to the tournament organisers.
Offer a draw If you feel a game will end in stalemate, 
you can – but only after making your move – say “I offer a draw” 
and hit your clock. Do not extend your hand until your opponent 
does so, and don’t intimidate them into accepting.
How to win Don’t automatically assume the game is 
ended as soon as you say “checkmate”. Make sure your opponent 
agrees before shaking hands, resetting the board and – if 
applicable – going to the scorer’s table.

Reasons to join a club
Whether it’s to further your understanding 
of the game, make new friends, or just get 
you out of the house on a certain evening, 
there are many reasons to join a chess 
club. However, as you’ll soon discover, 
the benefits of doing so will perhaps 
outweigh your reasons for joining in the 
first place.
As with any game or sport, practice 
and repetition is a key way to improve 
your game. So, joining a club and playing 
against others with varying levels of skill 
and experience will enhance your own 
game in the long run as you pick up tips 
and learn to adapt your own game to 
cope with the different styles favoured by 
other players. Ultimately though, joining a 
tournaments – so you can hone your skills 
in a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere 
and then test yourself against other 
players from different clubs. 
Some chess clubs may also run internal 
events geared towards improving play, 
where the more experienced players offer 
talks and practical demonstrations to help 
novices learn new styles of play. Whether 
you choose to adopt these alternative 
styles and techniques into your own game 
is up to you, but knowledge is power 
and increasing your overall perception 
of the game and the many techniques 
involved will only aid your own game 
down the line as you will be able to pick 
up characteristics in your opponents’ 
games and be better equipped to deal 
with them.
As everyone is individual and plays 
the game in different ways (and with 
varying levels of patience and aggression), 
increasing your own repertoire of skills is 
vital if you are to counteract the different 
challenges that present themselves. And 
joining a club and playing against as many 
different people as possible will only aid 
you own game. Still unconvinced about 
getting involved?
Joining a club
We outline the key benefits of joining a chess club, 
how to go about doing so and/or testing your skills 
against others online
chess club will provide more opportunities 
to play competitive and non-competitive 
chess and help you gain vital experience 
to increase your knowledge of the 
game. Many clubs run their own internal 
competitions and participate in one 
or more local leagues and knockout

Chess for Beginners  127
How to join a  
chess club
The best thing about joining a club is the 
social aspect. You are able to interact with 
people and make new friends and you 
are also less likely to play time-wasting 
morons (a danger of playing online) – it’s 
easy to slate others online, but real clubs 
won’t tolerate loud and disruptive players. 
The first step to joining a chess club is to 
make contact and, thanks to the wonders 
of modern technology, this is easier than 
ever. You can do an internet search for 
local clubs (try typing ‘chess club’ into 
Google Maps, for example, and local clubs 
should be marked on the map in relation 
to your current location) and the contact 
details should become apparent. You can 
then phone or email a club representative 
or find out when they meet up and pop 
along in person to see if you like the 
environment and the people who attend.
There are other options too. One 
example is the National Correspondence 
Chess Club, which offers a wide range 
of tournaments, including an annual 
championship, a knockout, all all-play-all 
and many others to suit all playing levels 
and requirements. This club also offers a 
friendlies section where you can try out 
those tactics that you’ve always wanted 
to try without risking your grading or 
reputation. Although founded as (and 
still focused mainly on being) a post 
correspondence chess club, methods of 
play in most tournaments are agreed by 
the players themselves – post, email and 
web server play are all catered for. Go to  
www.natcor.org.uk for more information.
So, if you’re fed up of dominating your 
friends and family on the board, it’s time to 
think about finding some real competition 
– and you can bet there’s a thriving chess 
club in your local community that will 
allow you to do just that.
Online clubs –
if in doubt, play online!
If all else fails and you can’t find a decent local chess club to join – or if you wish 
to broaden your playing experience still further – then you could consider joining 
an online chess club. The Internet Chess Club (ICC) is a commercial chess server 
dedicated to the play and discussion of chess and its variants and a place where 
beginners and grandmasters alike congregate online to pit their wits against other 
players. Boasting over 30,000 members, the ICC was the first and largest pay-to-play 
chess server and comes with a raft of benefits to entice new members. For example, 
it offers unlimited rated and unrated play against opponents of all levels, a clear and 
concise way to measure your progress and improvement as a player, and the facilities 
to chat with your opponent and discuss game strategy with fellow observers of the 
games you are watching. You can sign up to three-month, six-month, one-year and 
three-year membership to the ICC (from £15.95/$24.95 up to £120/$197.95), but best 
of all you can try it for free for a month to see how you like it.
There are plenty of other good online alternatives too. As mentioned earlier in 
this book, chess.com allows you to play for free against friends or the computer and 
also offers plenty of insight into how to improve your game in the form of a tactics 
trainer and tutorial videos from the top players. Another good online option is Spark 
Chess (www.sparkchess.com), a free-to-play Flash chess game that offers up a wide 
range of computer-controlled characters to suit your ability. So, as you see, there are 
plenty of online options available and a simple web search will undoubtedly throw 
up many more possibilities as well, to help you find your ideal environment and 
online chess interface.
CHESS APPS 
Thanks to the smartphone and tablet revolution, app-based chess games are also a great 
alternative to help you broaden your skill set and improve your game. A quick search in the 
Apple App Store or Google Play Store (depending on your device) reveals a wide range of 
free and paid-for chess apps that let you play or gain knowledge from the experts. And don’t 
forget good old YouTube: a search through the millions of videos available reveals a great 
many video tutorials that offer tips and advice on how to improve your game. Whatever 
technology you have to hand, there are always ways to seek chess-related enlightenment, so 
dive in and have fun increasing your awareness of this complex and strategic game.

I
n chess, you have no idea how good 
you are as a player, or how much you 
have to learn, until you go head to 
head with other players – novices and 
Grandmasters alike. Unless you are a 
member of a club or have friends who play, 
you perhaps don’t get many opportunities 
to play against other human opponents. 
But the good news is that there are 
numerous online chess sites that allow you 
to play against other people and compete 
in online chess tournaments for free.
But while some players who are 
new to tournament play may feel a 
bit overwhelmed by the rules and 
requirements of the format, it is actually 
very simple to get into, regardless of ability 
level. Essentially you are just sitting down 
and doing what you know and you needn’t 
worry about the other players getting 
annoyed if you mess up and gift them an 
easy victory, because they won’t care! Any 
experience is good experience to take into 
the next game, so just enjoy playing.

Some sites will notify you when a tournament is about to begin, 
so you can get comfy and mentally prepare. It’s always good to 
spend downtime studying other players’ games, though…
04: During the tournament You’ll be 
surprised how quickly you relax and get into your game. Simply 
click and hold on a piece and then drag it to the intended 
position. The game itself won’t let you perform illegal moves.

Fairy pieces
Some variants include “fairy 
pieces”, which move differently 
to standard pieces. For example, 
a princess piece (also known as 
cardinal or archbishop) is able 
to move as either a bishop  
or a knight.
Y
ou might think that chess is chess, with a rigid set of rules 
and pieces, but you’d be wrong. In fact, it’s estimated that 
there are over 2,000 variations on chess out there. Some 
of these variations are quite simple ones, based on changing the 
starting positions of the major pieces – four notable examples are 
listed opposite, including Bobby Fischer’s chess960. Other, more 
extreme, chess variations alter the composition and number of 
pieces on the board, perhaps to balance out different levels of 
experience between players or to encourage different kinds of 
tactical play.
Chess originated somewhere in Asia before the year 500 CE and 
many regional variations have proved popular in different parts 
of the world – turn the page to discover how to play one of the 
oldest recorded forms of chess, a precursor to the modern game.
These variations are just the tip of the iceberg – you can play 
variations on different boards, such as the 3D board made famous 
in Star Trek, play with strange rules (try Absorption chess where 
a piece gains the abilities of any pieces it captures), play multiple 
moves per turn and set up multiplayer games. It seems the only 
limit to chess variations is your imagination!
Chess variants
If the standard board and rules of chess feel constricting, why not try a 
chess variant instead? There are plenty to choose from

Chess for Beginners  131
Mongredien chess This variation sees the queen’s 
knight switched with the king’s bishop so that both bishops are 
on the queen’s side and both knights are on the king’s.
Upside-down chess Black and white pieces are 
switched on the board, effectively leaving each pawn one move 
away from promotion. You’ll need plenty of spare queen pieces!
Chess960/transcendental The placement of 
major pieces is randomised at the start, with your opponent’s 
either mirroring your own (chess960) or not (transcendental).
Pre-chess The game begins with each player taking turns 
to place their major pieces on an empty rank 1. Once complete, 
the game begins as normal.
These games use standard chess rules, but allow you to mix up the starting positions of your major 
pieces to negate knowledge of opening moves

Endgame chess Both players start with just the full 
set of pawns and their king. Standard rules apply for en passant, 
check, checkmate and pawn promotion.
Peasants’ Revolt This variant sees the white king and 
eight pawns (the peasants) face off against the black king, pawn 
and three or – less balanced – four knights (the nobles).
Dunsany’s or horde chess One side starts with 
the standard pieces, while their opponent uses 32 pawns – take 
all the pawns before they run out of legal moves to win.
Handicap chess This form of chess simply allows a 
stronger player to give up an agreed number of pieces at the 
beginning of the game to try to even the playing field.
These four variants vary the number of pieces for each side, allowing players to experiment with 
tactics and handicaps while playing with standard rules

Other pieces The shah, rukh, faras (horse) and baidaq 
(pawn) work identically, but the baidaq cannot move two squares 
initially, and can only be promoted to a firzan (the then queen).
Game layout The starting layout is identical to chess 
except the two shahs (kings) and firzans (queens) can swap 
positions, so long as they face their opposite number.
Pīl (elephant) This piece was later replaced by the 
bishop. It must move two squares diagonally, jumping over 
another piece if required to reach its position.
This precursor to chess first appeared in the historical record around 600 CE, in the Persian Empire, 
and shares many elements with modern chess

T
hroughout the history of chess, 
there are games that stand out 
for many reasons. If you look up 
a list of top chess games, however, you 
will find that experts rarely agree with 
one another as to what should make the 
grade. You will also find that many of the 
games listed tend to be historical rather 
than modern. This is because the older 
games are the ones that introduced new 
and exciting strategies that have strongly 
influenced today’s players. 
In putting together our list of the 
most inspirational chess games for these 
pages, we have looked for the ones that 
have introduced new moves, featured 
surprising twists or have simply broken 
new ground. 
Of course, this is just a small selection 
and there are plenty of other amazing 
chess games that we haven’t had space to 
mention here and which any new player 
can look at for inspiration. For example, 
Karpov vs Kasparov in 1985 pitted two 
of the greatest players of all time against 
each other. Kasparov made a brilliant 
23rd move, placing his rook on a square 
that seemed an unusual decision, only 
to be pivotal later down the line. It is 
games such as this that remind us of how 
these chess masters think and plan well 
ahead, predicting outcomes and moves 
that most of us would never be able 
to contemplate.
Take a look at our pick of the top chess 
games ever played and be inspired.

There are videos of these entire 
games played out on a digital 
board on YouTube, along with 
a commentary explaining the 
moves in detail. It is a great way 
to learn tactics and gain a 
deeper understanding 
of the game. 
This game took place in Wijk aan Zee in Holland and is considered 
one of the best attacking games every played. Kasparov (white) 
began aggressively, but Topalov (black) held his own and secured 
a strong position on the board using the Pirc Defence. Kasparov 
started to struggle from moves 14-24, when he fought to keep his 
position. It is move 24 that is the most noteworthy of the game, 
where Kasparov starts a sacrificial sequence, giving up key pieces 
to attack Topalov’s king. Topalov pushed forward, but ultimately 
lost the game to Kasparov’s relentless attack, resigning after the 
44th move.

Held in Hastings, UK, in 1922, this game is considered to be one of 
Alekhine’s most brilliant. Bogoljubov (white) was quickly surprised 
by Alekhine (black), who used the Dutch Defence, a move not 
often seen in tournament games. This set the tone for the rest of 
the game, with black moving forward in an aggressive manner 
and using moves that were unconventional, leaving white often 
being forced into making moves with little choice. Alekhine 
goes through three queen sacrifices throughout the game and 
Bogoljubov resigns after the 53rd move, preventing the creation of 
a fourth queen. 
The Triple Queen Sacrifice  Efim Bogoljubov vs Alexander Alekhine, 1922
The final position of the game, where white (McDonnell) resigns, 
is considered to be one of the most famous ever. At the time of 
the match, La Bourdonnais was considered to be the unofficial 
world champion. The two players met several times in 1834 and 
this game was the 62nd of the entire series. La Bourdonnais sets 
up a powerful pawn centre, activating them after the 23rd move 
where he makes an exchange sacrifice that determines victory in 
the game. The game is also noted for being one of the first to use, 
and therefore popularising, the Sicilian Defence, which is used a 
lot nowadays.

138  Chess for Beginners
IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer and Garry Kasparov met in two 
key matches. The first game in the 1996 match is notable for 
being the first time that a computer defeated a World Champion 
under normal tournament chess conditions. The game opened 
with the popular Sicilian Defence, Deep Blue setting it up playing 
as white. The opening moves had been determined by the IBM 
team, but after Kasparov introduced a new approach, Deep Blue 
began calculating the moves needed to win. Kasparov tried a late 
game attack from move 30, but Deep Blue rose to the threat and 
Kasparov eventually resigned.

Deep Blue vs Kasparov  Deep Blue vs Garry Kasparov, 1996
This game is known as the Immortal Game because of the way 
that Anderssen (playing as white) made numerous sacrifices 
throughout of key pieces and yet still went on to be victorious. 
The game was part of the first international chess tournament in 
London. It begins with the King’s Gambit, which was a popular 
move back in the 19th century but is less popular now since 
better defensive techniques are usually employed in modern 
chess. The final board shows that black has more pieces still in 
play, but white maintains the positional advantage and therefore 
gains the win.

Levitsky vs Marshall  Stepan Levitsky vs Frank James Marshall, 1912
This game was played over the internet, where Garry Kasparov 
(white) would play a ‘World Team’ whose moves were determined 
by a vote from over 50,000 people in 75 countries. Kasparov himself 
said that this was ‘the greatest game of chess in history’ and one 
of the most difficult of his career, playing out over 62 moves and 
four months before he took the victory. Previous collaborative 
internet games had presented little difficulty for chess masters, but 
this game was notable for giving a strong tactical and strategic 
challenge due to young chess talents being among the World 
Team and a slower rate of play – just one move a day.

This game was played during the master’s tournament of the 
DSB (Deutschen Schachbund) Congress. Levitsky, playing white, 
was the weaker player going into the game, as Marshall was the 
US chess champion from 1909 to 1936. Therefore, the quality of 
play and the outcome was not what makes this game worthy 
of a position in the top games; it is instead Marshall’s final move 
in claiming victory that stands out. He places his queen in a 
position where three of white’s pieces can attack it; however, 
any continuation of the game after that move would lead to 
checkmate – hence Levitsky resigned the game.

Magnus Carlsen 1990-
Notable games:  
• 2012 vs Viswanathan Anand
• 2011 vs Hikaru Nakamura
• 2011 vs Boris Gelfand 
• 2009 vs Veselin Topalov
• 2004 vs Garry Kasparov 
Born Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen 
in  1990, this young Norwegian 
chess player is the current World 
Champion and the number 
one ranked player in the world. 
Throughout his childhood, Carlsen 
showed remarkable talent with 
intellectual puzzles and challenges 
from a young age. He learnt to play 
chess at the age of five but only 
began to show real enthusiasm after 
learning to defeat his sister and his 
father. He entered the Norwegian 
Chess Championship in 1999, at the 
age of eight, before going on to be 
coached at the Norwegian College 
of Elite Sport by Grandmaster 
Simen Agdestein. He continued 
to enter tournaments in his home 
country and around Europe before 
becoming a Grandmaster himself 
at the age of 13 – the youngest 
ever at the time. He was ranked 
world number one at the age 
of 19 in January 2010, and then 
defeated Viswanathan Anand in 
2013 to become World Champion. 
He defended his title successfully 
in 2014, 2016 and 2018. He also 
currently holds the highest rating 
record of 2882. He is known for being 
a versatile player, using a number 
of different openings to keep his 
opponents guessing. 
Famous  
chess players 
We round up a selection of the most notable chess players of all time with details on 
just what made them so memorable

Chess for Beginners  141
Deep Blue 1996-1997
Notable games: • 1997 vs Kasparov • 1996 vs Kasparov
Deep Blue is famous in the chess world as the first machine to win a game against, and later 
defeat, a World Champion. The computer that won the game was developed by IBM, but it 
started out as a project called ChipTest by Feng-hsiung Hsu, a graduate student at Carnegie 
Mellon University in 1985. A classmate, Murray Campbell, joined the project and both were 
taken on by IBM in 1989 to work for IBM Research. Alongside other computer scientists, the 
chess-playing computer was developed and named Deep Blue. In 1996, Deep Blue went 
up against Garry Kasparov and won the first chess game by a computer against a World 
Champion. Kasparov won overall after defeating the machine in three games and drawing 
in two. Deep Blue was then upgraded and a rematch with Kasparov was held in 1997. This 
time, Deep Blue secured victory in game 6. Though Kasparov claimed that IBM had cheated 
and that there was human intervention, the company insists that human intervention was 
only used between games as per the rules. Deep Blue was retired after the game. 
Garry Kasparov 1963-
Notable games: 
• 2000 vs Vladmir Kramnik • 1999 vs Veselin Topalov • 1999 vs The World 
• 1997 vs Deep Blue • 1996 vs Deep Blue • 1985 vs Anatoly Karpov
Now retired from professional chess, Garry Kasparov famously became the 
youngest chess World Champion in history in 1985 when he was 22 years old. 
Before he left the sport in 2005, he spent 20 years as the world’s top-ranked player. 
He is often listed among the greatest chess players of all time and he held the 
highest recorded rating of 2851 until it was trumped by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. 
Although he is known for his achievements against other truly great chess players, 
he is also notable for his games against computers. He started in 1985 by playing 
32 simultaneous computers, beating them all. He went on to defeat Deep Thought 
in 1989 and Deep Blue in 1996, although in the latter match he was bested in one 
game. He was defeated by an upgraded Deep Blue in 1997, the first time a World 
Champion had ever been beaten by a machine. He also played Deep Junior in 2003, 
which ended in a draw, offered by Kasparov himself. Since retiring from chess he has 
become a speaker and writer for the Russian pro-democracy movement. 
Paul Morphy 1837-1884
Notable games: • 1858 vs Adolf Anderssen • 1857 vs Louis Paulsen
Paul Morphy is often referred to as an unofficial World Champion and is considered the greatest 
chess player of his era. Born in New Orleans, USA, he began playing the game at a young age with 
his family and by the time he was nine years old, he was a chess prodigy. When he was 12, he 
played against Hungarian chess master Johann Löwenthal and won two of the three games that 
they played (and possibly the third as well, although there are disputes as to whether it was a draw 
or not). He graduated from the University of Louisiana with a degree in law in 1857, but was too 
young to actually practise law, so he turned his attentions towards chess. His chess career took off 
in America and later across the world. He decided to go back to law in 1859, but that pursuit was 
scuppered by the American Civil War. His law practice never took off and he retired from public life 
almost completely before dying at the age of 47. He is often described as ‘The Pride and Sorrow of 
Chess’ due to his short but impressive run. 
“Kasparov is also notable for his 
games against computers”

José Raúl Capablanca 1888-1942
Notable games: 
• 1936 vs Ilia Abramovich Kan • 1927 vs Rudolf Spielmann
• 1921 vs Emanuel Lasker • 1918 vs Frank James Marshall • 1911 vs L Molina
José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera was a Cuban who started playing chess at a 
very young age, winning important contests throughout his childhood. He went 
to Columbia University, where he played basketball, until he decided to leave to 
concentrate on his chess playing in 1908. He started to take part in national, American 
and international contests, playing against some of the biggest names of the era, 
including then World Champion Emanuel Lasker, and built up a solid reputation as a 
contender for the world championship himself. It wasn’t until 1921 that he became 
World Champion, winning it from Lasker after the conclusion of World War I. He 
kept the title until he lost it in 1927 to Alexander Alekhine. In active tournament 
competition from 1916 until 1924, he is reported to have not lost a single game, 
which led to his nickname of Human Chess Machine. He is also well known for his 
ability at ‘rapid chess’ and his speed of play felled many an opponent. He wrote the 
book Chess Fundamentals, which is still used by modern chess players. 
Wilhelm Steinitz 1836-1900
Notable games: 
• 1895 vs Curt von Bardeleben • 1892 vs Mikhail Chigorin 
• 1886 vs Johannes Zukertort • 1866 vs Adolf Anderssen 
• 1862 vs Augustus Mongredien
The first undisputed chess World Champion (1886-1894), Wilhelm Steinitz was an Austrian, and 
later American, chess player. He was born in Prague and then studied maths at the Vienna 
Polytechnic. He dropped out of college to pursue his chess career. He is often unofficially 
recognised as World Champion earlier than his world championship match in 1886 after he 
defeated Adolf Anderssen, the greatest world player at the time in 1866. He emigrated to 
the USA in 1883 and became a US citizen, living in New York and changing his first name to 
‘William’. He is known for winning matches, rather than tournaments, and he won every serious 
match he played between 1860 and 1897, with the exception of a world championship match 
and subsequent rematch, where he lost to Emanuel Lasker (also losing his world title). His 
playing style evolved during his career, moving from an attacking style to a new positional style 
of play that he used to defeat his opponents and explained through his writings at the time. 
Emanuel Lasker 1868-1941
Notable games:  
• 1934 vs Max Euwe • 1914 vs José Raúl Capablanca   
• 1910 vs Carl Schlechter • 1907 vs Frank James Marshall  
• 1895 vs Harry Nelson Pillsbury • 1889 vs Johann Hermann Bauer
One of the strongest players ever, German Lasker was World Champion for 27 years. 
He used a ‘psychological’ approach, often using weaker moves to confuse opponents 
and playing in a more modern style than his peers. He was interested in the analysis of 
chess moves and in his lifetime he published chess magazines and books, which proved 
difficult for readers to follow and learn from him, though he did influence later players. As 
a mathematician, he also analysed other games, including bridge, as well as contributing 
to mathematical problems and theories with success; he was also friends with Einstein. It 
was these other pursuits – including an interest in philosophy – that contributed to long 
absences from playing chess. But when he was playing, he was dominant. He easily won 
the world title from Steinitz in 1894 and retained it in a rematch two years later. He won all 
other title contests until he faced José Raúl Capablanca in 1921, relinquishing his title.

Viswanathan Anand 1969-
Notable games: 
• 2013 vs Levon Aronian • 2010 vs Veselin Topalov
• 2006 vs Sergey Karjakin • 2005 vs Veselin Topalov
• 2002 vs Teimour Radjabov • 1995 vs Garry Kasparov
Indian player Viswanathan Anand, aka ‘Vishy’ to his 
friends, was taught to play chess by his mother at the 
age of six, showing great aptitude for the sport. He has 
many accolades to his name, including the youngest 
ever Indian Champion at the age of 16, the first Indian to 
win the World Junior Championship in 1987, India’s first 
Grandmaster and Asia’s first World Champion. He was 
the 15th undisputed World Champion, winning the title 
in 2007 and only relinquishing recently in 2013. He also 
holds titles in rapid chess, in which he is an incredibly 
talented player. This makes him one of the most versatile 
players in modern chess, winning tournament, match 
and knockout format chess. His pace of play is well 
known, with near-blitz speeds in his early games, which 
didn’t slow much as he entered higher-level games. He 
won tournaments around the world until 2008. From 
then until 2013, he saw a slip and didn’t have another 
tournament win until 2013. He lost his title later that same 
year to Magnus Carlsen, who beat him again in 2014.
Bobby Fischer 1943-2008
Notable games: 
• 1972 vs Boris Spassky • 1971 vs Tigran Petrosian
• 1963-64 vs Robert Byrne • 1956 vs Donald Byrne
Bobby Fischer is a legend in the world of chess, being one 
of the competitors in The Game of The Century (so named 
by Chess Review). He played and won against Donald Byrne, 
a leading American chess master, in New York in 1956 as 
a 13 year old, which launched his chess career. He went 
on to play, and win, in eight United States Championships, 
and became the youngest candidate at the time for the 
world championship. He took the title of World Champion 
from Boris Spassky of the USSR in 1972, which attracted 
more than the usual amount of attention due to its ‘Cold 
War’ implications. As well as dominating his peers, Fischer 
invented a chess timing system that is used today, and a 
new variant of chess called Fischerandom (aka chess960) 
where the same chess pieces are used but they are 
positioned in random spaces, with there being 960 possible 
starting positions available. Fischer attracted attention in his 
personal life thanks to his anti-American and anti-Semitic 
comments, which led to his US passport being revoked. He 
eventually became a citizen of Iceland.

speeds in his early games”

Pawn potency Can a pawn capture a piece on its first move?
1: Pawn attacking
Ordinarily, a pawn can capture on its first 
move. In the following diagram, which could 
have happened after the third white move, 
the black pawn can take the white pawn at g6 
with either the pawn positioned at f7 or h7.
2: The initial move
When moving for the first time, the pawn is 
permitted to advance either one or two spaces 
forward. Here, the black pawn(1) on c5 has 
moved two spaces in its first move, but note 
the position of the white pawn at d5.

3: En passant capture
The white pawn is attacking the c6 space, 
but since the back pawn has bypassed c6 in 
moving forward two spaces instead of one, the 
white pawn(1) can still take the black pawn with 
an ‘en passant’ capture.
Yes, although obviously not the first move in the game by the 
player controlling the pawn as it wouldn’t be near enough to the 
enemy piece to take it. Unlike other pieces, pawns may not move 
backwards but they can move one or two spaces forward when being 
moved for the first time. Normally, a pawn captures diagonally (one 
square forward to the left or right). However, an interesting move called 
the ‘en passant’ capture means that if a pawn uses its initial move to 
advance two squares instead of one and in doing so passes over a 
square that is attacked by an enemy pawn, then the enemy pawn that 
would have been able to capture the moving pawn had it advanced 
only one square is permitted to capture the moving pawn ‘in passing’. 
Let us demonstrate…

144  Chess for Beginners

1: Short castling
There are two types of castling – short (on the 
‘kingside’) and long (on the ‘queenside’). In 
both cases the king moves two squares and 
the rook moves either two or three squares. 
This diagram demonstrates white castling 
short (if the white king started on e1 and the 
white rook started on h1).
2: Long castling
This diagram demonstrates an example of 
long castling in the white pieces (if the white 
king started on e1 and the white rook started 
on a1), with the king moving two spaces and 
the rook moving three spaces. The king and 
rook pieces may not capture opposing pieces 
when castling.
King of the castle 
Can a king castle after having been 
in check?
Castling is a special type of chess move 
whereby you simultaneously move your 
king and one of your rooks. The king 
moves two squares towards a rook – on 
the king’s or queen’s side – and that rook 
moves to the square at the other side of the 
king. Castling is not permitted when (a) your 
king has been moved earlier in the game, 
(b) the rook that castles has been moved 
earlier in the game, (c) when there are pieces 
positioned between your king and your rook, 
(d) when the king moves through a square 
that is being attacked by an opponent’s piece, 
(e) if your king is currently in check and (f) if 
your king would be in check after castling. 
Therefore, if your king has been put in check 
in an earlier move but isn’t currently in check 
(and hasn’t previously been moved) then it 
can still be castled.

Pawn promotion
In short, yes. When a pawn reaches its 
eighth rank (the far end of the game board), it 
is immediately changed (or ‘promoted’) into 
the player’s choice of a queen, knight, rook 
or bishop of the same colour – regardless of 
whether the player in control of the pawn 
already has these pieces on the board. 
When a pawn is promoted to a queen, the 
process is referred to as ‘queening’. It is very 
rare that the player promoting the pawn 
would choose to promote to any piece 
other than the highly versatile queen, but 
if this is the case then the process is called 
‘underpromotion’. If the promoted piece is 
not physically available (such as if the queen 
piece of the same colour is still in play), then 
in casual play an upside-down rook may be 
used to represent a second queen.
Is it possible to promote a pawn to a queen if I already have a 
queen on the board? I don’t have another queen piece to use!

What is the best first move?
1: The opening
Here we can see that the white king 
pawn(1) moves two spaces forward to e4 
while black moves its king pawn(2) to e6. 
Subsequently, the best ploy by white is to 
go to d4 on the second move and e5 on 
the third, to go for a space advantage and 
an attack on the king.
2: Pawn chain
As mentioned, moving the white queen 
pawn(1) forward two spaces to d4 now 
completely dominates the centre squares 
of the board and if the black king pawn(2) 
now moves forward two spaces to d5, it 
forms a strong pawn chain (you take mine, 
I’ll take yours).
3: King pin
A logical move now is for the white knight(1) 
to move to c3 since it can cover the pawn 
on e4 from there. However, black can move 
the bishop(2) to b4, successfully pinning 
the white knight to the king. This move 
allows development of another piece while 
restricting white’s movement.
It is hard to define the ‘best’ first move as different openings 
lead to different positions, but many believe that the opening 
period is the most crucial time in the game and can determine 
the winner. The key word when starting a game of chess is 
‘development’ – if you can develop more pieces in the opening 
than your opponent, then you control the middlegame and 
subsequently the endgame, thereby increasing your chances of 
winning with a checkmate. In what is referred to as the French 
Defence Winawer Variation, the opening move sees the white 
king pawn (the one in front of the king) move two spaces forward, 
which is the most common opening move playing in professional 
and amateur chess, and then the black king pawn move one space 
forward. Although this doesn’t control the centre squares as e4 
does, it can lead to numerous strong positions. One way of thinking 
is that subsequently the best ploy by the white player is to move 
to d4 on the second move and e5 on the third move and go for a 
space advantage and an attack on the king. Let’s see how this can 
progress in more detail.

146  Chess for Beginners

Who goes first?
How is it decided who makes the first 
move in a new game of chess?
The rule is that the player with the white 
pieces goes first. In a tournament this is decided 
by the officials (the player mentioned first plays 
white), but in other cases one of the players takes 
a different-coloured pawn in each hand and 
hides them from their opponent and then the 
opponent randomly picks a hand and plays with 
whatever colour they pick.
Does size matter?
Are all chessboards the same size?
Essentially, yes they are the same – in 
terms of the number of squares if not the 
physical dimensions. All chessboards consist 
of 64 squares arranged in two alternating 
colours – light and dark or black and white, 
although the actual colours are often 
determined by the shades of wood used to 
construct the chessboard. It’s important to 
rotate the board to the correct orientation 
before laying out the pieces: the board 
is always arranged so that the rightmost 
square on the row nearest to each player 
is a light or ‘white’ square. The actual size 
of the chessboard is usually chosen to be 
appropriate for the size of the chess pieces 
used, squares are twice the width of the base 
of the pawn – so there is plenty of scope for 
the physical dimensions of the board to vary.
Not in a standard game, since it would be deemed an illegal 
move and you would have to play an alternative. Under standard 
chess rules, a player may not make any move which places or leaves 
their king in check – instead the player must move the king, capture 
the threatening piece or block the check with another piece. However, 
there are some variations of the rules. In Antichess (or Losing chess), for 
example, the goal is for the player to lose all of their pieces, whereas 
in fast chess a player is permitted to leave their king in check – the 
opponent may then claim the win. In informal games it is customary to 
say “check” aloud when entering into a move that places the opposing 
king in check, so the player in check has clear warning that their next 
move should involve focusing on getting their king out of check, but in 
more formal competitions this isn’t a requirement and so it is down to 
the players to know whether they are in check or not.
2: Moving the king
Perhaps the most common way of getting 
a king out of a check position is to move the 
king. Where the king is in check here from the 
black bishop, it can be moved to the indicated 
positions so as not to be in check.
3: Blocking the check
Blocking only works if the checking piece is a 
queen, rook or bishop and there is at least one 
empty square in the line between it and the 
king. In this instance the check can be blocked 
by the rook to c4 or the knight to d5.
1: Capturing the attacking piece
There are three main ways to get out of check. 
The first involves capturing the checking piece 
– either with the king or with another piece. 
Here the white king is in check, but the knight 
can be used to captured the attacking bishop.

Pride before a fall 
I knocked over my king by accident – I haven’t lost the game, have I?
Knocking over a king by accident while 
not intending to does not mean that you 
lose the game – although it depends on 
the circumstances and your opponent. 
When you intentionally knock over your 
king in chess, it usually signifies that you are 
resigning from the game and awarding your 
opponent the victory. However, if you do it 
entirely accidentally then your opponent can 
acknowledge this and you can play on as if 
nothing happened without penalty, but if it 
happens during your opponent’s move then 
you may incur a time penalty. When a player 
knocks down their king with the intention 
of resigning, only to then realise that their 
predicament wasn’t as bad as first feared and 
wishes to continue playing, then it is too late 
and their opponent wins the game.
Stalemate
If I have lost every piece except for 
the king. How many moves do I 
have before a draw can be declared? 
The short answer is 50. If there has been at 
least 50 consecutive moves in which neither 
of the players has moved a pawn and in 
which no piece has been taken, then a player 
can claim a draw when it is their turn to move. 
The rule also applies when both players have 
other pieces besides the king.
Beat the clock   How are chess clocks used?
Chess clocks, or ‘game clocks’, are used 
in tournament chess and consist of two 
adjacent clocks with buttons to stop one 
player’s clock while simultaneously starting 
the other (so that the two clocks never 
run at the same time). The purpose of game 
clocks is to keep track of the total time each 
player takes for their moves and to ensure that 
neither player holds the game up. When a 
game of chess begins, the opening moves are 
often played quickly, leaving the player time 
to consider the more complex moves and 
unfamiliar positions on the chessboard further 
on in the game. If you use a clock while playing, 
it forces you to think in a timely manner, with 
consequences if you don’t. It also ensures that 
both players have equal time to ponder all 
their moves.

clock forces

An unexpected move
What is a zwischenzug?
The German word zwischenzug means 
‘intermediate move’ (‘zwischen’ means 
between and ‘zug’ means move) and is 
applied to chess when someone does 
the unexpected. For example, if a player 
makes a move that threatens or captures 
one of your pieces, instead of countering 
with an obvious like-for-like move (such 
as taking the piece that took your piece), 
you follow up with something even more 
devastating that your opponent won’t be 
expecting. And then, as your opponent 
deals with that move, you follow up 
with the original, expected move. Often 
the ‘zwischenzug’ move will be a direct 
attack on your opponent’s king or queen 
and they, in turn, will be forced to deal 
with this threat, perhaps opening up 
better attacking possibilities for the 
zwischenzug-ing player. Your opponent 
is just as likely to use this tactic, though, 
and so it is good practice to think one or 
two moves ahead to ascertain if there is 
a chance that your king or queen could 
come under threat as a consequence of 
one of your earlier moves.
1: Zwischenzug #1
The expected move is for the black pawn on d5 to capture white’s bishop at e4. 
However, the black queen at d8 instead moves to h4 so that it pins the white pawn at 
f2 to stop it from advancing and also threatens the bishop at e4.
2: Zwischenzug #2
The expected move is for the black queen 
at b6 to capture the white bishop at b4, 
checking the white king at e1 in the process. 
However, the rook at c8 moves to c1 to 
attack the king before the queen at b6 
captures the white bishop at b4.
3: Zwischenzug #3
The expected move is for the black rook 
at a8 to capture the white bishop on b8. 
However, the knight at f6 moves to d5, a 
more threatening and advanced position 
on the board, before capturing the white 
bishop on b8 with the rook at a8.

Your chess 
glossary
Here we explain the meanings behind some 
of the more common terms that you will come 
across while playing chess
Aurora
A
Absolute Pin
This is when the king is pinned and 
cannot legally move (as doing so would 
expose it to check).
Active
This describes a piece that controls a 
number of squares, or a piece that has a 
number of squares available to move into.
B
Backward Pawn
This is a pawn that is in the space behind 
a pawn of the same colour and which 
can’t be advanced or supported by 
another pawn.
Bad Bishop
A bishop that is blocked in by the player’s 
own pawns.
Bare King
This describes the situation when the 
king is the only piece of its colour left on 
the board.
Bishop
Each player begins a game of chess with 
two bishop pieces and they can move 
and take diagonally over any number 
of spaces.
Blitz Chess
This is a game in which all the moves 
must be made within a set time of three 
to five minutes (or certainly no more than 
15) by each player.
Blockade
This describes the obstruction of an 
enemy pawn by placing a piece in front 
of it so that it is unable to move.
C
Castling
This is the only move in chess where 
two pieces – the king and the rook – 
can move simultaneously past each 
other. The purpose is generally to 
protect the king and develop the rook. 
Castling on the kingside is referred 
to as ‘short castling’ and castling on 
the queenside is referred to as ‘long 
castling’; the difference determines 
whether the rook moves two squares 
or three.
Check
This is called when there is a direct attack 
on your opponent’s king. The king that is 
under threat is said to be in check.
Checkmate
This signals the end of the game since 
it means that your opponent’s king is 
in check and they have no legal moves 
available to escape the check. The 
player whose king is checkmated loses 
the game.
Chess Clocks
Two adjacent clocks control the timing 
of chess games and separately show the 
time taken by each player to make their 
moves. After moving, the player hits a 
button, which simultaneously stops their 
clock and starts that of their opponent.
Combination
This refers to a sequence of moves to 
gain the advantage. The moves of the 
opponent are usually forced and the 
term ‘combination’ means that your 
opponent isn’t given many possible lines 
of continuation. In the diagram the white 
player wins with knight to h6(1) (black 
king(2) to h8), queen(3) to g8 (black rook(4) 
takes the queen on g8) and knight(5) to f7.

Chess for Beginners  151
Correspondence  
Chess
A form of chess in which the moves 
are sent by mail. This used to be 
popular in the early-mid 20th Century 
and remote areas.
Counter-Attack
This describes when a player defends 
by attacking their opponent instead 
of making defensive moves; for 
example, when players castle on 
opposite wings and both attack each 
other’s king without defending.
D
Defence
This can refer to an opening move 
played by a black piece, or a move 
or series of moves taken to protect a 
piece or position that is under attack.
Development
When a game of chess begins, this 
refers to the act of moving a piece 
from its original square to make 
it more active on the board and 
therefore developing further across 
the board to the other side.
Discovered Check
This is a discovered attack on a king 
that occurs when a player moves 
a piece, resulting in another piece 
putting their opponent’s king in check 
along a line previously obstructed by the 
piece that was moved.
E
Endgame
This refers to the stage of the game in 
which there are only a few pieces left 
on the board.
En Passant
This is a French term meaning ‘in 
passing’ that allows a pawn that has 
just advanced two squares to be 
captured by an enemy pawn that is 
on the same rank and adjacent file 
(next to it). The pawn can be taken as 
if it had only advanced one square. 
En Prise
This is French for ‘in a position to be 
taken’ and describes a pawn or piece 
that is exposed to captured from an 
opponent and is undefended by another 
piece. In the diagram above, the pawn at 
d4 is said to be en prise.

Fool’s Mate
This is the shortest possible checkmate scenario, as the diagram here demonstrates. The 
white pawn on f2 advances to f3, the black pawn at e7 advances to e5, the white pawn at 
g2 advances to g4 and the black queen advances to h4.
F
File
The eight vertical columns on a board  
(a to h) are the files. In the diagram below, 
all of the pieces occupy the f file.

152  Chess for Beginners
Reference
G
Gambit
This refers to a sacrifice (usually of a 
pawn) used to gain an early advantage in 
space (or time) during the opening of a 
chess game.
Grading
This is a number which indicates how 
likely one player is to beat another. A 
competitive ranking list is based and 
compiled solely on results.
I
Initiative
This describes the advantage that a 
player who is making threatening moves 
has over their opponent, who must 
respond to them. The attacking player is 
said to ‘have the initiative’ and can often 
dictate the turn of play.
K
Key Square
This refers to an important square and/or  
a square that when occupied by one 
side’s king guarantees the achievement 
of a particular goal.
King
A king is the most important piece 
in a game of chess. The object of the 
game is to attack the opponent’s king 
(check) so that it is impossible to escape 
(checkmate). A king can move and take 
pieces one space in any direction.
Knight
Each player starts with two knights in 
a game of chess and they can move 
two squares horizontally and one space 
vertically or two spaces vertically and one 
to the side. 
L
Living Chess
This is a game of chess played with 
human beings as pieces on a giant 
chessboard, a spectacle that has been 
performed since the 15th Century.
M
Middlegame
This refers to a period of the game that 
follows the opening, where strategies are 
formed based on the position and put 
into action.
N
Notation
This refers to the method of writing 
down chess moves. The board is read 
from a8 to h8 and then left by right 
by rank from the black side to the 
white side. The result is then written 
down by hand, with numbers for 
blank squares. When writing notations, 
capital letters are used for white pieces 
and lower-case letters are used for 
black pieces, so the starting positions 
on a chessboard would be written as:  
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/
PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR
O
Opening
This refers to a period at the start of 
the game for the first 12 or so moves. 
Traditionally, the opening ends (and 
goes into the middlegame) when minor 
pieces such as knights and bishops have 
been developed (moved out of their 
starting positions).
P
Pawn
A pawn is the weakest, yet most 
numerous piece in a chess game and 
historically represents the infantry of 
an army. Each player begins with eight 
pawns, one on each square in front of 
the other pieces. During the opening, 
a pawn can move directly forward one 
or two square in its first move (and 
only one square thereafter). Uniquely 
among the pieces, it has a different 
capture movement: it takes other pieces 
diagonally forward one space. While they 
are the lowest-value pieces, pawns can 
prove very useful in a game.
Pawn Chain
This is a locked diagonal formation of 
pawns that is supported by a pawn of 
the same colour diagonally behind and 
blocked by an enemy pawn directly 
ahead. The following diagram illustrates 
this formation. 
Pin
This is a term used when a piece does 
not move because to do so would 
expose a more valuable piece to capture. 
It is therefore ‘pinned’ to its position. 
Promotion
This is what happens when a pawn 
reaches the eighth rank (the far side of 
the chessboard). When this happens, 
the pawn can be exchanged for a more 
valuable piece of the same colour – 
usually a queen but sometimes a rook, 
bishop or knight.

Q
Queen
The queen is the most powerful piece in 
a game of chess since it can move any 
number of squares vertically, horizontally 
or diagonally – and capture anything in 
its path.
R
Rank
This refers to the eight horizontal rows 
on a chessboard, which are labelled from 
1 to 8, starting from the white side of 
the board.
Rook
Each player starts the game with two 
rooks, one in each of the corner squares 
on their side of the board, and they can 
move any number of squares horizontally 
or vertically.
S
Sacrifice
This refers to the intentional loss of a 
piece in order to gain a more important 
advantage (and often forms the start of 
a combination).
Stalemate
This is a situation in a game of chess 
when the player whose turn it is to move 
has no legal moves and their king is 
not in check. A stalemate results in an 
immediate draw.
Underpromotion
This is when a pawn reaches the far side 
of the board and, rather than a queen, 
the player chooses to promote it to a 
bishop, rook or knight.
Z
Zugzwang
This refers to when a player is put at a 
disadvantage by having to make a move.
Zwischenzug
This is an ‘in between’ move where a 
player, instead of playing the expected 
move, first performs a move which the 
opponent must answer, before then 
making the expected move.

This is when you arrive at the same position 
from a different sequence of moves.
U
Undermining
This refers to a chess tactic whereby a 
defensive piece is captured, leaving one 
your opponent’s pieces undefended.
Scholar’s Mate
This is a four-move checkmate scenario, as demonstrated on the following diagram. The 
move starts with the white pawn on e2 advancing to e4, followed by the white queen 
advancing to h5 and the white bishop advancing to c4, and ends with the queen taking 
the black pawn on f7 and checkmating.

Openings & 
Defences
When studying chess, you will come across many  
different openings and defences: sequences of moves.  
We look at some of the most common 
Top tip
Chess notation
We have used standard chess 
notation. The white move is listed 
first, followed by black. The square 
being moved to is in lower case 
and the letter before it shows the 
piece (pawns have no letters), 
ie e4, is pawn to e4; Bb5 is 
bishop to b5. 
Sicilian Defence
1. e4, c5
When white opens with King’s Pawn (e4), this is 
one of the most popular continuations and the 
one that’s the most effective for black in terms 
of success rates. Black moves pawn to c5 to 
gain a hold on the centre of the board, which 
white has tried to claim, although it doesn’t give 
black as many opportunities as white in terms 
of developing the other pieces and subsequent 
moves. Around a quarter of all games start with 
the Sicilian and it is still commonly seen in chess 
master tournaments and games.

King’s Pawn
1. e4
One of the most popular opening moves is 
white pawn to e4, which opens up a path for 
the bishop and queen to move, giving multiple 
options on how to proceed. It has a reasonable 
rate of success for white (54.25%), though 
there are other moves with a higher rate. Lots 
of openings will use this starting move. There 
are lots of popular continuations to this move, 
with the Sicilian Defence being one of the most 
commonly used (see below), though there are 
numerous variations to choose from.

Queen’s Gambit
1. d4, d5   2. c4
The Queen’s Gambit is one of the oldest chess 
openings, mentioned in writings from the 
1490s. It wasn’t particularly popular as a move 
back in those early days, but it did have a peak 
in the 1920s and 1930s. These days it is still a 
solid opener and many chess masters still use 
it on a regular basis. The aim of the move is 
for white to gain dominance over the centre 
of the board, moving two pawns into position 
and threatening the sole black pawn, making it 
quite an aggressive stance for the white player.

King’s Gambit
1. e4, e5   2. f4
This was the most popular opening in the 
1800s, though it is rarely used by chess masters 
today. It begins with the King’s Pawn move 
(e4) with the black defence move as pawn to 
e5. This is continued by white with pawn to 
f4. The opening then splits into two branches 
depending on whether black takes the white 
pawn on f4 or not: King’s Gambit Accepted and 
King’s Gambit Declined. Usually acceptance is 
considered the better move, though there are 
numerous variations of both approaches.

Ruy Lopez
1. e4, e5   2. Nf3, Nc6   3. Bb5
This is another classic opening also known 
as the Spanish. Named after a 16th Century 
Spanish priest, it has numerous variations. It 
begins with the King’s Pawn opening move 
(e4), countered with a black pawn to e5 (as in 
the King’s Gambit). White moves its knight to f3, 
followed by the black knight to c6. Finally, white 
moves its bishop to b5 – it is then in position to 
attack the black knight that is protecting the e5 
pawn. The most common defence to use for 
this is the Morphy Defence (see below). 
Morphy Defence 
1. e4, e5   2. Nf3, Nc6   3. Bb5, a6
This defence is named after chess master Paul 
Morphy and it is used in 75 per cent of games 
that open with Ruy Lopez. After white has 
moved its bishop to b5, ready to attack the 
knight on c6, black moves its pawn to a6. This 
forces white to make a decision. It it doesn’t 
move its bishop, it can then be taken by the 
pawn; if it does take the black knight, it can 
also then be captured. So white is forced to 
sacrifice or retreat, thereby strengthening black’s 
position on the board. 
Italian Game 
1. e4, e5   2. Nf3, Nc6   3. Bc4
Strictly speaking, the Italian Game refers to a 
group of openings that all start in the same 
way, but here we’ll look at the first three sets 
of moves that characterise the family. One of 
the oldest recorded chess openings, it can be 
traced back to the 16th Century. It starts with 
a classic King’s Pawn opening (e4), followed by 
black pawn to e5. White moves knight to f3 and 
black responds with knight to c6. Finally, white 
moves bishop to c4, which is the defining move 
of the Italian Game and is an aggressive play.

King’s Indian Defence 
1. d4, Nf6   2. c4, g6
The Indian Defence is a set of chess openings 
that start with white pawn to d4, then black 
knight to f6. A number of openings move 
on from this, including King’s Indian. This is 
considered a modern set of moves, as it gives 
white control over the centre of the board 
deliberately. The King’s Indian kicks in with 
pawns to c4 and g6. This sets the board up 
with white very much in the centre. White then 
usually plays knight to c3 or f3, or pawn to g3. 
The defence is when black plays bishop to g7.
Caro-Kann Defence 
1. e4, c6
Common against the King’s Pawn opening 
(e4), it involves moving the black pawn to 
c6, which staggers play across the board. 
The move is named after two chess players, 
Englishman Horatio Caro and Austrian Marcus 
Kann, who analysed the move in 1886. There 
are many ways to continue from this opening, 
but the most common is d4, d5. White wins 
most games that start like this, but a draw is 
also a high possibility. Statistically, black wins 
less than a quarter of the time.
Queen’s Pawn
1. d4
This refers to any game that starts with white 
pawn to e4 – only second in popularity to 
King’s Pawn. In more recent times ‘Queen’s 
Pawn’ has been used to refer to a game that 
opens ‘1. d4, d5’, but there are variations where 
the initial white pawn move is followed up by 
different pieces by black, such as the Indian 
Defence games and the Dutch Defence. 
Historically, King’s Pawn was a preferred 
opening, but the Queen’s Pawn started to 
become more popular from the 20th Century.

French Defence
1. e4, e6
This is a response to the usual King’s Pawn 
opening (e4). Rather than black pawn to e5, as is 
common, it moves to e6. It is known for creating 
a solid game for black, but doesn’t enable it to 
open its pieces up much in the earlier stages 
of the game. The game can then progress in 
a number of different ways, though the most 
common is white pawn to d4 and black pawn 
to d5, followed by white pawn to e5. After the 
French Defence opening, however, there are 
many alternative variations that can be followed.

Réti Opening
1. Nf3, d5   2. c4
Like the English, this is a flank opening and it is 
one of the few that doesn’t start with a pawn 
move. Instead, white moves knight to f3. Black 
follows with pawn to d5 and white counters 
with pawn to c4. By moving the knight first, 
white entices black to make a move for the 
centre squares so that it can make its own 
attack on the middle of the board from the 
flanks. Named after Czech player Richard Réti, 
it is considered ‘hypermodern’ – a school of 
chess that developed after World War I. 
Pirc Defence 
1. e4, d6   2. d4, Nf6   3. Nc3
This is named after Vasja Pirc (1907-1980), a 
famous Yugoslavian/Slovenian chess player. 
The move was first chronicled in 1887. It is, 
however, considered a more modern defence 
for the King’s Pawn opening (e4) and it builds a 
strong centre for white. Black’s defence instead 
works from the flanks, waiting to attack the 
white stronghold. It was rarely used historically 
and many modern players find it too risky as 
the power remains with white for many of the 
opening moves of the game. 
English Opening 
1. c4
Another common single-move opening, but 
not as popular as King’s Pawn or Queen’s 
Pawn. It’s a ‘flank opening’, where white moves 
an off-centre pawn to start. It dates back to 
1843 when English player Howard Staunton, 
an unofficial world champion, first played 
it during a match with Saint-Amant – and 
again in London 1851 at the first international 
tournament. It can be followed by a range 
of black moves including c5 (a Symmetrical 
Defence) or e5 (a Reversed Sicilian).

Queen’s Indian Defence 
1. d4, Nf6   2. c4, e6   3. Nf3, b6
This is a defence to the Queen’s Pawn. It is 
similar to other Indian Defences in that black 
tries to assert control over the centre of the 
board using higher-value pieces. It also makes 
the game develop quickly, which could 
unnerve an opponent trying to dominate the 
centre of the board from the start. In terms of 
winning, however, this particular opening ends 
in a draw more often than it does an outright 
win, as both players are trying to dominate. It is 
a good move for black, though.

Scandinavian Defence 
1. e4, d5
Also known as the Center Counter, it is among 
the oldest chess openings on record. It’s an 
‘asymmetric’ defence where white moves 
pawn to e4, then black to d5. It isn’t used that 
much at high-level tournaments any more, but 
is considered a good move for beginners to 
learn. While it has a strong record of wins for 
white, some great chess players have used it 
on occasion with success, such as Capablanca 
and Alekhine. The normal continuation for 
white is to capture the black pawn. 
Giuoco Piano 
1. e4, e5    2. Nf3, Nc6    3. Bc4, Bc5
Italian for ‘quiet game’, it is thought to be the 
oldest recorded opening. It builds up tension 
in the middle of the board and isn’t actually 
all that ‘quiet’! It begins in the same manner 
as Ruy Lopez, with the King’s Pawn move (e4) 
and a symmetrical counter (black pawn to e5), 
followed by knight to f3. Black also moves its 
knight in an attempt to march on the middle 
of the board (to c6), but white plays its bishop 
to c4 to prevent black from advancing. Black 
counters with its own bishop to c5. 
Dutch Defence
1. d4, f5
This is a popular defence to Queen’s Pawn 
(d4) with an asymmetrical move by black to 
f5. It is considered risky, as it weakens the black 
kingside while making a claim on the centre 
of the board. So it’s not often seen in high-
level tournament matches, though it has been 
used by masters, such as Paul Morphy, with 
success. It reached a peak of use in the 1950s, 
but is now rarely seen. There are a number of 
possible continuations for white: traditionally 
pawn c4 or more commonly pawn to g3.

Alekhine’s Defence 
1. e4, Nf6
A defence for King’s Pawn (e4), this is named 
after the great Alexander Alekhine who used 
it in Budapest in 1921. Black makes no claim 
on the centre of the board (with knight to f6), 
hoping to draw white forward early on so it 
can form an attack later in the game. It is often 
used by aggressive players, but is not currently 
that common in high-level tournaments, 
going in and out of fashion. It produces strong 
results for both black and white in terms of 
wins, and just as often ends in a draw.

Chess for Beginners  159
Benoni Defence 
1. d4, Nf6   2. c4, c5   3. d5
A version of the Indian Defence, it starts 
with the white pawn to d4, black knight to 
f6 opening. White counters with pawn c4, 
mirrored by black with c5. White finishes the 
opening sequence with d5. There are many 
variations and continuations of the Benoni 
Defence. Depending on black’s counter-move 
to the white pawn to d5, it can become the 
Czech Benoni (pawn to e5) or a Modern 
Benoni (e6). Black may also sacrifice a pawn 
(b5), which is called a Benko Gambit.
Catalan Opening  
1. d4, Nf6   2. c4, e6   3. g3
The play order listed here is the most common 
instance of the Catalan, but there are several 
different moves that can all result in it. The 
opening is a variation of the Indian Defence 
(d4, Nf3). White moves its pawns to the centre 
to show a hold, but it also opens up a possible 
exit for a bishop to make a later play in the 
centre. This kind of prolonged attack is known 
as a ‘hypermodern’ approach, as players hold 
back on a strong centre attack. It is enjoying 
some popularity at the moment.
Grünfeld Defence 
1. d4, Nf6   2. c4, g6   3. Nc3, d5
This moves on from the King’s Indian Defence. 
The first two moves are the same, opening 
with the Indian Defence (d4, Nf6), then c4 
and g6. The Grünfeld Defence kicks in with 
white knight to c3, then black pawn to d5. It 
was made popular after Ernst Grünfeld played 
it successfully against Alexander Alekhine at 
Vienna in 1922 and is still used in championship 
matches. It can develop in a number of ways, 
including the Exchange Variation (white takes 
d5, followed by black capturing d5). 
Scotch Game
1. e4, e5   2. Nf3, Nc6   3. d4
This is often used as an alternative to Ruy 
Lopez to try to catch out black. It follows the 
same first two moves, but instead of moving 
bishop to b5, and usually triggering the 
Morphy Defence, white moves pawn to d4. It 
is an aggressive opening that sees white take a 
strong central stance. It is used by some of the 
top chess players in the world and is currently 
undergoing a resurgence in popularity. It is a 
game worth studying by both black and white 
alike, as it gives opportunity to both players.

INTRODUCTION 


Chernyshevsky, What Is to Be Done? 


and the Russian Intelligentsia 


Michael R. Katz and William G. Wagner 


If one were to ask for the title of the nineteenth-century Russian novel 
that has had the greatest influence on Russian society, it is likely that a 
non-Russian would choose among the books of the mighty triumvirate— 
Turgenev, Tolstoy, or Dostoyevsky. Fathers and Sons? War and Peace? 
Crime and Punishment? These would certainly be among the suggested 
answers; but . . . the novel that can claim this honor with most justice is 
N. G. Chernyshevsky’s What Is to Be Done?, a book few Western readers 
have ever heard of and fewer still have read. Yet no work in modern 
literature, with the possible exception of Uncle Tom's Cabin, can compete 
with What Is to Be Done? in its effect on human lives and its power to 
make history. For Chernyshevsky’s novel, far more than Marx's Capital, 
supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Rus- 
sian Revolution.’ 


From the moment of its first appearance in 1863, What Is to Be 
Done? provoked bitter controversy. Its author, Nikolai Gavrilovich 
Chernyshevsky (1828-1889), had already achieved considerable influ- 
ence and notoriety as one of Russia's earliest advocates of materialist 
philosophy, socialist political economy, and women’s liberation. The 
novel’s extraordinary impact, however, derived chiefly from the solu- 
tions it proposed for Russia’s social ills and for the problems that 
agitated the intelligentsia from the mid-nineteenth century onward. 
Condemning the patriarchal and authoritarian nature of family, social, 
and political relations as the principal source of Russia’s social ine- 
quality, oppressiveness, and economic backwardness, Chernyshevsky 
rejected moderate reform as an ineffectual and morally bankrupt 
means of overcoming these problems. In the more radical program he 
offered, intellectuals would play an active role in social development

and moral regeneration. Blending traditional Russian values and in- 
stitutions with ideas derived from Western European social and politi- 
cal critics, he argued forcefully that individual self-realization, sexual 
liberation, and an economy that combined prosperity with social jus- 
tice could be achieved only through the reorganization of the family, 
society, and means of production in accordance with cooperative 
principles. Armed with scientific education, “new people’—socially 
aware and morally strong individuals—would lead this process of 
reorganization, particularly by enlightening others and_ providing 
models for emulation. 


State, Society, and the Intelligentsia 


This call to action appealed particularly to the younger generation 
of the intelligentsia, a small but articulate group of critics of the exist- 
ing regime who strongly influenced both late imperial Russian and 
early Soviet history. Attempts to define the intelligentsia have varied 
widely; some have emphasized the sociological process of education, 
others the formulation of ideological beliefs antipathetic to autocracy, 
and still others the psychological experience of alienation as the crit- 
ical element in the formation of this group.2 While none of these 
approaches by itself can explain such a complex phenomenon, each 
illuminates an important aspect of the intelligentsia. For these edu- 
cated—often highly educated— individuals who believed in the trans- 
formative power of knowledge and ideas saw themselves, and were 
perceived by their opponents, as a distinct social group dedicated to 
fundamental changes in both the tsarist political system and the 
structure of Russian society. 

This sense of mission as well as of alienation from the state and the 
rest of society arose from several important social and cultural 
changes that occurred in Russia from the early nineteenth century. 
Chief among them was the growth of an educated elite, which by 1860 
still numbered only about 20,000 in a total population of over 60 mil- 
lion. To meet the need for technically more proficient and more

effective officials, the state steadily expanded the system of secondary 
and higher education, drew heavily on Western European specialized 
literature in revising academic curricula, and gradually increased ac- 
cess to higher education for people outside the nobility. But this edu- 
cational process produced not only more professional and loyal, albeit 
often reform-minded, bureaucrats; it also expanded Russia’s tiny liter- 
ary elite and fostered a professional elite whose members frequently 
sought to work independently of the state toward an avowed goal of 
social progress. Encouraged by their training as well as by the state to 
employ their expertise to solve society’s problems, members of these 
elites used their knowledge of Western European institutions, condi- 
tions, and ideas to decry both the injustices, oppressiveness, and 
backwardness of Russian society and the inability or refusal of the 
tsarist regime to ameliorate this situation.* 

Many members of Russia’s emerging educated elite thus found 
themselves alienated from the tsarist state as well as separated from 
most of Russian society by their education and their disdain for tradi- 
tional values and relationships. The anomalous social position oc- 
cupied by the intelligentsia, and indeed by the educated elite in gener- 
al, intensified this dual alienation. As long as the intellectual and 
socio-political elites had coincided roughly in the nobility, the prob- 
lem of defining the status of intellectuals within the traditonal social 
order remained muted. But once educated Russians began to identify 
themselves more as intellectuals or professionals than as members of 
a traditional social estate, they needed to redefine their social role and 
status in different terms. This need grew stronger as the access of 
nonnobles to higher education increased after the 1850s and as many 
nobles left their estates for the cities after the emancipation of their 
serfs in 1861.5 In an important sense, the various ideologies, programs, 
utopias, and conspiratorial groups devised by the intelligentsia repre- 
sented attempts to fulfill this need. By formulating programs for social 
development which enabled them to play an integral part in overcom-

ing Russia's poverty, oppressiveness, and backwardness, the intelli- 
gentsia provided itself with a social role that seemed to reintegrate it 
into society as spokesman, conscience, or guide. While drawing heav- 
ily on Western European social, political-economic, and philosophical 
ideas in formulating these programs, the intelligentsia assimilated 
them into a Russian cultural context that emphasized paternalistic 
control on the one hand and personal fulfillment through service to 
the community, especially to its weaker members, on the other Per- 
sonal interest, social idealism, intellect, and cultural experience thus 
combined to produce in the intelligentsia a fervid, often self-sacrific- 
ing, and potentially authoritarian commitment to social transforma- 
tion in accordance with an idea frequently carried to its logical ex- 
treme. 

The sociopolitical order that Chernyshevsky and his fellow intel- 
ligenty hoped to transform consisted in 1860 of an overwhelmingly 
illiterate and poor peasant agrarian society dominated socially by a 
thin layer of serf-owning noblemen and ruled politically by a legally 
unlimited autocrat. Though the nobles provided the majority of state 
officials, they remained divided socially, ethnically, and regionally and 
depended on the autocracy for income, status, and the preservation of 
their principal economic asset, the serfs who worked their lands. The 
rest of society was divided into a variety of legal estates— merchants, 
clergy, taxed urban groups, cossacks, foreign settlers, state peasants, 
and so on—defined by their relative privileges and obligations, either 
to each other or, primarily, to the state. Reinforcing and reflecting this 
hierarchical sociolegal order were the unequal relations based on gen- 
eration and gender which predominated within families, peasant 
communities, and most other social groups. Women were subordi- 
nated legally and usually factually to men at every social level and 
were excluded from most occupations outside of the home, the fam- 
ily’s farm, or certain menial trades. Religious beliefs, strong especially 
among groups other than the culturally Westernized nobility, rein- 
forced these hierarchical relations and patriarchal values, despite the 
institutional weakness of the Orthodox church. To people engaged by 
ideas and committed to an ideal of social progress that often included 
mobility for themselves, the tsarist order seemed stifling and stagnant. 


6. On the theme of self-sacrificing service in the ideas and self-perception of the 
intelligentsia, see N. Rzhevsky, Russian Literature and !deology:Herzen, Dostoevsky, 
Leontiev, Tolsty, Fadeyev (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1983); B. Engel, Mothers and 
Daughters: Women of the Intelligentsia in Nineteenth-Century Russia (Cambridge: Cam- 
bridge University Press, 1983); I. Paperno, Chernyshevsky and the Age of Realism: A Study 
in the Semiotics of Behavior (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988). The autobiogra- 
phies of women revolutionaries in B. Engel, Five Sisters: Women against the Tsar (New 
York: Knopf, 1975), provide excellent examples of this phenomenon. 


Introduction 5 


But despite this perception of stagnation, pressures for change were 
building throughout the early nineteenth century, not least within the 
government itself. The educational and ministerial systems created by 
the sometime avowedly reformist emperor Alexander I (r. 1801-1825) 
and extended by his successor, the professedly ultraconservative 
Nicholas I (r. 1825-1855), produced a growing coterie of officials com- 
mitted to enhancing Russian power and security through measures 
intended to expand the economy, improve society's welfare, and in- 
crease the bureaucracy’s effectiveness.” With the expansion of educa- 
tion and the development of publishing, some of these measures con- 
tributed to the process of professionalization and the growth of a 
culture of literacy which spawned the intelligentsia. Despite the dead- 
ening effects of state censorship and an official ideology that stressed 
autocratic power, Orthodox religious values, and conservative nation- 
alism, the activities of both statist bureaucrats and critical intellectuals 
extended and strengthened the belief in human reason that had 
gnawed steadily at traditional institutions and values since the time of 
Peter the Great. Other measures helped stimulate a modest yet struc- 
turally significant development of industries employing free rather 
than bound labor and the growth of trade and certain areas of agricul- 
ture. As a result of these developments, the populations of several 
cities expanded dramatically; those of St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgo- 
rod, Kharkov, Odessa, Saratov, Minsk, and some others more than 
doubled from the beginning of the century. Yet despite these 
changes, the overwhelming majority of Russians in 1860 remained 
illiterate and still lived in impoverished peasant villages, the backwater 
gentry estates described so gracefully by Turgenev, or the sleepy pro- 
vincial towns satirized so brilliantly by Gogol. Over a third of the popu- 
lation suffered under the constraints and indignities of serfdom. But 
where capital resources were scarce, communications poor, regional 
trade fairs a principal means of distribution, and even such major 
cities as Kharkov rendered impassable by mud each spring, serfdom 
represented more a symptom than a cause of social and economic 
backwardness. 

Serfdom nonetheless provided the most visible and vexing symbol of 
all Russia's ills for state reformers and critical intelligentsia alike. Its

elimination, both hoped—too optimistically—would open the way for 
rapid development while establishing the basis for a more just society, 
or at least a more tranquil one. Thus when, spurred by Russia’s humil- 
iating defeat in the Crimean War, Alexander II (r. 1855-1881) placed 
emancipation of the serfs at the center of an extensive program of 
reform that also affected the judicial system, local government, educa- 
tion, state finance, press censorship, and military service, one of the 
regime's strongest critics, Alexander Herzen, could proclaim approv- 
ingly from exile in London, “Thou hast conquered, O Galilean!” Cher- 
nyshevsky himself declared enthusiastically that “in comparison with 
the Tsar's program ... all the reforms and improvements carried out 
since the time of Peter seem of little importance. . . . The new life now 
beginning for us will be as much more beautiful, harmonious, brilliant, 
and happy than the former one as the last 150 years have been superi- 
or to the seventeenth century in Russia.”!° For a moment it seemed as 
if the shared goal of emancipation and the process of state reform 
might reconcile the intelligentsia with the autocracy. 

This concord proved short-lived, however, and Alexander’s efforts to 
strengthen his empire through reform paradoxically deepened the 
intelligentsia’s alienation from his regime. To build support for eman- 
cipation, Alexander had relaxed the severe censorship controls that 
had oppressed writers, editors, and intellectuals during his father’s 
reign. A lively public debate ensued in which support for reform pre- 
dominated. But when this debate seemed to the regime to threaten 
public order and the radical press began to demand changes that 
went well beyond Alexander’s limited objectives, the government once 
again tightened censorship restrictions, thereby angering the intel- 
ligentsia. Radical intelligenty denounced the terms of emancipation 
announced in March 1861 as simply the perpetuation of serfdom in a 
new guise, and they reacted equally negatively to the government's 
heavy-handed response to university students’ demands for greater 
autonomy later in the same year. Many, like Chernyshevsky, saw in the 
government’s actions vindication of their belief that the autocracy was 
too imbued with patriarchal values and too closely bound to the priv-

ileged elements in society ever to become an agency for progress and 
satisfactory social reform. Frustrated and embittered, by early 1862 
radicalized intellectuals and students were calling for revolutionary 
upheaval as the only way to effect the great changes in social, sexual, 
economic, and political relations that they believed were necessary 
and possible, if only sufficient will and the right means could be 
found. In their minds, the autocracy had replaced serfdom as the 
preeminent symbol and source of Russia’s oppressiveness and back- 
wardness. 

But while dissatisfaction with Alexander's reforms intensified the 
radicalization of the intelligentsia, this process had actually begun 
several years earlier with increasingly acrimonious disputes within the 
intelligentsia over a series of philosophical, aesthetic, and political 
questions. Initially occasioned by the conflict between youthful pro- 
ponents of materialist and scientistic views and older adherents of 
idealist, chiefly left-Hegelian beliefs, these disputes helped to precipi- 
tate a fundamental split in the intelligentsia between advocates of 
evolutionary reform and those who believed that fundamental change 
could be achieved only by revolutionary means. In these conflicts, 
Chernyshevsky and What Is to Be Done? played a central role in both 
popularizing materialist, positivist, and rational utilitarian ideas 
among the intelligentsia and persuading many of its younger mem- 
bers that radical action was possible as well as necessary. 


The Development of a Revolutionary Utopian 


Chernyshevsky’s background eminently suited him for this role. His 
upbringing, education, and relations with his parents fostered in him 
the intellectual] vigor, commitment to ideas, stern moral integrity, as- 
cetic habits, and concern for the welfare of others that marked both 
his personal character and his developed ideological beliefs. Although 
gifted and self-confident intellectually, however, Chernyshevsky felt 
insecure personally and behaved awkwardly in social situations. To 
overcome his diffidence and shyness, he used his superior intellectual 
abilities to gain recognition, acceptance, and a sense of self-worth. 
Thus from an early age he used his knowledge to help others—his 
schoolmates at the Saratov seminary, the members of the Vvedensky 
circle in St. Petersburg, his students at the Saratov gymnasium, the few 
women with whom he became involved, the readers of his essays and 
articles. Yet his altruism was tinged with paternalism. Convinced of 
the correctness of his views, Chernyshevsky often advanced them self- 
righteously and remained intolerant of criticism. Didactic journalism

proved to be an ideal métier for the brilliant yet insecure son of an 
Orthodox priest who in his life and writings tried to reconcile the 
conflicting tensions between egoism and altruism, Western individual- 
ism and Russian collectivism, scientific discovery and moral certainty, 
and technological change and agrarian harmony. 

Chernyshevsky was born on July 12, 1828, in Saratov, a large provin- 
cial town and trading center of about 50,000 people on the middle 
Volga.!! In typical fashion, his father, Gavriil Ivanovich, had acquired 
his position as priest at the Sergievsky Church on condition that he 
marry his predecessor’s daughter, Evgeniya Egorovna Golubeva. Un- 
typically, the match proved successful, and by all accounts the Cher- 
nyshevskys provided a warm, caring, and secure environment for Nik- 
olai, their only child to survive into adolescence. Indeed, his mother’s 
solicitousness and overprotectiveness may have contributed to the 
extreme self-confidence with which Chernyshevsky later expressed 
his views, even when faced with severe tsarist persecution. His father’s 
approach to his early education undoubtedly also bolstered Cher- 
nyshevsky’s self-confidence while developing his intellectual skill. Un- 
uSually well read in secular as well as religious literature for a pro- 
vincial priest, Gavriil Ivanovich taught his son several languages and 
encouraged him to read widely in the family’s extensive library. This 
process of self-education fostered in Chernyshevsky both an indepen- 
dent mind and a voracious appetite for reading, particularly works of 
or about literature. The family’s modest yet comfortable means rein- 
forced his love of reading, as few resources remained for other diver- 
sions, while the example of his father, a highly capable, hard-working, 
and well-respected cleric, shaped Chernyshevsky’s serious and dili- 
gent approach to his studies. But while this family environment clearly 
nurtured many positive characteristics in Chernyshevsky, its extreme 
closeness and insularity may also have contributed to the social awk- 
wardness and personal insecurity that he exhibited throughout his 
life. 

Chernyshevsky entered the Saratov seminary in 1842, at the age of 
fourteen. He was already more widely read than most of his teachers,

let alone his peers, and proved to be a brilliant student. The resulting 
adulation of his instructors and admiration of his schoolmates un- 
doubtedly strengthened his intellectual self-confidence and sense of 
self-worth, thereby compensating somewhat for his shyness and lack 
of social skills. Chernyshevsky won the respect of his fellow students, 
moreover, by helping many of the less able among them to get through 
their lessons and exams. This altruism toward his peers derived partly 
from his father’s own kindliness and teachings on Christian charity 
and partly from Chernyshevsky’s sympathy for his less fortunate fel- 
low students, many of whom came from impoverished backgrounds. 
But while the sight of poverty, brutality, and social inequality so evi- 
dent throughout Saratov may have incited his compassion, particular- 
ly when filtered through his father’s Christian ideals and the vague 
notions gleaned from such left-Hegelian social critics as Belinsky and 
Herzen in Otechestvennye zapiski (Notes of the fatherland), Cherny- 
shevsky still had not moved very far beyond the orbit of his parents’ 
beliefs. 

This situation changed dramatically with the young man’s depar- 
ture from Saratov in the summer of 1846. He was now eighteen. Believ- 
ing that their son’s scholarly talents would enable him to attain a more 
exalted position than was possible within the clergy, and spurred by a 
dispute between Gavriil Ivanovich and his superiors, Chernyshevsky's 
parents decided to send him to St. Petersburg University. The move 
coincided with Chernyshevsky’s own growing interest in secular ideas 
and in the relationship between literature and society. Moreover, the 
prospect of an academic career excited him. In a letter to his cousin A. 
N. Pypin written shortly after his arrival in St. Petersburg he declared: 


We firmly resolve, with all the strength of our soul, to help end this period 
in which learning has been foreign to our spiritual life, so that it may 
cease to be like a strange coat, a sorrowful, impersonal aping for us. Let 
Russia also contribute what it should to the spiritual life of the world, as it 
has contributed and contributes to political life, emerging powerfully, 
distinctively, redemptively for humanity, in another great field of life— 
learning—as it has already done in one—state and political life. And let 
this great event be achieved, even if only in part, through us! Then we will 
not have lived in this world in vain; then we may view our earthly life with 
tranquillity and tranquilly pass on to life beyond the grave. To help work 
for the glory, not fleeting but eternal, of one’s fatherland and for the good 
of mankind—what can be higher and more desired than that? We pray to 
God He will grant this as our destiny.”

10 What Is to Be Done? 


Clearly, Chernyshevsky saw in the intellect and ideas powerful means 
by which to serve society and, in so doing, to achieve social promi- 
nence as well as personal satisfaction. 

Chernyshevsky’s five years at St. Petersburg University proved pivo- 
tal in shaping the ideas with which he would later attempt to change 
Russian society. Following a pattern typical among university stu- 
dents, he soon grew disillusioned with what he considered to be the 
formalism, intellectual torpor, and, at best, mild reformism of the ma- 
jority of his instructors.13 Though officially a student of literature and 
philology, he devoted most of his time to questions of philosophy, 
political economy, and the social role of literature. With a small and 
changing circle of friends, chosen primarily for their ideas and intel- 
lectual abilities, he followed the exploits of such republicans as Louis 
Blanc during the revolution in France in 1848-1849, explored the 
works of French utopian socialists such as Charles Fourier and his 
disciple Victor Considérant, and debated Ludwig Feuerbach’s mate- 
rialist critique of religion.14 The vibrancy, dynamism, and optimism of 
these ideas could not fail to appeal to idealistic young intellectuals 
such as Chernyshevsky, especially when contrasted with the seeming- 
ly stagnant ultraconservatism promoted even more intensively by the 
Russian government in reaction to the revolutionary events in Western 
Europe.'® Resolving the conflict between atheistic materialism and 
religion proved to be particularly agonizing for Chernyshevsky, not 
least because of its serious implications for his relationship with his 
parents. But attracted by the potential for effective individual as well as 
social action which he saw implicit in Feuerbach’s emphasis on man's 
creative capacity, Chernyshevsky abandoned Orthodoxy for an equally 
holistic materialist world view. His acceptance of the tsarist so- 
ciopolitical order dissolved along with his faith in God. Henceforward 
he advanced, ardently and often intolerantly, the most extreme views 
among the small circle of radical intellectuals gathered around I. I. 
Wedensky, an older ex-seminarian from Saratov who taught literature 
at two military academies in St. Petersburg. But while ruthless in 
debate, Chernyshevsky remained personally compassionate. For sev- 
eral years he helped to support a fellow student whose ideas he ad- 
mired, despite his own meager resources.!©

Introduction 11 


Chernyshevsky returned to Saratov in March 1851 a materialist, 
atheist, and proponent of socialism. Although profoundly alienated 
from the tsarist state and the beliefs of most Russians, however, he had 
yet to challenge the established order openly. Indeed, he had returned 
to his native town partly in response to his mother’s urging but pri- 
marily in the hope of finding more time to complete the master’s 
thesis that he needed for entrée to an academic career, hardly a revo- 
lutionary pursuit. And while testing the boundaries of the politically 
acceptable in his literature classes at the Saratov gymnasium, Cher- 
nyshevsky remained carefully within them. Nor apparently did he 
form close ties with the few political exiles living in Saratov at this time. 
Presaging his later journalistic career, Chernyshevsky limited his revo- 
lutionary activities to teaching his students to think critically, especial- 
ly about tsarist society. 

At the end of his briefreturn to Saratov, Chernyshevsky married Olga 
Sokratovna Vasileva, an event that dramatically affected his life. The 
match at first glance seems an odd one, since Olga Sokratovna’s char- 
acter and interests clashed sharply with those of Chernyshevsky. The 
free-spirited, frivolous, and coquettish daughter of a provincial doctor, 
she proved largely indifferent to Chernyshevsky’s political views and 
social concerns. Materialistic rather than materialist, she seemed to 
gain appreciation of her husband only with his ability to provide for 
her comforts. Not surprisingly, Chernyshevsky’s parents opposed the 
marriage. Yet it satisfied many of their son’s deepest needs. Though he 
sincerely loved Olga Sokratovna, Chernyshevsky also saw in their mar- 
riage an important rite of passage that promised to dispel his social 
awkwardness. “I must marry,” he confided to his diary at this time, 
“also because I will then become a man, rather than the child I am 
now. Then my timidity, shyness, etc. will disappear.”1” Moreover, the 
marriage provided Chernyshevsky with both an excuse to break with 
his parents on an issue other than his religious apostasy and a reason 
to return to St. Petersburg: he had to obtain a position that could 
support a wife and family. Finally, his relationship with Olga Sokratov- 
na enabled Chernyshevsky to substantiate many of his ideas, particu- 
larly in regard to the emancipation of women. Influenced strongly by 
the romantic feminist views of the French author George Sand?8 and 
generally treating people as the reflections of abstract ideas, he pic- 
tured himself as liberating his wife from a confining family situation, a 
view apparently not shared by Olga Sokratovna. He promised and gave 
Olga Sokratovna complete independence and ascendancy in their

12 What Is to Be Done? 


marriage, to the point of living in separate rooms and indulging her 
whims while he himself still adhered to his former ascetic habits. 
Despite his solicitousness, evidence suggests that his wife’s preference 
for material comfort over freedom strained their relationship, especial- 
ly during the early years of the marriage. But even this need to satisfy 
his wife’s desires provided Chernyshevsky with a justification for his 
intense journalistic activity and the consequent neglect of his family. 

As if to emphasize his rejection of his parents’ beliefs, Chernyshev- 
sky defied social convention by marrying Olga Sokratovna only ten 
days after his mother’s sudden death, in April 1853, and quickly de- 
parted for St. Petersburg. Unable to decide between an academic and a 
journalistic career, he barely supported himself and his wife by teach- 
ing, translating popular English novels, and penning literary reviews 
while endeavoring to finish his master’s thesis on the aesthetic rela- 
tions between art and reality. Unexpected talent as a literary critic, 
philosophical and personal clashes with his thesis adviser, and 
chance pushed as well as drew Chernyshevsky toward journalism. 
The popularity of his reviews in Otechestvennye zapiski and Sovre- 
mennik (The contemporary) attracted the attention of the latter’s editor 
and publisher, Nikolai Nekrasov, a radically inclined romantic poet 
who also possessed remarkably good business sense.!9 Nekrasov soon 
offered Chernyshevsky a permanent position on the staff of his jour- 
nal, despite the intense disagreements between the radical young crit- 
ic and the older, more moderate, and philosophically idealist contrib- 
utors to Sovremennik on nearly every subject, from aesthetic values to 
political views. The same disagreements led Chernyshevsky’s thesis 
adviser, the moderate literary scholar and state censor A. V. Nikitenko, 
first to delay the public defense of the thesis until 1855 and then to 
conspire to block conferment of the degree until 1858. Thus effectively 
barred from an academic career, Chernyshevsky had little choice but 
to devote his energies to journalism. His timing proved propitious. 
The death of Nicholas I in 1855, Russia’s humiliating defeat in the 
Crimean War, and the conflict emerging within the intelligentsia over 
philosophical orientation, aesthetic values, and sociopolitical ideals 
together provoked an unprecedented outburst of vigorous and often 
acrimonious journalistic debate that offered Chernyshevsky ample op- 
portunity to fulfill the ambitions revealed earlier to his cousin. 

The ensuing decade proved to be the most intellectually productive 
and socially active period in Chernyshevsky’s life. Indeed, journalism 
suited his temperament, talents, and needs perfectly. While awkward 
and unimpressive in public, in print Chernyshevsky deployed his

Introduction 13 


sharp intellect, a biting polemical style laced with moral fervor, and 
wide familiarity with Western European as well as Russian literature 
and sociopolitical ideas with devastating effect. As a contributor to, 
and then editor of, one of mid-nineteenth-century Russia's most 
prominent “thick journals”—the monthly literary and political period- 
icals that provided the main medium for public discourse at this 
time—he became an influential critic of the injustices and deficiencies 
of the existing order as well as a preeminent spokesman for radical 
social and political change. As Chernyshevsky's popularity grew, sub- 
scriptions to Sovremennik soared, thereby extending the reach of his 
ideas. 

Two principal conflicts, pitting him against both political moderates 
and the tsarist state, shaped most of Chernyshevsky’s writing during 
these years. Concentrating initially on literary criticism, he sought to 
formulate a theory of aesthetics that both embodied his materialist 
and positivistic beliefs and transformed art into a weapon for radical 
social transformation. In thus linking art with social action, Cher- 
nyshevsky reflected a view common among the intelligentsia at this 
time, that literature and literary criticism could serve as powerful 
forces of historical progress. But his extreme assertion—expounded 
most comprehensively in his master’s thesis—that literature should 
be judged solely on the basis of its fidelity to reality and its social 
utility challenged the idealism and aesthetic values of even moderate 
critics of the regime, to say nothing of their aristocratic sensibilities. In 
the ensuing conflict over the nature of art, Chernyshevsky and his 
youthful allies suggested that their critics’ moderation and commit- 
ment to idealism derived largely from a self-interested desire not to 
upset the status quo, while their opponents imputed Chernyshevsky's 
ideas in part to the lack of culture allegedly resulting from his social 
origin and upbringing. Ivan Turgenev, for example, a moderate who at 
the time was the most renowned contributor to Sovremennik, re- 
marked that Chernyshevsky and his supporters “are resentful that 
they were brought up on vegetable oil, and so they arrogantly strive to 
wipe poetry off the face of the earth ... and establish their coarse 
seminarian principles.”2° Clearly social differences as much as philo- 
sophical and aesthetic disagreements shaped the response to Cherny- 
shevsky’s ideas and exacerbated the conflict that was pushing moder- 
ate and radical intelligentsia apart. 

The adoption of a program of reform by Alexander II only widened 
this gulf. Turning from the later 1850s almost exclusively to questions

14 What Is to Be Done? 


of political economy and social theory, Chernyshevsky quickly con- 
cluded that Russia’s social injustices and lack of development could 
not be overcome through evolutionary means, especially reforms un- 
dertaken by the tsarist state. In his view, the relationship of mutual 
dependence between the autocracy and privileged social groups pre- 
cluded meaningful state action until a social revolution had restruc- 
tured political power. Chernyshevsky believed, moreover, that if this 
revolution was to succeed, it would need to overturn the patriarchal 
relations that existed within the family as well as between social 
groups and between the state and society. Thus he became an ardent 
advocate of women’s rights as a means to pursue social revolution 
generally, and thereby helped to raise the “woman's question” in mid- 
nineteenth-century Russia.2! But Chernyshevsky condemned not only 
the inadequacy of the government's proposals. He also harshly crit- 
icized the moderate intelligentsia who supported these proposals and 
again questioned their integrity as well as their intelligence. Moderates 
countered that Chernyshevsky’s radicalism not only was impractical 
but also threatened to frighten the government away from the more 
realistic path of gradual reform and to unleash the destructive pas- 
sions of the still ignorant masses. The break between moderates and 
radicals within the intelligentsia was complete. 

While calling for radical social action over state reform, however, 
Chernyshevsky took care to remain within the boundaries set by state 
censorship and to avoid personal involvement in revolutionary 
activities. Nonetheless, the government blamed the upsurge of revolu- 
tionary and student activism in the early 1860s on the subversive influ- 
ence of Sovremennik and its radical editor. Therefore when Cherny- 
shevsky ignored warnings to moderate the journal’s political line, the 
government reacted to student protests at St. Petersburg University 
and a series of suspicious fires in the northern capital in early 1862 by 
closing Sovremennik in June and arresting Chernyshevsky on largely 
fabricated charges the following month. While imprisoned and await- 
ing trial in the Peter-Paul Fortress, Chernyshevsky produced his last 
significant and most influential work, the novel What Is to Be Done? In 
early 1864 he was convicted of subversion, largely on the basis of false 
evidence, and sentenced to fourteen years at hard labor (later reduced 
to seven), to be followed by permanent exile. 

Chernyshevsky spent the next eighteen years in prison or in exile in 
eastern Siberia, far from his family, friends, or sources of intellectual

stimulation. Isolation, poverty, frustrated hopes, and anxiety over his 
family’s welfare broke his spirit as well as his health. Although he 
continued to write, most of what he produced lacked the sharpness 
and focus of his earlier works. Only the autobiographical novel Pro- 
logue, published in London in 1877, had much literary merit. Olga 
Sokratovna visited him once. But the journey proved so exhausting for 
her that Chernyshevsky forbade her to repeat it and even urged her to 
divorce him in order to find a husband who could offer her more 
security.22 In 1883, having subdued the revolutionary movement of the 
1870s, the government allowed Chernyshevsky to move to the more 
populous and less remote port of Astrakhan, on the Caspian Sea, 
where he lived a relatively lonely existence with his wife for the next 
six years. He was permitted to return to Saratov only in June 1889, four 
months before his death. While the government's harsh treatment of 
Chernyshevsky ended his active career, it also transformed him into a 
martyr and thereby undoubtedly enhanced the appeal of What Is to Be 
Done? It is perhaps fitting that a man who valued the intellect so 
highly and tended to treat people as personifications of ideas became 
himself the mythicized symbol of Russian radicalism. 


The Ideology of a Revolutionary Utopian 


Chernyshevsky’s chief intellectual accomplishment lay in synthesizing 
the ideas of contemporary Western European social critics, political 
economists, and philosophers into an ideology of radicalism that ap- 
pealed to angry young intelligenty caught in the backward conditions 
of mid-nineteenth-century Russia.23 The appeal! of his ideas derived 
both from their successful melding of au courant European theories 
with Russian cultural, especially Orthodox religious, values and from 
the crucial role that they assigned to déclassé intellectuals in the effort 
to overcome Russia's problems. Though he condemned both the 
European capitalist present and the patriarchal tsarist past, Cher- 


22. Prerevolutionary Russian law treated marriage as a religious institution and 
therefore assigned jurisdiction over cases of divorce to appropriate ecclesiastical bodies. 
Although severely restricting divorce, the Orthodox church did allow it in the event that 
a spouse was exiled to Siberia forconviction of a serious criminal offense. See also text n.

teenth to the early twentieth century, see W. G. Wagner, “The Trojan Mare: Women’s

Russia, ed. L.. Edmondson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989).

nyshevsky combined secular ideas with religious values, Western 
European democratic individualism with Russian collectivism and pa- 
ternalism in a way that promised intellectuals self-fulfillment and so- 
cial prominence while still binding them closely to the community. 
Materialist philosophy, utilitarian ethics, science, and technology be- 
came the means through which an educated elite would transform 
traditional social institutions into a prosperous agrarian utopia where 
both the material welfare of the masses and the creative needs of 
intellectuals would be satisfied. Chernyshevsky thus offered an ideo- 
logical vision that promised to resolve the tensions produced by edu- 
cational reform, Western European competition and cultural intru- 
sion, and the advent of secularization and impact of science in a still 
predominantly agrarian Christian community. 

Philosophical materialism provided the foundation for both Cher- 
nyshevsky’s critique of the tsarist sociopolitical order and his optimis- 
tic belief in the possibility of transforming that order through action 
informed by scientific knowledge.24 Influenced strongly by the Ger- 
man materialists Ludwig Buchner and especially Ludwig Feuerbach,?5 
Chernyshevsky claimed that body, mind, and spirit represented mere- 
ly different aspects of a single, unitary human organism that was an 
integral part of nature. Action, thought, and emotion thus were noth- 
ing more than sensual responses to external stimuli and therefore 
were governed by natural laws. Chernyshevsky argued that these laws 
could be discovered by rigorous application to human society of the 
methodology and concepts developed in the natural sciences by such 
pioneers as the French physiologist Claude Bernard.26 Human beings 
would then be able to reshape their social as well as natural environ- 
ment in accordance with their needs. Religious belief and philosophi- 
cal idealism impeded progress toward this end, Chernyshevsky as- 
serted, by projecting a false image of human nature which obscured 
knowledge of reality. Social, political, and religious institutions like- 
wise tended to preserve distorted images of reality in order to protect 
the power and privileges of the social groups that benefited from these 
institutions. For Chernyshevsky, then, human progress required both 
the constant advance of scientific understanding and the elimination 
of those institutions that perpetuated ignorance. 


24. Chernyshevsky's fullest statement of this position may be found in “The Anthro- 
pological Principle in History,” in N. G. Chernyshevsky, Selected Philosophical Essays 
(Moscow, 1953), pp. 49-135. 

25. In his book Kraft und Stoff (Force and matter) (1855), the German physician and 
philosopher Ludwig Buchner provided a materialist interpretation of the universe 
which rejected God and explained both mind and thought as physical states of the brain 
produced by matter in motion. On Feuerbach, see text n. 41.

Introduction 17 


Chernyshevsky's theory of aesthetics, which so enraged his moder- 
ate opponents, followed logically from his materialist epistemology.” 
For him, art represented a medium for revealing, vicariously experi- 
encing, and thereby better understanding reality. Reality itself could 
not be transcended, only comprehended. Idealist notions of pure art 
or beauty therefore were not simply false but dangerous, because they 
obscured reality and subordinated it to an unrealizable ideal. Cher- 
nyshevsky concluded that art should therefore be judged on the basis 
of its fidelity to reality and its ability to expand human knowledge. 
Hence his theory of aesthetics essentially endeavored to transform art 
into an instrument of education. Taking this principle a step further in 
What Is to Be Done?, Chernyshevsky sought not only to explain reality 
but also to change it by providing radical youth with guidelines for 
social behavior and political action. By thus emphasizing in his fiction- 
al as well as his critical writing the need to understand and affect the 
present, Chernyshevsky contributed significantly to the development 
of aesthetic realism in mid-nineteenth-century Russia despite the ex- 
tremeness of his views. 

In addition to materialism, Chernyshevsky also drew heavily on Brit- 
ish utilitarianism to explain human behavior and to refute idealist 
conceptions of morality.28 The resulting theory of rational egoism en- 
abled him to reconcile the individual's need for personal self-fulfill- 
ment with the collective interests of the community. Put simply, Cher- 
nyshevsky argued that all human behavior was motivated by the desire 
to maximize personal pleasure and to avoid pain. Since human 
motivation thus was both constant and universal, differences in the 
behavior of people could be explained only by the different ways in 
which their socioeconomic environment led them to act in pursuit of 
their self-interest. Crime and courage, avarice and charity, all ema- 
nated from the same egoistical impulse. Chernyshevsky concluded 
that religious and philosophical idealist concepts of free will and mo- 
rality therefore could neither explain nor alter human action. “Good” 
and “evil” became relative terms, their use based on whether people 
perceived the actions of others as beneficial or harmful to them; the 
conflict between good and evil simply reflected the clash of interests 
between competing individuals or social groups. We should resolve 
such conflicts by maximizing the pleasure of the largest number of 
people, asserted Chernyshevsky, since that would bring the greatest 
benefit to society. Building on this idea, he added that enlightened 
individuals recognized that the maximization of society's interests 


27. Chernyshevsky gives his fullest statement of this theory in “The Aesthetic Rela- 
tions of Art to Reality,” in Selected Philosophical Essays, pp. 281-422.

18 What Is to Be Done? 


also best served their personal interests because their welfare de- 
pended directly on society's general level of prosperity. Self-interest, 
he contended, therefore led such “rational egoists” to work toward the 
creation of socioeconomic and political institutions that ensured that 
personally pleasurable and socially desirable action coincided for 
each individual. As Christian charity had provided the way to personal 
salvation for his father, service to the community became the way to 
personal self-fulfillment for the secularized son. 

Chernyshevsky based his defense of cooperative socialism as well as 
his critique of capitalist individualism and tsarist patriarchy on this 
theory of rational egoism. Drawing heavily on the work of French 
utopian socialists and British political economists,?® he argued that a 
political economy based on cooperative labor and collective owner- 
ship could satisfy the needs of the individual and society more effec- 
tively than either capitalism or the tsarist order because it would 
channel the pursuit of self-interest toward improving the welfare of 
the group as well as of the self. Economic output expanded more 
rapidly as a result, Chernyshevsky contended, because individuals 
worked more efficiently as a group than they did separately and be- 
cause they worked more productively when they retained the fruits of 
their labor. Indeed, believing that the value of a good derived from the 
amount of labor embodied in it, Chernyshevsky idealized manual la- 
bor and asserted that it provided the chief source of personal pleasure. 
He therefore denounced both capitalism and the patriarchal serf 
economy as exploitive as well as inefficient because they promoted a 
competitive pursuit of self-interest that deprived especially workers 
and peasants of the product, and thus the value, of their labor. Eco- 
nomic productivity consequently suffered because laborers expended 
less effort in their work while the idle rich had to invent unproductive 
pastimes in order to satisfy their need for sensual stimulation. Both 
the capitalist and the tsarist patriarchal systems thus depressed a 
society's overall welfare by preventing the majority of its members 
from achieving their full productive potential. This was particularly 
the case in regard to women, who were prevented under both systems 
from pursuing socially productive and personally fulfilling occupa- 
tions even when their intelligence surpassed that of men. 

In Chernyshevsky’s view, then, the source of Russia's economic 
backwardness and social uppressiveness lay in its patriarchal socio- 
economic and political structures. Socialist transformation of these 
structures promised growth and prosperity as well as personal libera-

tion. Following the ideas of his fellow social critics Alexander Herzen 
and Mikhail Bakunin,2° Chernyshevsky believed that the existence of 
the peasant commune provided Russia with a unique opportunity to 
undertake this transformation directly, without first having to experi- 
ence the evils of capitalism.3! While not idealizing the commune, he 
argued that it could be transformed through advanced European tech- 
nology and science, and through the ideas of such thinkers as Fourier, 
Considérant, and Robert Owen,*? into a highly productive cooperative 
agricultural community. Initially hoping that the state might direct 
this process, Chernyshevsky concluded from the course of emancipa- 
tion that the tsarist regime was imbued too deeply with patriarchal 
values and bound too closely to the landed nobility to promote such 
change. Referring also to the abandonment by French liberals of their 
ideals when faced with the demands of the masses in 1848-1852, 
Chernyshevsky began to assert that political structures in general 
emerged historically as the means by which dominant social groups 
preserved their power and privileges. Since these groups would never 
voluntarily surrender their power, significant social or political change 
could not be achieved through gradual reform, whether promoted by 
the state or by liberals. Hence only a social revolution that destroyed 
patriarchal relations within the family and society and thereby under- 
mined the autocratic political system could clear the way for socialist 
transformation and economic growth. Considering moderates to have 
been too thoroughly seduced by the comforts of the old regime to risk 
real change, Chernyshevsky declared that only the younger, radical 
members of the intelligentsia could lead this revolution and guide the 
subsequent transformation of society. 

The growing influence of natural science and scientific methodol- 
ogy among European intellectuals generally during the latter half of 
the nineteenth century gave Chernyshevsky’s ideas an important ad- 


30. On Herzen, see pp. 25-26 below and n. 9 above. Descended from a wealthy 
aristocratic family, Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876) became a leading exponent of anarch- 
ism in nineteenth-century Europe and participated in revolutionary movements in 
France and Saxony in 1848-1849. Exiled to Siberia for his political activities, he escaped 
in 1861 to London, where his quarrel with Marx helped split the international] socialist 
movement. Perhaps his most famous work is his treatise God and the State (1882). On 
Bakunin, see A. Kelly, Mikhail Bakunin: A Study in the Psychology and Politics of Utopia-

vantage in the ideological conflict that erupted within Russia’s edu- 
cated elite at this time. The apparent objectivity of materialism and 
utilitarianism enabled him to deny the legitimacy of both idealist eth- 
ics and the values underlying existing political, social, and religious 
institutions while simultaneously providing legitimacy to his own ide- 
als in the guise of scientific fact. Yet despite his sincere profession of 
materialism and his pretensions to scientific objectivity, Chernyshev- 
sky remained essentially an idealist. Following the earlier radical Rus- 
sian critic Vissarion Belinskv, for example, he argued that an accu- 
rate depiction of social reality entailed a critique of its injustices and 
an indication of how they could be overcome. Such a critique implied 
an ideal of justice against which to measure reality. Nor did Cher- 
nyshevsky simply explain or describe actions and relationships in 
terms of socioeconomic utility; he also judged them in terms of moral 
categories. Failure to work toward the goals that he defined was not 
merely illogical or inexpedient but also immoral. His utopian vision 
projected a harmonious community where egalitarian and just social 
relations remained unaffected by constant technological change. In- 
deed, this vision appealed to educated young Russians precisely be- 
cause it combined familiar Orthodox Christian ideals with new uto- 
pian socialist and democratic models and invested the amalgam with 
scientific certainty, thereby providing youthful intelligenty with firm 
moral guidelines during a period of social and ideological dislocation. 
The very fact that Chernyshevsky concentrated his efforts so single- 
mindedly on educating this intellectual elite testifies to his belief that 
history was moved at least as much by ideas as by material forces. 
Armed with the proper ideas, these “new people” could reshape ra- 
ther than simply react to the Russian environment, in the process 
creating a society that was more just as well as more productive. 
This combination of moral and scientific certainty helps explain the 
stridency, intolerance, and self-righteousness with which Chernyshev- 
sky promoted his ideas. It also explains the blend of democratic col- 
lectivism and elitist paternalism that characterized these ideas. For 
while extolling service to the community as the path to personal self- 
fulfillment, Chernyshevsky portrayed an elite that served society large- 
ly by shaping it in accordance with the elite’s own view of social 
justice. As a result, much like the Christian precepts from which he 
drew sustenance, Chernyshevsky’s ideas contained the potential for

spoken advocate of radical views as well as Russia's most prominent literary critic 
during the late 1830s and 1840s. Denouncing the idea of “art for art's sake,” he argued 
that literature should comment critically on social and political reality, but without 
sacrificing its aesthetic qualities. For a perceptive essay on Belinsky, see Berlin, Russian 
Thinkers, pp. 150-85.

authoritarianism as well as for liberation. The tension between egoism 
and altruism, evident in his life and explored in his fictional charac- 
ters, thus remained unresolved. 

But if Chernyshevsky was a paternalistic elitist, he was no more so 
than either apologists of the tsarist regime or his moderate opponents 
within the intelligentsia. Indeed, his arguments effectively exposed the 
dilemma confronting Russian moderates, whose ideals also were in- 
compatible with autocracy and alien to the majority of the Russian 
people. Moderates no less than radicals had to destroy the old regime 
and impose their values on the rest of society in order to realize their 
goals. Facing the Scylla of political disorder and the Charybdis of 
social upheaval, they tended to opt for order at the expense of social 
change.*4 In pursuing his ideals, Chernyshevsky at least focused di- 
rectly on the poverty, hunger, and oppression that afflicted the major- 
ity of the population. By doing so from a materialist and scientistic 
perspective, he helped provoke a more sophisticated debate over Rus- 
sia’s economic backwardness by calling attention to the sociological 
and technological sources of this problem. Perhaps most impressive, 
however, Chernyshevsky persuaded the younger generation of the in- 
telligentsia of the possibility as well as the nobility of acting to over- 
come Russia’s social and economic problems. He thereby provided 
déclassé intellectuals with a social role that gave them considerable 
self-esteem regardless of the success or failure of their actions. The 
bible for these radical intellectuals became the novel What Is to Be 
Done? 


The Genesis of a Utopian Novel: 
The Writing of What Is to Be Done? 


What Is to Be Done? represents the best-known and most com- 
prehensive statement of Chernyshevsky’s ideas. Through it he exerted 
extraordinary influence on generations of Russian radicals. The ac- 
tions of these radicals and the reactions of their opponents cannot be 
fully understood without reference to the source that inspired or en- 
raged them. Rakhmetov, the totally rational revolutionary ascetic and 
superhero, makes both Lenin and Dostoevsky more comprehensible; 
Vera Pavlovna, the emancipated woman who tears asunder the con- 
ventional family and the institution of marriage, helps explain both

Sofya Perovskaya and Konstantin Pobedonostsev.35 Moreover, Cher- 
nyshevsky both followed and contributed to a rich Russian literary 
tradition by presenting the major statement of his ideas in the form of 
a novel. Written as a response to Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, What Is 
to Be Done? in turn provoked Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground. 
The book thus represents a major work of Russian literature as well as 
one of the key documents for understanding nineteenth-century Rus- 
sian social and political thought, revolutionary activity, and social con- 
flict. 

Chernyshevsky produced What Is to Be Done? while incarcerated in 
the Peter-Paul Fortress, where he sat awaiting trial as his case was 
laboriously investigated. Prevented from writing any further essays or 
articles, he turned to fiction as a medium for expressing his ideas. The 
novel was not meant as a diversion or as a substitute for more impor- 
tant work. Chernyshevsky explained subsequently to the official Com- 
mission of Inquiry, “For a long time I have planned . . . to apply myself 
to literature. But I am convinced that people of my character must do 
this only in their later years. . . .A novel is destined for the great mass 
of the public. It is a writer's most serious undertaking, and so it be- 
longs to old age. The frivolity of the form must be compensated for by 
the solidity of the thought.”36 Indeed, the protestations of the narrator 
in the novel notwithstanding, Chernyshevsky meant his work to stand 
in the great tradition of Russian literature represented by Gogol and 
Turgenev. 

In late 1862 Chernyshevsky asked the prison commandant for per- 
mission to begin work on a novel. His request granted, he set to work 
and produced the entire novel within four months, between Decem- 
ber 14, 1862, and April 4, 1863. The first part of the manuscript was 
then submitted to the prison censor, who, whether carelessly or for 
devious purposes, passed it and forwarded the manuscript to the 
censor of the journal Sovremennik. Passed again, the novel was sent to

tive views in late-nineteenth-century Russia, Konstantin Pobedonostsev (1827—1907) ex- 
erted a strong influence on state policy as an adviser to Alexander III (r. 1881-1894) and

the journal’s editor, Nekrasov, who promptly lost it in a cab. He man- 
aged to recover the manuscript only after advertising in the official 
gazette of the St. Petersburg police. With what is perhaps the greatest 
irony of Russian letters, the novel that the police helped to retrieve 
turned out to be the most subversive and revolutionary work of nine- 
teenth-century Russian literature. Its publication has aptly been called 
“the most spectacular example of bureaucratic bungling in the cultur- 
al realm during the reign of Alexander II.”37 

What Is to Be Done? appeared in numbers 3, 4, and 5 of Sovremennik 
for 1863, and was published subsequently as a separate volume. A 
rough draft, lacking sections 19-23 of Chapter 5 and all of Chapter 6, 
was discovered much later in the archive of the Peter-Paul Fortress 
and published in 1929. An authoritative version of the novel edited by 
T. I. Ornatskaya and S. A. Reiser appeared in the Academy of Sciences 
Literary Monument Series in 1975. Their text is basically a reprint of 
the original journal version, which was carefully collated with manu- 
scripts housed in the Central Government Archive of Literature and 
Art in Moscow. We have used this edition in preparing the present 
translation. 

Although a number of Western European literary texts exerted a 
significant influence on Chernyshevsky's novel, the works of three 
authors, all mentioned specifically in the text of the novel, merit spe- 
cial attention. First among these writers is the French philosopher 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose novel Julie, ou La Nouvelle Héloise 
(1761) served as one of Chernyshevsky’s most important sources.38 
Rousseau’s Julie d’Etange provided a model for Chernyshevsky’s Julie 
Letellier, the semiliberated French courtesan who acts as a foil for his 
heroine, Vera Pavlovna. And like Rousseau’s Saint-Preux, Chernyshev- 
sky’s Lopukhov is a man of strong character and absolute rationality. 
Most important, Chernyshevsky’s Vera Pavlovna is meant to be per- 
ceived as a new, “improved” version of Rousseau’s Julie. Through her 
character Chernyshevsky sought to show how the ideal of women’s 
equality articulated by Rousseau could be realized in practice. This 
lineage is stated explicitly in Vera Pavlovna’s fourth dream, where 
Chernyshevsky describes Rousseau as the figure who inaugurated the 
“modern phase” of feminism by providing the first model of an intel- 
ligent and independent heroine. 

The novels of the French author George Sand, particularly Jacques

(1834, translated 1844), also strongly influenced the feminist theme as 
well as the plot of What Is to Be Done?° Throughout her works Sand 
emphasizes the primacy of love and the absolute right of awoman to 
achieve romantic fulfillment—if not with her legal husband, then with 
her heart's desire. Thus at the end of Jacques, Sand's hero chooses to 
sacrifice his love for Fernande in order to set her free to love Octave. He 
makes his own suicide appear to be an accident and “quits the scene” 
without remorse. It is particularly notable for our purposes that the 
hero's sister, Sylvia, tries to dissuade Jacques from his chosen course 
by arguing that there really should be something else to life besides 
love. She even suggests to the hero that he start all over again, perhaps 
in the New World. 

While Sand’s heroine may achieve personal fulfillment, however, she 
contributes little to society. So just as Chernyshevsky’s Vera Pavlovna is 
a new version of Rousseau’s Julie, she also represents an advance over 
Sand’s Fernande. Living not for love alone, Vera Pavlovna pursues her 
own course of spiritual and intellectual development. She has her own 
work (organizing sewing cooperatives), which she finally abandons 
only to pursue an even nobler calling, the study of medicine—as many 
“new men” do—in order to achieve complete independence and 
equality. In Chernyshevsky’s view, then, the emancipation of women 
requires both freedom in love and involvement in socially useful labor, 
especially of the type favored by male intellectuals. Indeed, Cherny- 
shevsky considered love and labor to be complementary, with the 
sensual stimulation of the former yielding greater creativity and pro- 
ductivity in the latter. 

By the same token, Chernyshevsky’s Lopukhov represents an ad- 
vance over Sand’s hero. Seeking to extricate himself more rationally 
than Jacques from his own love triangle, Lopukhov stages a fictitious 
suicide. Then heeding Sylvia's advice to Jacques, as it were, he chooses 
to start life afresh in the New World. He later returns to Russia, finds a 
suitable mate, and ultimately settles down to live in complete harmo- 
ny with her alongside Vera Pavlovna and Kirsanov. 

Finally, Chernyshevsky was also influenced by the English novelist 
Charles Dickens’ Hard Times (1854), which he had reviewed in Sovre- 
mennik.4° While appreciating Dickens’ hardheaded realism and biting 
social criticism, however, Chernyshevsky took issue with what he de- 
scribed as the English author's “deviations” from that admirable path: 
his fondness for plots centering on love and sentiment and his re- 
liance on conventional morality and happy endings. Similarities in

Introduction 25 


characters and themes abound between Hard Times and What Is to Be 
Done? Bounderby'’s “rugged individualism” has been transformed into 
the “new men’s” “rational egoism”; Gradgrind’s “heartless utilitarian- 
ism” has been revised, particularly to accommodate emotions; Dick- 
ens’ industrial institutions (coal mine, factory, trade union) find their 
counterpart in Vera Pavlovna’s sewing cooperative and commune. 
Sleary’s circus and the values of imagination and recreation it repre- 
sents have become the picnics and gala balls of Chernyshevsky’'s emer- 
ging utopia. And Dickens’ solidly liberal criticism of all the major in- 
stitutions of mid-nineteenth-century England—economic, political, 
social, religious, educational, and domestic—has become, in Cherny- 
shevsky’s novel, a radical critique of mid-nineteenth-century Russia, 
with the ultimate goal of revolutionary transformation replacing that 
of gradual reform. 

While Rousseau, Sand, and Dickens proved to be the three most 
important Western authors whose novels influenced Chernyshevsky’s 
What Is to Be Done?, within the Russian literary tradition it was Her- 
zen's Who Is to Blame? (1841-1846) and Turgenev's Fathers and Sons 
(1862) that exerted the greatest impact.*! Like Chernyshevsky subse- 
quently, Herzen began where Sand’s Jacques left off. In his novel he 
too created a romantic triangle that develops into a short-lived mé- 
nage a trois until the conflict is resolved.4? In Herzen’s novel, however, 
it is the rival, not the husband, who departs and resigns himself to a 
life of aimless wandering. Yet Beltov’s decision brings no relief to the 
principal players: Lyubov’s health declines while her husband sinks 
deeper into drink. The tragic unhappiness resulting for all those in- 
volved offered little hope for either the emancipation of women or the 
personal fulfillment of critical intellectuals in mid-nineteenth-century 
Russia. 

Herzen’s novel thus represents more than a love story. Who Is to 
Blame? is a novel of ideas and issues given artistic form through vivid 
characterization. In particular, Herzen was concerned with the same 
basic questions that agitated Chernyshevsky: defining the social role of 
intellectuals and determining their ability to affect Russia’s future. Yet 
Herzen offered more pessimistic answers than his successor. His chief 
male character, the aristocratic Vladimir Beltov, is an “ideological 
hero,” a man of noble soul but weak character, who fails to find a way 
to translate his lofty ideals into effective action and thereby relieve 
Russia’s oppressiveness. The reader is left to wonder whether the fault

lies with the man, the constraints of his environment, or the rigidity of 
his ideals. Beltov's tragedy thus is not merely personal-psychological 
but also sociopolitical, and Herzen managed to combine these two 
levels in a compelling work of fiction. But the question posed by Her- 
zen’s title—the responsibility for his characters’ ineffectuality and for 
Russia's oppressiveness—remained unanswered because the author 
had no answer. Chernyshevsky, ascribing blame to both the patriar- 
chal tsarist system and Beltov’s misplaced idealism, would pose a 
different, more practical question in the title of his novel. In doing so, 
he too would present both a romantic triangle and ideological heroles) 
in his book. 

Between Herzen’s Who Is to Blame? and Chernyshevsky's What Is to 
Be Done? stands (both chronologically and ideologically) Turgenev's 
controversial novel Fathers and Sons. In it the author treats as his 
central problem the relationship between ideology and romantic love, 
or, more generally, between reason and emotion. The young hero, the 
raznochinets*3 Bazarov, an ideological “nihilist’ who exalts reason 
and denies the significance of emotion or poetry, encounters love and 
passion in the form of Odintsova (and to a lesser extent Fenechka), and 
consequently discovers the “abyss of romanticism” within himself. 
The discovery undermines both his ideology and his sense of self. 
Forced to confront his own mortality, he “quits the scene” by what can 
be interpreted as a senseless, self-destructive act. Reason without ide- 
alism, Turgenev seems to say, can provide neither a guide to action for 
the intelligentsia nor a solution to Russia's ills. 

While Turgenev’s hero articulates a much more explicit ideology 
than Herzen's Beltov, Bazarov's nihilism still remains destructive at 
best. He aims only “to clear the ground” and has absolutely no positive 
program in mind. One can also argue that the objects of Bazarov's 
romantic love are themselves unworthy of him: on the one hand, a 
spoiled and cautious aristocrat; on the other, a sweet and innocent 
peasant maiden. In terms of neither his ideology nor his love could 
Bazarov be perceived as a flattering portrait of the “new man.” In 
contrast, the hero’s weak-willed liberal friend, the nobleman Arkady 
Kirsanov, manages to achieve a measure of happiness as well as mod- 
est economic progress by combining his reason with idealism and an 
acceptance of such traditional values as love of family, nature, and the 
land. 

Chernyshevsky considered Fathers and Sons to be a dastardly cari-

Russia to indicate someone, usually an intellectual or professional, who was not of noble 
birth and who had left his or her original social estate without having been ascribed a

Introduction 27 


cature of his close friend and fellow radical critic Nikolai Dobrolyu- 
bov.44 In his own novel he sought to refute Turgenev’s portrayal of the 
“new men” (and women) and to present a more “accurate” image that 
would demonstrate the possibility of reconciling “rational egoism” 
and romantic love in a single ideology that allowed for effective action. 
Chernyshevsky consequently borrowed names from Turgenev’s work 
(Kirsanov and Lopukhov),*5 selected his heroes from the same class 
(the raznochintsy), and gave them the same noble academic calling 
(medicine). But he transformed Bazarov’s negative, ill-conceived, and 
easily abandoned nihilism into “rational egoism,” Bazarov's “abyss of 
romanticism” into mature, “rational” love, and his self-destructive urge 
into a revolutionary movement. Even Turgenev's caricature of a “liber- 
ated woman” (Kukshina) was replaced by the genuinely emancipated 
Vera Pavlovna. Chernyshevsky’s novel must thus be seen as part of an 
ongoing debate in Russian literature, with each author developing, 
refuting, recasting, and transforming the characters, plot, and themes 
of his predecessors’ work. 


The Structure of What Is to Be Done? 


The first Soviet commissar of education, A. V. Lunacharsky, once 
suggested that the key to the structure of What Is to Be Done? lies in its 
“vulgar people, new people, superior people, and dreams.’*¢ This re- 
mark suggests a hierarchy of characterization; in fact, there are two, 
one for heroes and the other for heroines, with opportunity for com- 
parison and contrasts both within and between the two groups. 

Among males, the three most important “vulgar” characters (all from 
the nobility) are Misha Storeshnikov, dominated by a desire for Vera 
Pavlovna’s respectability; Jean Solovtsov, passionately in love with Kat- 
ya Polozova’s wealth; and Serge, absolutely devoted to Julie Letellier’s 
will. The first two, both ultimately unsuccessful suitors, demonstrate 
no possibility whatever of improvement, thereby apparently contra- 
dicting Chernyshevsky’s own theory of environmental determinism. 
Serge appears minimally acceptable and, with Julie’s prompting, even 
manages to act nobly on a few occasions. 

The main heroes of the novel, Lopukhov and Kirsanov, occupy the

gentry estates in Turgenev’s Fathers and Sons.

next level up. Both of these “new men” emerge from the midst of the 
raznochintsy, both pursue medical studies, and both are strong pro- 
ponents as well as exponents of Chernyshevsky’s central tenet of “ra- 
tional egoism.” 

On the highest level in the masculine hierarchy stands Rakhmetov, 
the “superior person,” an “extraordinary man.” A descendant of an old 
Russian family of wealthy aristocrats, he manages to overcome this 
handicap to become a revolutionary ascetic, a prodigy of self-disci- 
pline, a virtuous and incorruptible militant, devoted to the cause of 
revolution. His life story has been shown to bear a close resemblance 
to the Russian hagiographic tradition, particularly to the Life of Al- 
eksei, Man of God,47 while both his teachings and his deeds reveal a 
multitude of religious (specifically Christian) themes and motifs.48 
Chernyshevsky's one attempt to humanize his superhero—he gives 
him a penchant for fine cigars—does little to bring Rakhmetov down 
to earth. He remains an artificial creation, a model for emulation, 
placed in the novel both to humiliate mere mortals and to inspire 
them to become at least “new men,” if not “superior” ones. 

A similar hierarchy of characters exists on the female side. On the 
lowest level stands Marya Aleksevna, Vera’s greedy and deceitful moth- 
er; Julie Letellier, the French courtesan; Nastya Kryukova, the “fallen 
woman”; and Katya Polozova, the mistaken woman. But Chernyshev- 
sky displays much greater generosity toward these “vulgar” women 
than he does toward his men. Actually eulogized before being 
dismissed, Marya Aleksevna is explained as the product of her en- 
vironment. Circumstances also account for the behavior of Julie, who 
sympathizes with Vera's plight and assists her on several occasions. 
Rescued from her life of prostitution by Kirsanov, Nastya becomes a 
productive member of the sewing cooperative. Kirsanov also rescues 
Katya from the error of her ways; she becomes a virtuous character 
and falls in love with Lopukhov-Beaumont. Thus although apparently 
more capable of redemption than men, women still have to depend on 
their male counterparts for liberation. 

Vera Pavlovna, of course, represents the outstanding model of the 
“new woman.” From Rousseau’s Julie and George Sand’s heroines she 
has inherited a belief in the centrality of love. But like her Russian 
predecessors, in particular Herzen’s Lyubov, she is a full participant in 
the debate over the “woman question” in Russian letters. In one sense 
the entire novel can be said to describe the development of Vera Pav- 
lovna’s consciousness both as a human being and as a woman. Here

Introduction 29 


Chernyshevsky'’s humanizing touches, including the heroine's fond- 
ness for fine boots in her wardrobe and fresh cream in her tea, prove 
more successful in tempering the idealized aspects of her character. 

But Chernyshevsky’s heroine has a long way to go before she be- 
comes an emancipated woman. The process requires self-reflection, 
study, and engagement in cooperative labor. Three times during the 
course of the action Vera Pavlovna too must be aided by men who 
appear just in the nick of time. Lopukhov rescues her from the oppres- 
sive environment of her family; Kirsanov frees her from a loveless 
marriage and from her ultimately unfulfilling work in the sewing coop- 
erative; and finally, Rakhmetov releases her from her guilt and her 
intellectual error by explaining the true meaning of all her thoughts, 
feelings, and desires. Thus although Vera Pavlovna represents a signifi- 
cant advance over Herzen’s pathetic Lyubov and Turgenev's isolated 
Odintsova and ridiculous Kukshina, she still must be seen as a “new 
woman” in the making. But then again, she also must be perceived as 
representing attainable qualities. 

At the highest level in Chernyshevsky’s female hierarchy stands the 
mysterious spirit who appears to Vera Pavlovna in each of her four 
dreams. This goddess identifies herself as “Love for Humanity,” but is 
also called by the tautological sobriquets “Bride of Her Bridegrooms” 
and “Sister of Her Sisters.” She represents dispassionate wisdom, om- 
niscience, and virtue, and leads Vera Pavlovna through a process of 
self-discovery and self-realization toward ultimate emancipation. 
When Vera asks in her fourth dream for a glimpse of the goddess’s 
face, there occurs what has been called a “reverse transfiguration”4? as 
the spirit reveals that she possesses none other than Vera Pavlovna’s 
own face and form, since Chernyshevsky’s heroine represents the 
highest form of female virtue attainable at that time. Like Rakhmetov, 
the mysterious goddess appears as a model for emulation, to humili- 
ate and inspire mortals to reach and attain at least the earth, if not yet 
the stars. 

The literary technique employed by Chernyshevsky in expressing 
his ideas through these hierarchies of characters has aroused con- 
siderable controversy. F. B. Randall acknowledges that the novel is not 
modern in any formal sense and that it does not depend in any way on 
the beauty of its language. But he cites its elaborate plot, serious con- 
versation, detailed characterization, and Victorian sense of humor as 
well as the author’s didacticism as hallmarks of Chernyshevsky’s nov- 
elistic technique.°°

30 What Is to Be Done? 


William Woehrlin and N. G. O. Pereira, both historians, come closer 
to articulating the popular view of Chernyshevsky as a writer. Woehr- 
lin repeatedly uses such terms as “artistic failing,” “incapacity as a 
writer,” and “literary failure” to describe the author and his work.5! 
Pereira declares that by any artistic standards What Is to Be Done? is 
“simply a bad novel” and that its author's forte was clearly “not literary 
talent.”52 

Two recent works in English have shed new light on Chernyshev- 
sky’s technique and should occasion a major reconsideration of his 
reputation as a writer. In a book devoted primarily to a study of Dos- 
toevsky’s Diary of a Writer, Gary Saul Morson includes some extremely 
insightful remarks about Chernyshevsky’s What Is to Be Done?®3 He 
analyzes it as a literary utopia that makes extensive and effective use of 
metaliterary techniques to implicate its readers. He draws attention to 
the author's strategy of alternating narrative and metanarrative: the 
interruptions, inquisitions, essays, and so on all form part of what 
Morson describes as Chernyshevsky's “didactic framebreaking.” Thus, 
for a contemporary audience, reading the novel became a form of 
complicity with the author as he engaged in a political act designed to 
implicate his readers. The author's Aesopian language should thus be 
viewed not merely as a literary technique employed to evade tsarist 
censorship but as one of the work's principal themes. 

In the first comprehensive study of Chernyshevsky’s novel, Irina 
Paperno argues that the basic structural principle of the novel consists 
in the organization of the narrative world in terms of the opposition of 
contrasting qualities, concepts, and characters. She identifies a mech- 
anism for the resolution of these oppositions through which, after a 
series of formal operations, a quality is identified with its opposite. She 
studies this “reconciliation of oppositions” in all its variations and at 
every level of structure in the novel. 

In addition Paperno interprets What Is to Be Done? as a “new Gos- 
pel.” Moving beyond Chernyshevsky’s obvious allusions to the Bible 
and the Christian tradition, she explores the implications of title, sub- 
title, structural patterns, and motifs (wedding, death and resurrection, 
sainthood, martyrdom). She concludes that the novel represents noth- 
ing less than the “New Testament of the late nineteenth century—a 
true positivistic Gospel,” one that fulfilled its role in Russian letters not 
in spite of its artistic faults but rather because of them. Paperno pro-

vides a convincing argument both for the tremendous emotional ap- 
peal that the novel had for Russian readers of the 1860s and for its 
impact on Russian society and politics. 


Responses to What Is to Be Done? 


The response to What Is to Be Done? was immediate and passionate. 
Radical young intelligenty found in the novel an appealing solution to 
what they considered to be the problems plaguing mid-nineteenth 
century Russia as well as to their own sense of alienation, uncertainty, 
and helplessness. On the one hand, the novel offered the vision of a 
future in which Russia was prosperous, socially just, and on a par with 
Europe as a member of a new world community. Indeed, through the 
application of science and technology to the peasant commune, Rus- 
sia could move from last to first in the march of human progress. On 
the other hand, What Is to Be Done? exalted the current status of the 
intelligentsia by stressing its members’ nobility of character and their 
central role in the process of social and economic development. 
Through knowledge and their own rational actions, they too could 
fulfill Christ’s prophecy that the last shall be first.54 It might be added 
that this social inversion also overcame Chernyshevsky’s personal in- 
adequacies and problems. In the novel, the socially graceless and shy 
Chernyshevsky is transformed into the accomplished Lopukhov, 
skilled in conversation, dancing, business, and cards; as Vera Pavlovna, 
the frivolous and materialistic Olga Sokratovna comes to share her 
husband's ideals and concerns. But while “new Russia” had been 
transfigured by industrial technology, the elimination of all patriarchal 
relations, and sexual as well as intellectual freedom, it remained pri- 
marily a rural society where the individual found meaning and self- 
fulfillment through his or her contribution to an agrarian community. 
Chernyshevsky’s utopia thus retained a comforting anchor in the this- 
worldly present while projecting a transcendental other-worldly vi- 
sion of the future.55 The combination proved inspirational. 

By convincing educated young Russians of the need for radical ac- 
tion, What Is to Be Done? widened the rift between reformers and 
revolutionaries within the intelligentsia beyond repair. Denouncing 
the Alexandrine reforms as inadequate, radical intellectuals, disaffect- 
ed women, and idealistic youths immediately accepted the novel as a

creed of personal morality and a program for social action. The failure 
of their efforts to liberate themselves and transform society through 
scientific study, defiance of social conventions, and the organization of 
cooperative enterprises frequently owed as much to their imprac- 
ticality as to tsarist suppression, but the suppression was real enough 
to convince many of them that Chernyshevsky was right to reject 
liberal methods. Propelled toward more violent means, they and later 
Russian revolutionaries were still inspired by the author's idealized 
image of dedicated and self-sacrificing intellectuals, capable of trans- 
forming society through knowledge and action.5® 

This spiritual message inspired not only the populist youths and 
terrorists who willingly endured personal hardship and risked im- 
prisonment or execution to proselytize among the people or to kill 
tsarist officials, and even Alexander II himself in 1881, in the people's 
name. It also stirred Russian Marxists, who otherwise rejected Cher- 
nyshevsky’s ideas as idealistic and therefore unrealistic. Declared 
Georgi Plekhanov, an erstwhile populist considered to be the father of 
Russian Marxism: 


Who has not read and reread this famous work? Who has not been 
charmed by it, who has not become cleaner, better, braver, and bolder 
under its philanthropic influence? Who has not imitated the purity of the 
principal characters? Who, after reading this novel, has not reflected on 
his personal life, has not subjected his personal striving and tendencies 
to a severe examination? We all draw from it moral strength and faith in a 
better future.57 


And defending What Is to Be Done? against a critic in a Swiss café, 
Lenin called Chernyshevsky 


the greatest and most talented representative of socialism before Marx. 

. .. Under his influence hundreds of people became revolutionaries. . . . 
He plowed me up more profoundly than anyone else. . . . After my broth- 
er’s execution, knowing that Chernyshevsky's novel was one of his favor- 
ite books, I really undertook to read it, and I sat over it not for several days 
but for several weeks. Only then did I understand its depth. ... It's a 
thing that supplies energy for a whole lifetime.5*

Introduction 33 


Indeed, paying tribute to Chernyshevsky’s influence on him, Lenin 
named his own seminal pamphlet of 1902 on the role and organization 
of the revolutionary party What Is to Be Done? The novel’s enduring 
legacy, then, lay in the provision of an idealized model for emulation 
and a moral creed for Russian social revolutionaries. It was a strange 
legacy for a professed materialist to leave behind, but not one that 
Chernyshevsky would have disavowed. 

Moderates, in contrast, resented the novel’s harsh criticism of their 
beliefs and moral character, while conservatives were incensed by its 
condemnation of traditional values and institutions. Both denounced 
it as the progeny as well as the generator of moral decay, spiritual 
degeneration, and social collapse. For conservatives, however, Cher- 
nyshevsky’s radicalism was simply the inevitable outcome of liberal 
reformism. Thus the novel helped to harden the attitude of conserva- 
tives against further reform of Russian social and political institutions. 

The literary response to What Is to Be Done? proved equally strong. 
The novel spawned a special genre of antinihilist literature, including 
such works as Tolstoy's play The Infected Family (1863-1864), Aleksei 
Pisemsky's Troubled Sea (1863), and Nikolai Leskov’s No Way Out (1864), 
and culminated in the greatest anti-nihilist novel of the nineteenth 
century, Dostoevsky’s Possessed (1872).5° In addition, the figure of 
Chernyshevsky appeared unflatteringly as a fictional character in a 
number of works, ranging from Dmitry Grigorovich’s School of Hospi- 
tality (1865) to Vladimir Nabokov's novel The Gift (1937).6° 

But by far the most fascinating literary response provoked by What 
Is to Be Done? appeared shortly after the novel was published—Dos- 
toevsky's brilliant Notes from Underground (1865). A discussion of the 
complicated relationship between these two works can be found in 
Joseph Frank’s cultural biography of Dostoevsky.®! There Frank com- 
bines the insight of two Soviet critics, V. L. Komarovich, who demon- 
strated that Dostoevsky’s work was structurally dependent on Cher- 
nyshevsky’s novel, and A. P. Skaftymov, who explored the role of the 
underground man as his creator’s spokesman. Frank argues that the 
underground man is really a parodistic persona whose life exemplifies 
the tragicomic impasses resulting from his acceptance of all the im- 
plications of reason in its then-current Russian incarnation, especially 
those that Chernyshevsky chose to disregard.

Soviet and Western Criticism of What is to be Done? 


By and large, Soviet criticism of Chernyshevsky’s What Is to Be Done? 
has been ideological and reductionist. Typical is the statement made 
by Piotr Nikolayev in the introduction to the recent Soviet translation 
of the novel into English: 


Characteristic of Russian prose in general, and What Is to Be Done? in 
particular, is its noble social sentiment aspiring to conscious service in 
the people's name towards a better life on this earth. It is a rare example 
of a work of fiction consummating the social and economic thought of its 
country and its time. In the fullest sense, it became a weapon in the 
hands of its author, a revolutionary scholar and man of letters. For it was 
conceived in the thick and consecrated to the cause of battle.®? 


There are a few exceptions. Grigory Tamarchenko’s monograph Cher- 
nyshevsky-romanist (Chernyshevsky the novelist) and his introduction 
to the authoritative edition in the Literary Monument Series represent 
valuable contributions to our understanding of the work, as does S. A. 
Reiser’s article in the same volume.® Otherwise, one falls back on the 
earlier studies by M. P. Alekseev and A. P. Skaftymov, which explore 
Chernyshevsky’s relations to Western European literature; T. A. Bog- 
danovich’s monograph on the private lives of men of the 1860s; and a 
few articles by Yu. K. Rudenko, including one on characterization.®4 
Two volumes of Soviet commentary on the novel, one by N. L. Brodsky 
and N. P. Sidorov (1933), the other by M. T. Pinaev (1963), also contain a 
few valuable insights.® 

Western criticism has served Chernyshevsky somewhat better, but it 
was not until Irina Paperno’s penetrating study of the author's life and 
work that a really first-rate monograph has been available. Books by 
Randall (1967), Woehrlin (1971), and Pereira (1975) have been referred to 
earlier. The first emphasizes Chernyshevsky as a writer and argues 
that he constitutes a major figure in Russian letters whose novel de- 
serves to be read as literature. Woehrlin concentrates on the role of 
What Is to Be Done? in public debate and its impact on Russian youth.

Introduction 35 


Pereira describes Chernyshevsky neither as the thoroughgoing revolu- 
tionary that his Soviet admirers assert him to be nor as the gravedigger 
of liberal humanism his anti-Soviet detractors portray, but rather as 
the first full-fledged theorist of democratic socialism in Russia. 


English Translations of What is to be Done? 


While Western criticism may have served Chernyshevsky somewhat 
better than its Soviet counterpart, Western translators have done the 
novel a distinct disservice.66 Until now only two American translations 
of the novel have appeared, both in 1886, both woefully inadequate. 
They are flawed by numerous inaccuracies and infelicities, and their 
English is now antiquated. The first was published by Benjamin R. 
Tucker, a famous American anarchist who knew no Russian and prob- 
ably based his translation on a French version. Tucker's version was 
“revised and abridged” (i.e., censored and truncated) by Ludmilla Tur- 
kevich and published by the Vintage Russian Library in 1961. When 
this volume went out of print it was reissued by Virago Books in 1983 
in a so-called expanded form by Cathy Porter with only a small portion 
of the omitted material reinstated. 

The second American translation was published by Nathan Haskell 
Dole, an American man of letters, and S. S. Skidelsky. Although Dole 
knew Russian, his translation also suffers from numerous blunders, 
literalisms, awkward phrases, and infelicitous expressions. After hav- 
ing been out of print for many years, his version was recently reissued 
by Ardis Publishers in a facsimile edition with a new introduction by 
Kathryn Feuer. Although Feuer claims that her volume provides a 
complete translation of Chernyshevsky’s novel, in fact the reprint con- 
tains all the omissions of Dole’s Victorian version, including a number 
of erotic passages. 

In addition to these American translations, a Soviet edition of What 
Is to Be Done? translated by Laura Beraha was published by Raduga in 
1983. Though it is at least complete, one scholar has characterized it 
accurately as “mutilated by the translator’s determined use of out- 
dated and confused British (especially Cockney) and U.S. (Western 
cowboy) slang.”®? 

The publication of this new translation is intended to make the 
complete text of Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done? readily available 
to English and American readers for the first time. The text is accom-

panied by a comprehensive commentary designed to make the novel 
comprehensible to the general reader. A list of principal characters 
(including accent marks for pronunciation) precedes the text, and a 
selected bibliography of works in English follows it. It is our hope that 
the availability of a complete, accurate, and readable version will allow 
English and American readers to fathom the impact of Chernyshev- 
sky's novel on human lives as well as the source of its power to make 
history. 

Readers will find a rich work of synthesis that creatively fashioned 
many of the salient ideas then current in Western Europe into a coher- 
ent ideology that addressed universal themes as well as the historical 
problems and conditions of mid-nineteenth century Russia. For in 
seeking solutions to Russia’s ills, Chernyshevsky explored the nature 
of marriage and the family, human intimacy, and the need for sexual 
freedom. In evaluating the tsarist social order, he examined the basis 
of relations between social groups, the role of women, the sources of 
prostitution, and the relationship between social structure and politi- 
cal power. Turning to economics, he discussed the sources and mean- 
ing of backwardness, the process and social costs of development, and 
alternative forms of organizing production. As a religious thinker, he 
committed sacrilege by having his characters violate Christian sacra- 
ments, rituals, and beliefs and by establishing his own religion of 
atheism, complete with its own appropriation of those same religious 
patterns, symbols, images, and motifs.68 In the realm of psychology 
Chernyshevsky explored human emotions and motivations, particu- 
larly the tension between egoism and altruism and between reason 
and irrationality. To be sure, his ideas on these issues often seem 
simplistic and naive, especially to late-twentieth-century eyes gazing 
back over the destruction as well as accomplishments that human 
reason, science, and technology have wrought.®? Like the intelligentsia 
generally, Chernyshevsky overestimated the power of ideas and hu- 
man reason to solve complex social problems. His belief in human 
intellect and in a universal human nature led him to prescribe solu- 
tions to problems, whether of peasants or of women, that often re- 
flected his values and needs more than those of the intended benefici- 
aries. But in exploring so many aspects of human life, Chernyshevsky’s 
novel still challenges its readers to think about them. That, too, is a 
legacy the moralistic teacher from Saratov would probably not have 
disavowed.

i. The Fool 


On the morning of July 11, 1856, the staff of one of the large hotels 
near the Moscow Railway Station in Petersburg was in a quandary, 
almost in a state of distress. On the previous evening at nine o'clock, a 
gentleman had arrived carrying a suitcase. He had taken a room, sub- 
mitted his passport for registration, and ordered tea and a cutlet. He 
said that he wished not to be disturbed because he was very tired and 
wanted to get some sleep, but had asked to be awakened at eight 
o'clock the next morning because he had urgent business. He had 
locked his door; after a brief rattle of cutlery and crockery, all had 
become silent—apparently he had fallen asleep. At eight o'clock the 
next morning a servant knocked at the guest's door, but there was no 
answer. The servant knocked more loudly, very loudly indeed, but still 
there was no reply. Apparently the guest was sound asleep. The ser- 
vant waited a quarter of an hour, tried to wake him again, but was no 
more successful. Then he conferred with the other servants and with 
the waiter. “Perhaps something has happened to him?” “We must 
break the door down.” “No, that'll never do: a door can be broken 
down only in the presence of the police.” So they would attempt to 
awaken him once more, knocking even more loudly; if that didn’t

Christ, these “new people” will be instrumental in transforming both individuals and 
society and thereby will establish paradise on earth.

work, they would send for the police. They made one last try, but 
failed to awaken him. They sent for the police; now everyone was 
waiting to see what would happen. A police officer arrived around ten 
o'clock. First he tried knocking; then he ordered the servants to knock. 
The result was exactly the same. “Well, lads, we have no choice but to 
break down the door.” 

They broke down the door. The room was empty. “Look under the 
bed.” The guest wasn’t there, either. The police officer went over to the 
table, on which lay a sheet of paper inscribed with large letters: “I shall 
leave here at eleven p.m. and shall not return. You will hear me on the 
Liteiny [Foundry] Bridge* between two and three o'clock in the morn- 
ing. There is no need to suspect anyone else.” 

“So that’s it! Now it’s all clear. No one could make head or tail of it,” 
said the police officer. 

“What is it, Ivan Afanasievich?” asked the waiter. 

“Bring me some tea and I'll tell you all about it.” 

For a long time afterward the policeman’s story served as the sub- 
ject of animated retelling and discussion in the hotel. The story goes 
as follows: 

About 2:30 a.m., on a dark, cloudy night, there was a sudden flash of 
light and the sound of a shot from the middle of the Liteiny Bridge. 
The night watchmen ran toward the noise and a few passers-by gath- 
ered around. But no one was there and there was nothing left on the 
spot from which the sound had come. It appeared that someone had 
shot himself, rather than shot at someone else. A few men volunteered 
to dive; after a while some boathooks were produced and then even a 
fisherman’s net. They dived, searched, fished around, caught some 
fifty large spars, but failed to retrieve even one body. How could they? 
It was so dark! During those two intervening hours the body must have 
been washed out to sea. Go and search along the shore. There 
emerged, as a result, a group of “progressives” who rejected the pre- 
vious proposition: “Perhaps there never was a body. Maybe it was 
some drunk or mischiefmaker fooling around—someone who fired a 
shot and then ran off. Or else, I wonder, could he be standing here 
right now among this bustling crowd, chuckling about the fuss he’s 
caused.” 

But the majority, as always when they are behaving sensibly, turned 
out to be “conservative” and defended their position: “What nonsense! 
Fooling around! No, someone put a bullet through his head and that’s 
all there is to it!” The progressives were defeated. But, as usual, the 
victorious party split immediately after its victory. All right. So he blew

Neva River. 


What Is to Be Done? 41 


his brains out. But why did he do it? Some of the conservatives were of 
the opinion that he was “dead drunk”; others argued that perhaps he 
had “gone broke.” Someone else observed that he was simply a fool. 
On this view, “simply a fool,” everyone was in agreement, even those 
who denied that he had shot himself. Indeed, whether it was someone 
drunk or broke who had shot himself, or some mischiefmaker who 
hadn't shot himself but was only playing a trick, it was still a stupid, 
foolish thing to do. 

Thus the affair on the bridge that night came to an end. The next 
morning in the hotel at the Moscow Railway Station it was discovered 
that the fool had not been fooling around at all, but really had shot 
himself. But in the resolution of this affair there remained one element 
with which even the defeated party could agree: namely, that even if 
someone had not been making mischief but really had shot himself, he 
was still a fool. This result, satisfactory for all concerned, was particu- 
larly sound precisely because of the triumph it afforded the conserva- 
tives. Indeed, if someone had merely played a prank with that shot on 
the bridge, then, in fact, it would still be open to question whether the 
person was a fool or merely a mischiefmaker. But someone who shot 
himself on the bridge! Who would shoot himself on a bridge? How 
could it happen? For what purpose? How stupid to do it on a bridge! 
Therefore, this someone was undoubtedly a fool. 

Once again doubts began to occur: someone had shot himself on a 
bridge. But people don’t shoot themselves on bridges; therefore, he 
didn’t shoot himself. But toward evening the staff of the hotel was 
summoned to the police station to identify a peaked cap that had a 
bullet hole in it and had been fished out of the water. Everyone con- 
firmed that the cap was the very one the guest had been wearing. Thus 
he had undoubtedly shot himself; the spirit of protest and progress 
was decisively defeated. 

Everyone was in agreement that he was a “fool.” But suddenly they 
all declared: “How shrewd to do it on a bridge! If his aim was poor, it 
would obviously end his suffering at once. Good thinking! If he had 
been wounded, he would have fallen into the water and drowned 
before he could regain consciousness. Yes indeed, on a bridge . . . very 
clever!” 

One couldn't make any sense whatever of this whole affair: he was 
both a fool and very clever. 


ii. The First Consequence of This Foolish Affair 


On the same morning, a little after eleven o'clock, a young lady was 
sitting in one of three rooms in a small cottage on Kamenny [Stone] 


42 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Island.4 She was sewing and, in a low voice, singing a bold and daring 
French song.> 

“We are poor,” went the words of the song, “but we are working 
people; we have strong hands. We are uneducated, but not stupid, and 
we long for light. We shall study—knowledge will set us free. We shall 
work—labor will enrich us. This will come to pass. If we live a little 
longer, we shall live to see it”: 


Ca ira, 
Qui vivra, verra. 


(This will come to pass, 
He who lives, will see it.) 


“We are coarse, but it is we ourselves who suffer from this coarse- 
ness. We are full of prejudices, but it is we ourselves who suffer as a 
result—we understand this. We shall search for happiness, we shall 
discover humaneness, and we shall become good. This will come to 
pass. If we live a little longer, we shall live to see it. 

“Labor without knowledge bears no fruit. Our own happiness is 
impossible without the happiness of others. We shall become edu- 
cated, we shall be enriched; we will be happy and will become broth- 
ers and sisters. This will come to pass. If we live a little longer, we shall 
live to see it. 

“Let us study and work; let us sing and love; there will be heaven on 
earth. Let us rejoice in life. This will come to pass, it will come to pass 
soon, we shall all live to see it”: 


Donc, vivons, 

Ca bien vite ira, 

Ca viendra, 

Nous tous le verrons. 


(So let us live, 

It will soon come to pass, 
It will come to pass, 

We shall all see it.] 


4. An island in the Neva estuary which became a popular site for summer cottages 
(dachas), particularly of the St. Petersburg social elite. 

5. An allusion to the revolutionary song La Marseillaise, later the French national 
anthem. Chernyshevsky altered the original French lyrics and replaced them with his 
own in order to express his revolutionary enthusiasm, faith in knowledge, and idealiza- 
tion of labor. Throughout the novel Chernyshevsky uses the device of deliberate mis- 
translation to illustrate his theory of social inversion and transformation. 


What Is to Be Done? 43 


The song was bold and daring and its tune was cheerful. It con- 
tained two or three somber notes, but they were submerged in the 
overall joyfulness of its melody; they disappeared in the refrain and 
vanished in the concluding couplet—at least, they were supposed to 
be submerged, to disappear, and they would have if the lady had been 
in a different mood. But right now these few somber notes are more 
audible than all the others. Having noticed this, she seems to rouse 
herself. She lowers her voice on these somber notes and begins to sing 
the more cheerful ones that followed with greater spirit. But once 
again her thoughts wander from the song to her own preoccupations 
and the somber notes gain the upper hand. Obviously the young lady 
does not want to give herself up to sadness; however, it appears that 
sadness will not leave her alone, try as she may to cast it off. But 
whether the cheerful song is sad or whether it becomes cheerful once 
again as it is supposed to, the lady continues sewing very diligently. 
She is a good seamstress. 

A young maid enters the room. 

“Masha, look at how well I can sew! I've almost finished the sleeves 
on this dress I'm planning to wear to your wedding.” 

“Yes, but it’s much plainer than the one you embroidered for me!” 

“I should hope so! Surely the bride must be the most elegantly 
dressed woman at her own wedding!” 

“I have brought a letter for you, Vera Pavlovna.”€ 

A look of perplexity passed across Vera Pavlovna’s face as she began 
to open it. The envelope bore a Petersburg postmark. “How can that 
be? Why, he’s in Moscow!” She hastily unfolded the letter and sud- 
denly grew pale; the hand holding the letter dropped to her side. “No, 
it isn’t so! I didn’t manage to read it all. It couldn't have said that!” And 
again she raised her hand with the letter. All of this occurred within a 
few seconds. But the second time her gaze remained fixed for several 
moments on the few lines of the letter. Her bright eyes grew dimmer 
and dimmer and the letter dropped from her limp hand onto the 
sewing table. She covered her face with her hands and began to sob. 
“Oh, what have I done? What have I done?” And she sobbed once 
again. 

“Verochka, what’s the matter? Since when have you become a cry- 
baby? What on earth is the matter?” 

A young man entered the room with quick but light, careful steps. 

“Read the letter,” she said. “It’s on the table.” 


6. The name Vera Pavlovna suggests both faith (vera) and the Apostle Paul. In the 
Orthodox tradition, Vera was also the name of an early Christian martyr and therefore 
came to represent a maiden dedicated to Christ. 


44 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


She was no longer sobbing; she sat completely still, scarcely breath- 
ing. 

The young man took the letter. He also turned pale and his hands 
began to tremble. He looked at the letter for a very long time, even 
though it was only thirty words or so in all: “I was disturbing your 
peace and quiet. I am quitting the scene. Don't pity me; I love you both 
so much that I am very pleased with this decisive act. Farewell.” 

The young man stood rubbing his forehead for quite some time; 
then he began to twirl his mustache and stare at the sleeve of his 
overcoat. Finally he collected his thoughts. He took a step toward the 
young woman; she was still sitting motionless as before, scarcely 
breathing, as if in a stupor. He took her hand. 

“Verochka!” 

But as soon as his hand touched hers, she jumped up with a terrible 
scream, as if hit by an electric shock. She swiftly stepped back from the 
young man and impetuously pushed him away. 

“Get away! Don’t touch me! You have blood on your hands! His 
blood! I can’t bear to look at you! I shall leave you! At once! Get away 
from me!” She kept pushing and shoving the empty air; suddenly she 
staggered, fell into a chair, and covered her face with her hands. 

“His blood is on me! On me, as well. You're not the guilty one. I am. I 
alone! What have I done? Oh, what have I done?” 

She sobbed and gasped for breath. 

“Verochka,” he said softly and timidly, “my friend!” 

She took a deep breath, and in a calm but still quivering voice she 
spoke as best she could: “My dear, leave me now! Come back in an 
hour and I'll have calmed down. Get me some water and then leave 
me.” 

He obeyed her in silence. He went to his own room, sat down again 
at the desk where only a quarter of an hour ago he had been sitting so 
serenely and contentedly, and took up his pen... . “One must know 
how to control oneself at times like these; I have the willpower. All this 
will pass . . . it will pass.” And unbeknownst to him his pen was writ- 
ing in the middle of some article: “Will she be able to bear it? How 
awful—our happiness has been ruined... .” 

“My dearest! I'm ready now. Let’s talk!” came a call from the other 
room. The young woman’s voice sounded hollow but steady. 

“My dear, we must part. I have made the decision. I know it will be 
difficult, but it would be even more difficult for us to go on seeing each 
other. I am his murderer. I have killed him for your sake.” 

“Verochka, how are you to blame?” 

“Don’t say anything. Don’t try to make excuses for me or I'll grow to 
hate you. It is I ...1 am to blame for everything. Forgive me, my dear. 


What Is to Be Done? 45 


I've made a decision that's very painful for you—and, my dear, for me, 
too. But there’s nothing else I can do. In a short while you yourself will 
see that it has to be like this. There's no other choice, my friend. Listen 
to me. I am leaving Petersburg. It will be easier for me to live far away 
from places that would remind me of my past. I'll sell all my things 
and be able to live for some time on the money I get for them. Where? 
In Tver, in Nizhny Novgorod . . .1 don't know where! It doesn’t matter. 
I'll try to give singing lessons. I'll probably find some pupils because I'l] 
settle in a large town. If I don't find any, I'll become a governess. I don't 
expect to need anything, but if I do, then I'll certainly turn to you. Take 
care that you set aside a small amount of money for me just in case. 
You know that I have so many needs and expenses, even though I try 
to be frugal. I won't be able to get along without that. Do you hear? I 
am not refusing your assistance. This will prove to you, my dear, that 
you still remain precious to me. . . . And now let's bid farewell forever! 
Set off for town—at once, immediately! It'll be easier for me once I’m 
left here alone. I shall be gone by tomorrow. Then you may come back. 
I'll go to Moscow, make inquiries, and find out in which provincial 
towns I'd be most assured of finding pupils. I forbid you to see me off 
at the station. Farewell, my dear. Give my your hand for the very last 
time.” 

He wanted to embrace her, but she prevented him from doing so. 

“No, don't, I won't allow it! It would be an insult to him. Give me 
your hand. See how I clasp it! Now, farewell!” 

He did not release her hand. 

“Enough. Now go.” She freed her hand; he dared not stop her. 
“Farewell!” 

She looked at him very tenderly, but withdrew to her own room with 
a firm step, never once turning back to look at him. 

He couldn't find his hat for the longest time. Five times he must have 
held it, but he didn’t even know it. It was as though he were drunk. At 
last he realized that the hat he was looking for was in his hand. He 
stepped into the vestibule and put on his coat. He was approaching 
the gate when suddenly ... “Who's chasing me? It's probably Ma- 
sha... . Vera has undoubtedly taken ill!” He turned around. Vera Pav- 
lovna threw herself on his neck, hugging and kissing him. 

“No, my dear, I couldn't stop myself! Now, farewell forever!” 

She ran back, threw herself onto her bed, and let flow the tears she 
had been holding back for so long. 


Preface 


“The subject of this work is love, the main character is a woman; that’s 
fine, even if the work itself is not that good,” says the female reader. 

“That's true,” I reply. 

The male reader does not confine himself to such easy conclusions, 
since from birth man’s intellectual capability is greater than woman's 
and also much better developed. He says . . . (she probably thinks it, 
but sees no need tosay it, so I have no grounds to quarrel with her), the 
male reader says: “I know for a fact that the gentleman who committed 
suicide did not really commit suicide.” Seizing upon the phrase “know 
for a fact,” I reply, “You don’t know it for a fact, because you haven't 
been told it yet. Why, you know nothing at all by yourself! You don't 
even know that in the way I started this work I insulted you and 
humiliated you. You didn’t know that, did you? Well, now you do!” 

Yes, the first pages of my story reveal that I have avery poor opinion 
of my public. I employed the conventional ruse of a novelist: I began 
my tale with some striking scenes taken from the middle or the end, 
and I shrouded them with mystery. You, the public, are kind, very kind 
indeed, and therefore undiscriminating and slow-witted. You can’t be 
relied upon to know from the first few pages whether or not a book is 
worth reading. You have poor instincts that are in need of assistance. 
For help you can look to two things: either the author's reputation or 
his striking style. Since this is only my first novel, you haven't yet 
formed an opinion of my literary talents. (Why, you have so many 
gifted authors to choose from!) My name could not have attracted you. 
So I was obliged to bait my hook with striking scenes. Don’t condemn 
me for it: you deserve all the blame. It’s your own simpleminded 
naiveté that compelled me to stoop to such vulgarity. But now that 
you've fallen into my hands, I can continue the story as I see fit with- 
out further tricks. No mysteries lie ahead: you will always know the 


47 


48 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


outcome of every situation at least twenty pages in advance. And, to 
begin with, I shall even tell you the outcome of the entire novel: it will 
end happily, amidst wine and song. There will be neither striking 
scenes nor embellishments. The author is in no mood for such things, 
dear public, because he keeps thinking about the confusion in your 
head, and about the useless, unnecessary suffering of each and every 
one of us that results from the absurd muddle in your thoughts. I find 
it both pitiful and amusing to look at you. You are so impotent and 
spiteful, all because of the extraordinary quantity of nonsense stuffed 
between your two ears. 

I'm angry at you for being so nasty to people in general. Since you 
belong to those people, why are you so nasty to yourself? That's why 
I’m blaming you. You're nasty out of intellectual impotence. Therefore, 
even though I am blaming you, I'm also obliged to help you. How shall 
I begin to render you assistance? Perhaps by dealing with your 
thoughts at this very moment: “What sort of writer is this who talks to 
me in such an arrogant way?” I'll tell you what sort of writer I am. 

I possess not one bit of artistic talent. I even lack full command of 
the language. But that doesn’t mean a thing; read on, dearest public, it 
will be well worth your while. Truth is a good thing; it compensates for 
the inadequacies of any writer who serves its cause. Therefore, I shall 
inform you of the following: if I hadn’t warned you, you might well 
have thought that this tale was being told artistically and that its 
author possessed great poetic talent. But now that I've warned you 
that I have no talent whatever, you know that any merit to be found in 
my tale is due entirely to its truthfulness. 

But then again, dear readers, when I address you, it behooves me to 
spell everything out—since you're merely amateurs, and not at all 
experts at deciphering unstated meanings. When I say that I have not 
one bit of artistic talent and that my tale is a very weak piece of work, 
you should by no means conclude that I’m any worse than those 
authors whom you consider to be great, or that my novel is any poorer 
than theirs. That's not at all what I mean. I mean that my tale suffers 
from imperfections when it’s compared with the works of genuinely 
gifted writers. As far as the worth of its execution is concerned, you 
can confidently place my tale side by side with the most famous works 
of your well-known authors. Perhaps you'd not do wrong to place it 
even higher than theirs! It certainly contains more artistry—rest as- 
sured on that point. 

You may thank me. You so love to cringe before those who abuse 
you; So now you can cringe before me, too. 

Yet there is among you, dear readers, a particular group of people— 
by now a fairly sizable group—which I respect. I speak arrogantly to 


What Is to Be Done? 49 


the vast majority of readers, but to them alone, and up to this point I've 
been speaking only to them. But with the particular group I just men- 
tioned, I would have spoken humbly, even timidly. There is no need to 
offer them any explanation. I value their opinion, but I know in ad- 
vance that they're on my side. Good, strong, honest, capable people— 
you have only just begun to appear among us; already there's a fair 
number of you and it’s growing all the time. If you were my entire 
audience, there’d be no need for me to write. If you did not yet exist, it 
would be impossible for me to write. But you're not yet my entire 
audience, although some of you are numbered among my readers. 
Therefore, it’s still necessary and already possible for me to write. 


CHAPTER ONE 


Vera Pavlovna’s Life with Her Family 


Vera Pavlovna had a very ordinary upbringing. Her early life, before she 
made the acquaintance of the medical student Lopukhov, contained a 
few noteworthy events, but nothing unusual. Even then, however, her 
behavior showed itself to be somewhat exceptional. 

Vera Pavlovna grew up in a multistoried house on Gorokhovaya [Pea] 
Street, between Sadovaya [Garden] Street and the Semenovsky Bridge. 
At the present time this house is designated by an appropriate num- 
ber, but in 1852, when there were no such numbers, the house carried 
the inscription: “Residence of the Councillor of State? Ivan Zakharo- 
vich Storeshnikov.” That's what the inscription said; but Ivan Zakharo- 
vich Storeshnikov had died in 1837 and since then the house had 
belonged to his son, Mikhail Ivanovich—or so the legal documents 
indicated. But the tenants knew that Mikhail Ivanovich was only the 
former owner’s son, and that the real proprietor was his widow, Anna 
Petrovna. 

Then, as now, the house was large; it had two gates, four doorways 
onto the street, and three courtyards within. In 1852, just as now, the 
owner and her son lived in the rooms on the ground floor with their 
windows looking out on the street. Anna Petrovna remains just as 
handsome a woman now as she was then. Mikhail Ivanovich is just as 
handsome an officer now as he was then. 

I don't know who now resides in the fourth-floor apartment to the 
right atop the filthiest of the many back staircases off the first court- 
yard. But in 1852 these rooms were inhabited by the manager of the 


7. Fifth highest of the fourteen civil service ranks introduced by Peter the Great in 
1722. Attainment of a specific rank (initially the eighth, it was later raised repeatedly) 
conferred hereditary noble status on officials from other social estates.

building, Pavel Konstantinych Rozalsky, a portly, handsome man; his 
wife, Marya Aleksevna, a tall, thin, sturdy woman; their daughter, a 
young unmarried woman, none other than Vera Pavlovna; and their 
nine-year-old son, Fedya. 

Besides being the manager of the building, Pavel Konstantinovich 
worked as an assistant to the head of a government department. He 
received no income from this position, and only a modest one from 
being manager. Anyone else would have earned much more, but as 
Pavel Konstantinych himself used to say, he had his scruples. The 
landlady, however, was entirely satisfied with him. During his fourteen 
years of managing he had managed to accumulate a sum of about 
10,000 rubles. No more than 3,000 or so had come from the landlady's 
pocket; the rest he had acquired at no cost whatever to his employer. 
Pavel Konstantinych was a pawnbroker. 

Marya Aleksevna also was in possession of a tidy bit of capital— 
5,000 rubles or so, as she used to tell her fellow gossips, but in fact it 
was more than that. The origin of her capital dates back some fifteen 
years to the sale of a raccoon coat, miscellaneous scraps of clothing, 
and assorted bits of furniture that she had acquired at the death of her 
brother, an office clerk. Having realized a profit of some 150 rubles, she 
likewise put the money back into circulation by accepting pledges as 
collateral, taking far greater risks than her husband ever did. Several 
times she got caught at her own game. Once a swindler borrowed five 
rubles from her and left his passport as a pledge; it turned out to be 
stolen and Marya Aleksevna had to lay out an extra fifteen rubles to 
extricate herself from that affair. Another scoundrel once pawned a 
gold watch for twenty rubles; it turned out to have been lifted from a 
dead body and Marya Aleksevna had to hand over quite a hefty sum to 
get herself out of that mess. But if she suffered losses that her husband 
managed to avoid (since he was more discriminating in his choice of 
clients), she also realized greater profits. She even sought out special 
opportunities for making money. Once, when Vera Pavlovna was still 
very young— Marya Aleksevna never would have done it when her 
daughter was older, but there was absolutely no reason not to do it 
back then; the child would never have understood, thank you very 
much, if it hadn’t been for the cook, who explained the whole thing to 
her very clearly. And the cook would never have done so, since it 
wasn't right to talk about such things to children, but it happened that 
the cook couldn't restrain herself after one of the worst beatings she'd 
ever received at the hands of Marya Aleksevna following a little fling 
with her boyfriend. (By the way, Matryona always sported a black eye, 
not from Marya Aleksevna but from her boyfriend—which was all 
right, since a cook with a black eye comes cheaper!) Be that as it may, 


52 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


one time a strange lady came to see Marya Aleksevna; she was quite 
unlike all her other acquaintances—very beautiful, well dressed, and 
rather splendid. She arrived and stayed for a prolonged visit. For a 
week the visit went smoothly, except that some civilian, also very 
handsome, kept dropping by to call as well; he brought Verochka 
candy, gave her nice dolls, and presented her with two books, both 
with pictures. In one there were nice pictures of animals and towns; 
Marya Aleksevna took the other one away from Verochka as soon as 
the gentleman had gone, so that Verochka managed to glimpse the 
pictures only once, when he himself first showed them to her. And so 
the new acquaintance stayed for about a week, and everything was 
quiet. All that week Marya Aleksevna didn’t go near the cupboard 
(where the decanter of vodka stood), the key to which she never en- 
trusted to anyone. She didn’t beat Matryona, didn’t hit Verochka, and 
didn’t swear too loudly. Then one night Verochka was continually 
awakened by the strange lady’s terrible screams and by a great com- 
motion and bustle in the house. The next morning Marya Aleksevna 
went to her cupboard and stood next to it longer than usual, all the 
while repeating, “Thank God it came out all right, thank God!” She 
even summoned Matryona over to the cupboard and said, “Io your 
health, Matryonushka, you did a fine job.” Afterward, instead of fight- 
ing and squabbling, as she usually did following a visit to the cupboard, 
Marya Aleksevna gave Verochka a kiss and went off to bed. Another 
week passed quietly. The lady didn’t scream any more, but neither did 
she leave her room. Soon afterward she moved out of the house. Two 
days later another civilian arrived, not the same one as before; he 
brought along the police and abused Marya Aleksevna. But she con- 
ceded nothing and kept repeating, “I’ve no idea what you're talking 
about. Check the house register if you want to know who my guest 
was.8 An acquaintance of mine, Savastyanova—a merchant’s wife from 
Pskov—and that’s all!” Finally, after a good bit of swearing, the civilian 
left and never returned. Verochka witnessed the whole affair when she 
was eight years old; when she was nine, Matryona explained it all to 
her. However, there was only one such episode; others were different 
and not very frequent. 

Once, when Verochka was ten and was accompanying her mother 
to the flea market, she received an unexpected wallop across the back 
of her head at the intersection of Gorokhovaya and Sadovaya streets 
along with the explanation: “Instead of gawking at the church, you 


8. By law, the owner or manager of a residential building had to maintain a register 
(domovaya kniga) in which the names of tenants or temporary residents were recorded 
(see also n. 67 below). 


What Is to Be Done? 53 


idiot, why don’t you cross yourself? Can't you see that all good people 
cross themselves?" 

When Verochka was twelve she began to attend private school. She 
also started taking piano lessons from a drunken but very kind Ger- 
man piano teacher. He was a good teacher, and very inexpensive as a 
result of his drinking. 

When she was fourteen she did the sewing for her entire family; bear 
in mind, of course, that the family wasn’t all that large. 

When she was about to turn sixteen, her mother started shouting at 
her in the following manner: “Scrub that face of yours—you’re as dark 
as a gypsy girl! You'll never get it clean! I must have given birth to a 
scarecrow—I don’t know who you take after.” Verochka put up with a 
great deal on account of her dark complexion and had become quite 
accustomed to think of herself as homely. Previously her mother had 
dressed her in rags, but now she began to spruce her up a bit. This 
better-dressed Verochka who accompanied her mother to church 
used to think, “These clothes would better suit someone else. What- 
ever I wear, I'm still a gypsy girl, a scarecrow—whether I'm in a cotton 
frock or a silk dress. It would be nice to be pretty. Oh, how Id like to be 
pretty!” 

When Verochka turned sixteen, she ceased taking piano lessons and 
stopped attending private school; instead, she began giving lessons in 
that very same school. Soon her mother found other pupils for her as 
well. 

After six months or so Verochka’s mother stopped calling her a 
gypsy girl and a scarecrow and began to spruce her up even more. 
Meanwhile Matryona—this was already the third one after the afore- 
mentioned Matryona (the original's left eye was always blackened, 
whereas the replacement'’s left cheekbone was usually, but not always, 
bruised)—this third Matryona told Verochka that the head of her fa- 
ther’s department, an important department head who wore an order 
around his neck,? was planning to propose to her. Indeed, the petty 
clerks reported that the department head had of late become better 
disposed toward Pavel Konstantinovich. The department head, in 
turn, began to express the opinion in the presence of his relatives that 
what he needed most was a good-looking wife, even if she didn’t have 
a dowry, as well as the opinion that Pavel Konstantinych was not that 
bad a clerk. 

It’s not clear how all this would have ended, but the department

personnel in recognition of long or distinguished service. The highest of these honors 
also ennobled recipients from outside the hereditary nobility. 


54 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


head deliberated for a very long time and very judiciously . . .so that in 
the meantime another opportunity presented itself. 

The landlady's son dropped in on the manager to say that his moth- 
er wanted Pavel Konstantinych to collect samples of various wall- 
papers, as she was planning to redecorate her apartment. Such 
requests had previously been communicated through the butler. Ob- 
viously the purpose of this visit would have been immediately appar- 
ent even to less worldly-wise folk than Marya Aleksevna and her hus- 
band. The landlady’s son came and stayed for more than half an hour; 
he even deigned to have a cup of tea brewed from the choicest leaves. 
The very next day Marya Aleksevna presented her daughter with a 
necklace left as an unredeemed pledge; she also ordered two fine new 
dresses for her. The material alone cost 40 rubles for the first, 52 for the 
second; together with cutting, flounces, and ribbon the two dresses 
came to 174 rubles. At least that’s what Marya Aleksevna told her 
husband, while Verochka knew that she had spent a total of less than 
100 rubles (after all, she was present at the purchase); but two ex- 
tremely fine dresses can be made for 100 rubles. Verochka was de- 
lighted with them and with the necklace, but most of all she was 
delighted that her mother at long last had agreed to start buying her 
shoes at Korolyov’s.!° Shoes from the flea market were so ugly, while 
those from Korolyov’s fitted one’s feet so beautifully. 

The dresses had the intended effect: the landlady's son soon ac- 
quired the habit of visiting the manager and, it goes without saying, 
once there, he chatted more with the manager’s daughter than with 
the manager and his wife, who, it also goes without saying, made a big 
fuss over him. The mother provided her daughter with complete in- 
structions, everything she needed to know. There’s no reason to re- 
peat it all here—it’s perfectly well known. 

One day after dinner her mother said, “Verochka, change into some- 
thing a bit nicer. I have a surprise for you: we're going to the opera. | 
bought us some seats in the second circle, where all the generals’ 
wives sit. And I did it all for you, you little fool. I don’t spare even my 
last kopecks. And your father has spent so much on you that we all feel 
the pinch. We paid a small fortune to Madame for your private school; 
in addition, there was that drunken piano teacher! And you, you in- 
grate, you don’t care! No, you have no soul! You're so unfeeling!” 

That was all Marya Aleksevna said. She abused her daughter no 
longer; and what kind of abuse was it anyway? Marya Aleksevna was 
simply having one of her friendly little chats with Verochka. She'd long

Anichkov Palace on Nevsky Prospekt, the main street in St. Petersburg.

since stopped abusing her; nor had she beat her even once since she'd 
heard the rumor about her husband's department head. 

They went to the opera. After the first act the landlady’s son ap- 
peared in their box accompanied by two friends. One was a civilian, 
lean and very elegant; the other was in the military, portly and not so 
elegant. They sat down, settled in, and began to whisper among them- 
selves, especially the landlady’s son and the civilian, while the soldier 
said very little. Marya Aleksevna listened attentively and overheard 
almost every word, but she couldn’t understand much because they 
were speaking entirely in French. She recognized only four or five 
words in their conversation: belle, charmante, amour, bonheur (pretty, 
charming, love, happiness])—but what good did that do? Belle, char- 
mante—Marya Aleksevna had been hearing that her gypsy girl was 
belle and charmante for quite a while now; amour—Marya Aleksevna 
could see for herself that he was wallowing in amour; and if amour, 
then bonheur goes without saying—but what did it all mean? The big 
question is, when will he propose? 

“Verochka, youre so ungrateful, as ungrateful as can be,” Marya 
Aleksevna whispered to her daughter. “Why are you turning your face 
away from them? Have they insulted you by coming in? They've done 
you an honor, you little fool! What's the French word for ‘wedding?’ Is 
it mariage, or what, Verochka? And how about the French for ‘bride’ 
and ‘groom,’ and ‘to be married’?” 

Verochka told her. 

“No, for some reason I haven't heard those words. ... Vera, you 
must have told me the wrong ones! Be more careful!” 

“No, those are right—but you'll never hear those words from them. 
Let’s leave. I can’t stay here any longer.” 

“What? What did you say, you wretch?” Marya Aleksevna saw red. 

“Let's go. Afterward you can do anything you like to me, but I'm not 
staying. I'll tell you why later. Mother dear,” she said more loudly, “I 
have a terrible headache. I can’t stay here any longer. I beg of you!” 

Verochka stood up. 

The gentlemen began to make a fuss over her. 

“It will pass, Verochka,” said Marya Aleksevna in a stern but deco- 
rous manner. “Take a little turn in the vestibule with Mikhail Ivanovich 
and your headache will pass.” 

“No, it won't. I feel quite ill. Quickly, Mother.” 

The gentlemen held the door and tried to escort Verochka by the 
arm, but the wretch wouldn't have it. They helped the ladies on with 
their coats and saw them out to the carriage. Marya Aleksevna haugh- 
tily glanced at the footmen: “Just look, you louts, look at these fine 
gentlemen! That one will soon be my son-in-law. Then I'll have some 


56 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


louts of my own. And you, my dear, if you continue to put on airs, you 
miserable creature, I'll smack you!” But wait a minute, wait just one 
minute. What was her son-in-law saying to that arrogant wench as he 
helped her into the carriage? Santé—I think that means “health”; sa- 
voir—to find out, visite—that’s the same in our language, permettez— 
I ask permission. These words did little to diminish Marya Aleksevna’s 
wrath; still, they had to be taken into consideration. The carriage start- 
ed on its way. 

“What did he say as he helped you in?” 

“He said that he would drop by tomorrow morning to inquire about 
my health.” 

“Tomorrow morning? You're not lying, are you?” 

Verochka was silent. 

“Thank your lucky stars!” But Marya Aleksevna could restrain herself 
no longer; she yanked her daughter’s hair—only once and not too 
hard. “Well, I won't lay a finger on you. Only mind that you're cheerful 
tomorrow! Sleep well tonight, you little fool! Don't get it into your head 
to start bawling. Take care so that tomorrow you won't look too pale or 
have bloodshot eyes. I've let you off so far . . . but not for much longer. 
And I won't spare your pretty face, even if it means losing everything. 
I'll make you feel it!” 

“You know that I gave up tears a long time ago.” 

“Well, there you are! And be a little more talkative with him.” 

“Yes, I will talk to him tomorrow.” 

“Good for you. It’s about time you wised up. Fear God and honor thy 
mother, you shameless hussy!” 

Ten minutes passed. 

“Verochka, don’t be angry with me. I abuse you only because I love 
you, and I want the best for you. You don’t know how mothers dote on 
their children. Nine months I carried you in my womb! Now, Verochka, 
pay me back: be obedient. You'll see it’s for your own good. Behave as I 
tell you and tomorrow he'll propose.” 

“Mama, you’re mistaken. He isn’t even considering a proposal. If you 
only knew what they were saying!” 

“I know, all right; if it wasn’t about marriage, then we all know too 
well what it was about! I wasn’t born yesterday! We'll make him knuck- 
le under! I'll drag him off to the church in a sack, pull him around the 
altar by his whiskers—and he'll thank me for it! There’s no point in 
talking to you; I've already said too much. Young girls don't have to 
know all this—it’s a mother’s business. A girl is supposed to obey; 
you're still too young to understand anything. So, will you talk to him 
as | tell you?” 

“Yes, I will talk to him.” 


What Is to Be Done? 57 


“And you, Pavel Konstantinych, why are you sitting there like a 
bump on a log? Tell her that you, too, as her father, order her to obey 
her mother, and that her mother would never lead her astray.” 

“Marya Aleksevna, you're a very clever woman, but this is a risky 
business. Perhaps you're going too far!” 

“You idiot! Look what you've blurted out—right in front of Verochka! 
Now I'm sorry I woke you up! That old saying is correct: ‘If you don’t 
touch shit, it doesn’t stink.’ What a blabbermouth! Don’t try to think— 
just answer me: Is a daughter supposed to obey her mother or not?” 

“Of course she is. No two ways about it!” 

“Well then, as her father, order her to do so.” 

“Verochka, obey your mother in everything. She’s a clever woman, 
very experienced. She won't lead you astray. | command you as your 
father.” 

Their carriage drew up at the gate. 

“Enough, mama. I told you I would talk to him. Now I'm very tired 
and need my rest.” 

“Go to bed and sleep well. I won't disturb you. Get a good rest. You'll 
need it for tomorrow.” 

In fact, all the while they climbed the stairs Marya Aleksevna kept 
silent—and that wasn't easy! And again, when Verochka went straight 
to her room saying that she didn’t want any tea, it wasn’t easy for 
Marya Aleksevna to say with some affection, “Verochka, come here.” 
Her daughter approached. “I want to give you my blessing before you 
retire. Now Verochka, bow your head.” Her daughter did so. “May God 
bless you, Verochka, as I now do.” 

She made the sign of the cross over her daughter three times and 
held out her hand to have it kissed. 

“No, mama, I told you a long time ago that I will not kiss your hand. 
And nowlet me go. I really don't feel very well.” 

Oh, how Marya Aleksevna’s eyes were about to blaze; but she gained 
control of herself and said meekly, “Go along now and get some rest.” 

Verochka scarcely had time to undress and put awayher clothes. . . 
though in fact all this took quite a while, since she kept lapsing into 
daydreams. She removed her bracelet and then sat holding it for a long 
time; she took off her earrings and fell into a reverie again. A good long 
time passed before she remembered that she really was very tired, that 
she'd found it difficult even to stand in front of the mirror, that upon 
reaching her room she’d sunk down onto a chair in exhaustion, and 
that she really should have gotten undressed more quickly and gone 
right to bed. . . . No sooner had Verochka gotten into bed than into her 
room came Marya Aleksevna carrying a tray with Pavel Konstanti- 
nych’s very own large tea mug and a whole pile of rusks. 


58 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Have some tea, Verochka! To your health! I've brought you some 
myself: see how your mother looks after you! I was sitting down there 
thinking, ‘How is it that Verochka went to bed without her tea?’ There I 
sat drinking my own tea, thinking about you. So I brought you some. 
Drink it, my dearest daughter!” 

Verochka thought that her mother’s voice sounded odd—in fact it 
was very kind and gentle, something that had never happened before. 
She looked at her mother in astonishment. Marya Aleksevna’s cheeks 
were flushed and her eyes were wandering. 

“Have some tea. I'll just sit here a while and look at you. When you 
drink it up, I'll bring you another cup.” 

The tea, which was half thick tasty cream, aroused Verochka’s ap- 
petite. She propped herself up on one elbow and began to drink. “Tea 
tastes so good when it’s fresh and strong, especially when it’s mixed 
with lots of cream and sugar. Extraordinarily good! Not at all like 
watery tea with one small lump of sugar—that’s awful! When I can 
afford it, I shall drink tea like this.” 

“Thank you, mama.” 

“Don’t go to sleep—I'll bring you another cup.” She returned with 
more of the delicious brew. “Drink it, and I'll sit here for a while.” 

She sat in silence for a moment; then she began to talk in a peculiar 
way, first in a very rapid patter, then drawing out her words. 

“Well now, Verochka, you just said thank you. You haven't thanked 
me in quite a while! You think I'm mean. Yes, I am, but only because 
it’s impossible not to be. I’ve become a little tipsy, Verochka. I had 
three glasses of punch and now I've become a little tipsy—at my age! 
And you've upset me too, Verochka. You've distressed me deeply. So 
I've become tipsy. I've had a hard life, Verochka. I don’t want yours to 
be like it. May you live in wealth! I’ve suffered so many torments, 
Verochka, so very, very many. You don’t remember what our life was 
like before your father became the manager here. We were so poor, so 
very, very poor—and I was an honest woman then, Verochka. No 
longer! No, I won’t commit another sin, I won't lie to you, I won't tell 
you that I'm still an honest woman. No indeed, that time is long past. 
Verochka, you're an educated person and I’m not; still, I know every- 
thing that’s written in those books of yours. It says that one shouldn't 
be treated the way I was. ‘You're dishonest,’ people say. And as for 
your father—yes, he is your father, though Nadenka’s father was 
someone else—he’s a poor fool, but he too taunts and humiliates me. 
Then I was overcome by meanness. If other people say I'm dishonest, I 
might as well be! And then Nadenka was born. So what of it? Whose 
fault was that? And who was it that got a good job? My sin was less 
than his in this case. They took her away from me—off to a foundling 


What Is to Be Done? 59 


home. I could never find out where she was; I couldn’t get to see her. I 
don't even know if she’s still alive. How could she be? It doesn’t hurt so 
much any more, but back then it wasn't easy. I turned even more 
vicious! Then I turned mean. And our affairs started to improve. Who 
do you think got the job for your fool of a father? Me. And who do 
you think got him made manager? Me again. And then we started to 
live well. Why? Because I turned dishonest and mean, that’s why! I 
know, Verochka, in your books it says that only dishonest and mean 
people prosper. It’s all true, Verochka! Even your father has some 
money now—I got it for him. I have some of my own, too, maybe even 
more than he has—and I got that to support myself in my old age. And 
then your father, the fool, started to respect me. Now he’s at my beck 
and call—I have him well trained. Before that he persecuted me and 
humiliated me. For what? He didn’t need a reason, Verochka; it was 
just because I wasn’t mean enough. Your books say that we're not 
supposed to live like this. Don’t you think I know that, Verochka? But 
in those books of yours it says that in order not to live like this, 
everything has to be organized differently; now, no one can live any 
other way. So why don’t they hurry up and set up a new order? Hey, 
Verochka, do you think I don’t know anything about those new sys- 
tems described in your books? I know theyre good ones. Only you and 
I won't live to see them! People are really stupid—how can you set up 
a new system with the likes of them? So let’s keep on living in the old 
order. That includes you! What sort of a system is it? Your books say 
that the old order is one of filching and fleecing. That's true, Verochka. 
So if there’s no new order, let’s live by the old: filch and fleece. I’m 
telling you all this because I love you, becau .. . zzzz.” 
Marya Aleksevna began to snore and soon slumped over. 


ii. 


Marya Aleksevna understood what was being said at the theater, but 
she still didn’t know what was going to come out of that conversation. 

At the verysame time she lay there snoring—she had been so upset 
by her daughter that in her distress she poured a great deal of rum 
into her punch—Mikhail Ivanych Storeshnikov was having supper ina 
very fashionable restaurant with the two cavaliers who had accom- 
panied him to the theater. Another person had joined their group—a 
Frenchwoman who arrived with an officer. Supper was almost over. 

“Monsieur Storeshnik!” Storeshnikov was overjoyed: during supper 
the Frenchwoman had addressed him on three separate occasions. 
“Monsieur Storeshnik! You will allow me to call you that, won't you? It 


60 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


sounds so much nicer and it’s much easier to say. I never thought I 
would be the only woman in your company. I had hoped to see Adéle 
here. That would have been very nice, as I see her so seldom.” 

“Unfortunately, Adéle has quarreled with me.” 

The officer wanted to say something, but kept silent. 

“Don't believe him, Mademoiselle Julie,”"! said the civilian. “He’s 
afraid to tell you the truth; he thinks you'll be angry when you find out 
he’s rejected a Frenchwoman for a Russian.” 

“IT don’t know why we came here!” said the officer. 

“Why, Serge, we came because Jean asked us to! And I've so enjoyed 
meeting Monsieur Storeshnik. But, Monsieur Storeshnik, shame on 
you! What poor taste you have! I would never have objected if you’d 
forsaken Adele for that Georgian girl who was in the box with the two 
of them; but to reject a Frenchwoman for a Russian . . . Imagine! color- 
less eyes, straggly, colorless hair, and a foolish, colorless face—I'm 
sorry, not colorless, but as you say, ‘blood and cream’—some dish that 
only Eskimos can stand! Jean, pass the ashtray to that man who's 
sinned against the Graces so he can sprinkle ashes on his guilty head!” 

“You've spoken so much nonsense, Julie, that it’s you, not he, who 
should sprinkle ashes on your head,” said the officer. “The girl you call 
a Georgian is in fact that very Russian.” 

“You're joking!” 

“A pure Russian,” said the officer. 

“Impossible!” 

“You're wrong to think, my dear Julie, that there’s only one type of 
beauty in our country as there is in yours. Yes, we have many blondes. 
But we're a combination of tribes—from fair-haired, like the Finns” 
(“Yes, yes, the Finns,” the Frenchwoman took note), “to black-haired, 
much darker than the Italians, more like the Tatars or Mongols” (“Yes, 
the Mongols, I know,” the Frenchwoman took note) “—they have all 
mingled their blood with ours! Those blondes you so despise are only 
one of our local types—the most prevalent, but by no means the only 
one.” 

“That’s astonishing! But she’s magnificent! Why doesn’t she go on 
the stage? But, gentlemen, I can only speak about what I saw. There's 
still a very important question: what about her feet? I've been told by 
your great poet Karasin that in all of Russia there aren't five pairs of 
small, dainty feet.”12 

11. The character of Julie is modeled both on the heroine of Rousseau's novel Julie: 
ou La Nouvelle Héloise (see Introduction, p. 23, and n. 252 below) and on one of the 
mistresses of Nikolai Dobrolyubov (1836-1861), a radical critic who was closely associ- 
ated with Chernyshevsky on the journal Sovremennik. 


12. Julie is indicating her ignorance of and disdain for Russian culture by confusing 
Russia’s preeminent poet, Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), with the noted writer and 


What Is to Be Done? 61 


“Julie, it wasn't Karasin who said that—by the way, his name was 
Karamzin. He was a historian, and not a Russian but a Tatar.!° There 
you have additional evidence for the diversity of our types. It was 
Pushkin who talked about women’s feet. His verses were suited to his 
age, but by now they've lost most of their value. By the way, Eskimos 
live in America; our savages, the ones who drink reindeer blood, are 
called Samoyeds.!4 

“Much obliged, Serge. Karamzin was a historian; Pushkin I know; 
Eskimos live in America; and Russians have their Samoyeds. Yes, Sa- 
moyeds—it sounds so sweet—Sa-mo-yeds! From now on I'II be able to 
remember. Gentlemen, I'll have Serge tell me all this again when we're 
alone, or in different company. It's good for conversation. Besides, 
knowledge is my passion. I was born to be a Madame de Staél, gentle- 
men.!> But that’s all beside the point. Let’s return to the question of 
her feet.” 

“If you'll allow me to call upon you tomorrow, Mademoiselle Julie, I 
shall have the honor of bringing you her shoe.” 

“Yes, bring it to me; I shall try it on. It has aroused my curiosity.” 

Storeshnikov was ecstatic—and why not? He'd just managed to grab 
on to Jean’s coattail, and Jean had grabbed on to Serge’s. Julie was one 
of the leading ladies among those in Serge’s society. It was an honor, a 
very great honor, indeed! 

“Her feet are all right,” Jean confirmed. “But as a positive sort,!® I’m 
interested in something more substantial. I surveyed her bust.” 

“She has a fine bust,” said Storeshnikov, encouraged by such favor- 
able reactions to the object of his predilection and concluding that 
now he could pay Julie a compliment, something he’d never dared 
before. “She has an enchanting bust, although, of course, to praise 
another woman’s bust in present company is a sacrilege.” 


historian Nikolai Karamzin (1766-1826) (see n. 13 below). The reference is to Pushkin's 
novel in verse, Eugene Onegin (1825-1833): “Search Russia through, you'll scarce discov- 
er / Three pairs of truly dainty feet” (1:30). 

13. A writer of sentimentalist literature, Karamzin also produced several important 
historical works justifying autocratic rule in Russia. By referring to the Tatar origin of 
Karamzin’s paternal ancestry, and thus associating him with the Mongol occupation, 
Chernyshevsky may be criticizing Karamzin’s conservative ideology as well as insulting 
him personally. 

14. A nomadic, primarily reindeer-herding people inhabiting regions of northern 
Siberia; now called Nentsy. 

15. The French-Swiss belle-lettriste Germaine de Staél (1766-1817) presided over an 
influential Parisian political and cultural salon until 1803, when she was exiled for her 
opposition to Napoleon. Moving to Coppet, near Lake Geneva, she once again attracted a 
brilliant literary circle and became an early popularizer of German romanticism. 

16. A reference to the displacement among younger Russian intellectuals of philo- 
sophical idealism, especially Hegelianism, by the materialist ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach 
and the positivist theories of August Comte (see nn. 41 and 108 below). 


62 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Ha, ha, ha! This gentleman wishes to compliment my bust! I’m 
neither a hypocrite nor an imposter, Monsieur Storeshnik. I don’t 
praise myself, nor can I tolerate others’ praise for my deficiencies. 
Thank heaven I still have enough to be genuinely proud of. But my 
bust—ha, ha, ha! Jean, you've seen my bust—tell him! Youre still 
silent, Jean! Your hand, Monsieur Storeshnik.” She grabbed his hand. 
“You see, that’s not really me! Feel over here ... and here. Now you 
know! I wear a false bust just as I wear a dress, a skirt, or a chemise, 
and not because 1 like to (I think it better to do without such hypocrisy) 
but because it’s what’s expected in society. But for a woman who's 
lived as much as I— and how I've lived, Monsieur Storeshnik. . . . Now 
I’m a saint or a nun compared to what I was before. Such a woman 
cannot hope to preserve her bust!” Suddenly she burst into tears. “My 
bust! my bust! my innocence! Oh, God, why was I ever born? 

“You're liars, gentlemen,” she shouted, jumping up and banging her 
fist on the table. “Slanderers! You're all base! She's not his mistress. He 
wants to buy her. I saw how she turned away from him, how she 
burned with indignation and hatred. This is vile!” 

“Yes,” said the civilian, stretching lazily, “you were rather boasting, 
Storeshnikov. Your affair still hasn’t reached its climax, yet you claim 
to be living with her. Why, you even broke up with Adele in order to 
convince us. Yes, you described it all so well, but you were describing 
what you haven't yet seen. Never mind, it's not important. If it didn’t 
happen a week ago, then it will a week from now—it's all the same. 
And you won't be disappointed by your imaginary descriptions; you'll 
find her even better than you thought. I’ve examined her; you'll be 
satisfied.” 

Storeshnikov was beside himself with rage. “No, Mademoiselle Julie, 
I assure you you're mistaken. Forgive me for daring to contradict you, 
but she is my mistress. What you observed was an ordinary lovers’ 
quarrel resulting from jealousy. She saw that I spent the first act sitting 
in the box next to Mademoiselle Mathilde. And that’s all there is to it!” 

“You're lying, my friend, lying,” said Jean and yawned. 

“I’m not lying, not at all.” 

“Prove it. I'm a positive sort and cannot be convinced without 
proof.” 

“What kind of proof can I produce?” 

“Now youre in retreat and proving that you're a liar. What kind of 
proof? It's not hard to find. Now then, tomorrow we'll all gather here 
again for dinner. Mademoiselle Julie will be so kind as to bring Serge, I 
shall bring my nice little Berthe, and you shall bring her. If you do, 
then I'll have lost and will pay for dinner. If you don't, then you'll be 
expelled from our circle in disgrace.” Jean rang for the waiter. “Simon, 


What Is to Be Done? 63 


be a good fellow: tomorrow I should like to order supper for six, just 
like when I got married to Berthe—you remember, just before Christ- 
mas?—and in the same room as then.” 

“How could I forget a supper like that, Monsieur? It shall be done.” 

The waiter left. 

“What vile, base people! For two years I worked as a streetwalker in 
Paris, for another six months I lived in a house frequented by thieves, but 
never did I encounter such despicable characters as the three of you. 
My God, the company I’m forced to keep in society. What have I done 
to deserve such shame, O Lord?” She sank to her knees. “Oh, God, I am 
a weak woman. I was able to bear hunger, but those winters in Paris 
were so cold. It was so hard and the temptations were so great. I 
wanted to live and to love. Oh, God, surely it wasn't really a sin. So why 
are you punishing me now? Take me away from this circle of people, 
lift me out of this slime! Grant me strength to become a streetwalker in 
Paris again. I ask for nothing more—I’m unworthy of anything else. 
But deliver me from these people, these vile men!” She jumped up and 
ran toward the officer: “Serge, are you like them? No, you're better!” 
(“Better,” replied the officer imperturbably.) “Isn't this disgusting?” 

“Disgusting, Julie.” 

“But you stay silent? You permit it? Do you agree with it? Will you 
take part in it?” 

“Come and sit on mylap, my dear Julie.” He began to caress her and 
she calmed down. “How I love you at moments like this! You're a fine 
woman. Why don’t you agree to marry me? How many times have I 
asked you? Say yes! 

“Marriage? The yoke? Prejudice? Never! I won't even allow you to 
talk about such nonsense. Don’t make me angry. But . . . Serge, dear 
Serge! Forbid him. He’s afraid of you—save her!” 

“Calm down, Julie. That's impossible. If it isn’t he, it'll be someone 
else—it’s all the same. Look here, Jean is already hoping to win her 
over for himself. And there are thousands like him, you know. When a 
mother decides to sell off her daughter, you can’t protect her from 
everyone. As we Russians say, there's no use beating your head against 
a brick wall. We're a clever people, Julie. You see how serene mylife is, 
having accepted this Russian principle?” 

“Never! Youre a slave, but a Frenchwoman is free. She struggles— 
she falls, but she struggles. I won't allow it! Who is she? Where does 
she live? Do you know?” 

“I do.” 

“Let's go to her. I'll warn her.” 

“At one o'clock in the morning? Let's go to bed instead. Good-bye, 
Jean. Good-bye, Storeshnikov. Obviously you shouldn't expect us at 


64 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


your supper tomorrow night. You see how distraught she is. To tell 
you the truth, I don’t like this affair much either. Of course, you don’t 
care about my opinion. Good-bye.” 

“The frenzied Frenchwoman,” said the civilian, stretching and 
yawning after Julie and the officer left. “She is an exciting woman, but 
this is a bit too much. It’s nice to see a fine woman sulk, but I couldn't 
put up with her for four hours, let alone four years. Needless to say, 
Storeshnikov, our supper won't be ruined because of her whims. I'll 
bring Paul and Mathilde instead of them. And now it’s time we all went 
home. I must drop in on Berthe and then go on to see my little Lotta, 
who is so very sweet.” 


iil. 

“Well, Vera, good for you! No tear-stained eyes. Obviously you realize 
that your mother is telling the truth, or else you'd be rearing up on 
your haunches.” Verochka showed signs of impatience. “All right, all 
right, I won’t carry on. Don't get upset. Last night, before I fell asleep in 
your room, I may have said too much. I wasn’t in very good shape 
yesterday. You should never believe anything I say when I'm drunk. Do 
you hear? Don't believe a word of it!” 

Verochka recognized the old Marya Aleksevna once again. Yesterday 
it had seemed that a few human traits were peeking through the 
bestial cover; but now she was a beast once again. Verochka made an 
effort to stifle the disgust she felt, but she couldn't. Once she had 
merely despised her mother; yesterday it seemed to her that she 
would stop hating her and might only pity her. But now she experi- 
enced that hatred again, though the pity was still there. 

“Get dressed, Verochka! He'll be here soon.” She scrutinized her 
daughter's attire. “If you behave yourself, I'll give you a nice pair of 
earrings with big emeralds. They're a bit old-fashioned, but they could 
be remade into a fine brooch. They were pawned for one hundred and 
fifty rubles—two-fifty with the interest— so they cost more than four 
hundred. You hear me, I'll give them to you.” 

Storeshnikov arrived. Yesterday he’d spent a long time trying to 
figure a way out of the mess he’d made. He’d walked home from the 
restaurant and thought all along the way. By the time he arrived home 
he was calm—he’d come up with a plan—and now he was very satis- 
fied with himself. 

He inquired about Vera Pavlovna’s health. “Just fine,” she replied. He 
expressed relief and then declared that one should always make the 
best of good health. “Of course one should.” And, in Marya Aleksevna’s 
opinion, “of one’s youth as well.” He agreed completely and wondered 


What Is to Be Done? 65 


if they might not like to take advantage of the evening for a little drive 
out of town; the weather was frosty, the road inviting. “With whom 
does he propose to drive?” “Why, just the three of us: you, Marya 
Aleksevna, Vera Pavlovna, and I.” In that case Marya Aleksevna was in 
complete agreement. For now, she would go fix some coffee and a little 
snack while Verochka would sing something. “You will sing, Verochka, 
won't you?” added her mother in a tone of voice that allowed for no 
objections. “Yes, I will,” replied the daughter. 

Verochka sat down at the piano and sang “The Troika’—a song that 
had recently been set to music. Marya Aleksevna, who was eavesdrop- 
ping on the other side of the door, considered this a good choice: in 
the song a young girl is making eyes at an officer. “That Verka is clever 
when she wants to be. A real minx!” Soon Verochka stopped singing — 
just as she should. Marya Aleksevna had given strict orders: first sing, 
then chat. Now Verochka was talking—but, to Marya Aleksevna’s an- 
noyance, it was all in French. “What a fool I am! I forgot to tell her to 
speak in Russian!” But Vera was talking softly, and smiling—that must 
mean that everything's still all right. But why are his eyes starting to 
bulge? Well, he’s a fool—and that’s what makes him a fool—all he can 
do is stare and blink. Just the kind of fool we need. There, she’s letting 
him hold her hand. That Verka has become smarter. I’m proud of her.” 

“Monsieur Storeshnikov, I must speak with you in all seriousness. 
Last night you took a box at the opera in order to exhibit me to your 
friends as your mistress. I won't say that it was dishonest of you: if you 
were capable of understanding that, you wouldn't have done it. But 
I’m warning you: if you dare approach me in the theater, on the street, 
anywhere—then I shall slap your face. My mother may torment me” 
(at this point Verochka smiled); “come what may, it doesn’t really mat- 
ter to me. This evening you'll receive a note from my mother saying 
that our drive has been canceled because I'm not feeling well.” 

He stood there and stared blankly, just as Marya Aleksevna had ob- 
served. 

“I’m speaking to you as if you lacked even a single spark of honor. 
But perhaps you're not yet entirely depraved. If so, then I beseech you: 
stop visiting us. In that case I could forgive even your slander. If you 
agree, give me your hand.” She extended hers: he took it, not really 
understanding what he was doing. 

“Thank you. Now go. Say that you must leave to prepare the horses 
for our drive.” 

He blinked some more. She had already turned back to her music 
and resumed singing “The Troika.” It’s a pity there were no con- 
noisseurs present. It would have been curious to hear: surely they 
seldom have the opportunity of hearing a song sung with such feeling. 


66 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Perhaps there was even a little too much feeling; it was a bit too 
unaesthetic. 

A moment later Marya Aleksevna entered, followed by the cook car- 
rying a tray with coffee and a snack. Instead of sitting down, Mikhail 
Ivanych edged his way toward the door. 

“Leaving so soon, Mikhail Ivanych?” 

“I must make haste, Marya Aleksevna, to prepare the horses for this 
evening.” 

“Why, there’s plenty of time, Mikhail Ivanych.” But he was already 
out the door. 

Marya Aleksevna rushed back from the hallway with upraised fists. 

“What on earth have you done, damn you, Verka? Huh?” But the 
accursed Verka was no longer in the drawing room. Her mother fol- 
lowed her to the bedroom, but her door was locked. Marya Aleksevna 
hurled all her weight against the door to break it down, but the door 
didn’t budge, and the accursed Verka replied, “If you break down my 
door, I'll break the window and shout for help. You won't take me 
alive.” 

Marya Aleksevna raged for a long time but didn’t break down the 
door. Finally she grew tired of shouting. Then Verochka said: “Mother, 
I merely used to dislike you before; but after last night I began to pity 
you, too. You've known so much grief: that’s why you are what you are. 
I didn’t talk to you before, but now I want to, but only when you've 
stopped being angry. Then we'll have a good chat, better than ever 
before.” 

Needless to say, Marya Aleksevna did not exactly take these words to 
heart, but her exhausted nerves needed a rest; it also occurred to her 
that it might even be better to enter into negotiations with her daugh- 
ter, since the wench was getting completely out of hand. Without 
Vera’s agreement, nothing could be done: there was no way of marry- 
ing her off to that fool Mishka unless she was willing. And Marya 
Aleksevna still had no idea what Verka said to him—after all, they did 
hold hands. What did it all mean? 

Thus sat the weary Marya Aleksevna, alternating between ferocity 
and cunning, when suddenly the doorbell rang. It was Julie and Serge. 


iv. 


Julie’s very first words upon awakening that morning were “Serge, 
does her mother speak French?” 

“IT don’t know,” he replied. “You still haven't given up that little 
scheme of yours?” 


What Is to Be Done? 67 


No, she hadn't. Furthermore, after taking into account various clues 
related to the evening at the opera and determining that the girl’s 
mother probably did not speak French, Julie took Serge along as inter- 
preter. It would have been his fate to tag along in any case, even if 
Verochka’s mother had been Cardinal Mezzofanti.!” Serge didn’t com- 
plain; he accompanied Julie everywhere, much like the heroine’s con- 
fidante in one of Corneille’s tragedies.18 Julie had awakened late, had 
called in at Weichmann’s!9 along the way, and then at four more stores 
not along the way because she needed to. As a result, Mikhail Ivanych 
had time to explain himself, and Marya Aleksevna had time to fly into a 
rage and calm down again, while Julie and Serge made their way from 
Liteiny Street to Gorokhovaya. 

“And what pretext shall we give for our visit? Phew, what a foul 
staircase! Why, even in Paris I never saw one like this!” 

“Never mind—any pretext that occurs to you. Her mother’s a pawn- 
broker: take off your brooch. Wait, even better: the girl gives piano 
lessons. We'll say that you have a niece.” 

When she caught sight of Serge’s uniform and Julie’s splendor, Ma- 
tryona, for the first time in her whole life, felt ashamed of her bruised 
cheek. She’d never before been face to face with such an imposing 
lady. Marya Aleksevna felt a similar reverence and indescribable aston- 
ishment when Matryona announced the arrival of a colonel and his 
wife. Especially the wife. Gossip that reached Marya Aleksevna’s ears 
usually came from no higher level in society than that of low-ranking 
civil servants; gossip about real aristocrats usually died out some- 
where in the ether, well before reaching her. Therefore, she conferred 
the full legal meaning on the terms “husband” and “wife” which Serge 
and Julie exchanged after the Parisian fashion. Marya Aleksevna re- 
covered her wits quickly and came rushing in. 

Serge said that he was delighted to have made their acquaintance 
the previous evening, etc., etc.; that his wife had a niece, etc., etc.; and 
that since his wife didn’t speak Russian, he had come along to inter- 
pret. 

“Yes, I thank the Lord,” said Marya Aleksevna, “that Verochka has the 
talent to give piano lessons. And I'd consider it an honor if she were to 
be accepted into a house as fine as yours. However, our little piano 
teacher isn’t feeling too well today.” Marya Aleksevna spoke quite

Bologna who reputedly knew nearly fifty languages. 

18. The French dramatist Pierre Corneille (1606-1684), whose main female characters 
frequently have confidantes. Considered the father of French classical tragedy, Corneille 
contributed to the flowering of French drama in the seventeenth century and is best 
known for his play Le Cid (1637).

loudly so that Verochka would hear her and realize that a truce was 
being offered; she herself, in spite of all her reverence, stared at her 
guests. “I don’t know if she’s feeling strong enough to come out and 
play something for you on the piano. Verochka, my dear, are you 
coming out or not?” 

With strangers present, there wouldn't be a scene—so why not 
come out? Verochka unlocked her door, glanced at Serge, and blushed 
from shame and anger. 

Even a set of poor eyes would have noticed her reaction; but Julie’s 
eyes were sharper perhaps than even Marya Aleksevna’s. The French- 
woman came right to the point. 

“My dear child, you’re surprised and embarrassed to see the man in 
whose presence you were so insulted last night, and who probably 
had a hand in your humiliation. My husband is frivolous, but he’s still 
better than those other rakes. Forgive him for my sake. I’ve come to 
you with good intentions. The lessons for my niece are merely a pre- 
text, but one we must preserve. Play something for me—the shorter 
the better—and then we'll go into your room and have a nice long talk. 
Heed my words, my child.” 

Is this the Julie who is known to all the aristocratic young men of 
Petersburg? Is this the woman whose pranks have caused even rakes 
to blush? No, surely this is a princess, whose ears have never been 
defiled by so much as a single rude word. 

Verochka sat down to play her exhibition piece. Julie stood nearby 
while Serge had a conversation with Marya Aleksevna to ascertain the 
extent of her involvement with Storeshnikov. In a few minutes Julie 
interrupted Verochka, took her by the waist, walked up and down a 
bit, and then led her off to her room. Serge explained that his wife was 
satisfied with Verochka’s playing, but wished to have a little chat with 
her, since it was essential to investigate the character of any piano 
teacher, etc., etc.; he continued to steer their conversation back to 
Storeshnikov. This was all well and good, except that Marya Aleksevna 
was becoming more vigilant and a little suspicious. 

“My dear child,” said Julie upon entering Verochka’s room, “your 
mother is a very wicked woman. But if I am to know how to talk with 
you, I must first ask you why you were in the theater last night. I 
already know why from my husband, but I will come to understand 
your character from your account of it. Don’t be afraid of me.” After 
hearing Verochka’s tale, she declared, “Yes, I can talk with you; I see 
that you have the requisite strength of character.” In very tactful and 
delicate terms Julie told her about the previous night's wager. To this 
Verochka replied with the story of the proposed drive. 

“Well, is he hoping to deceive your mother or are they conspiring 
together against you?” Verochka fervently asserted that her mother 


What Is to Be Done? 69 


was not so wicked a woman as to be involved in such a conspiracy. “I'll 
see about that at once,” said Julie. “You stay here—you aren't needed 
out there right now.” Julie returned to the drawing room. 

“Serge, he’s already invited this woman and her daughter out for a 
drive this very evening. Tell her about dinner last night.” 

“My wife likes your daughter; now we need only set the price. I feel 
sure we won't disagree on that score. But let me finish the conversa- 
tion about our mutual acquaintance. You have nothing but praise for 
him. Did you know that he speaks quite candidly about his relations 
with your family—for example, his purpose in inviting us into your 
box at the opera last night?” 

The inquisitive glance before her went unnoticed as the thought 
flashed through Marya Aleksevna’'s head: “So that’s it!” 

“Iam no gossip,” she answered with displeasure. “I neither carry 
tales nor listen to them!” This was said with some acrimony, despite 
the reverence she felt for her guest. “Young men say all sorts of things 
to each other; it’s nothing to worry about.” 

“Very well, but is this also what you would call gossip?” Then he 
began to describe the events at the dinner. Marya Aleksevna did not 
allow him to finish. At his first mention of the wager, she jumped up 
and roared in a fury, completely forgetting the important status of her 
visitors. 

“So that’s what he’s up to! What a blackguard! What a scoundrel! 
That's why he invited us out for a drive! He wanted to get me outside of 
town and then dispatch me to kingdom come in order to dishonor a 
defenseless girl. The filthy swine!” and so on and so forth. Then she 
began to thank her visitor for saving both her life and her daughter's 
honor. “The fact is, my dear sir, right from the start I guessed you had 
some special reason for coming here; a piano lesson is only a lesson, 
but I knew you had some ulterior motive. Only I had something else in 
mind. I thought you had another bride picked out for him, and you 
wanted to snatch him away from us. I have sinned against you, ac- 
cursed woman that I am. Be generous and forgive me! Now I can say 
that you've done us a great favor—one that will last us to the grave,” 
and so on and so forth. Numerous curses, words of gratitude, and 
apologies flowed forth in a disorderly stream. 

Julie did not listen very long to this endless speech—the meaning of 
which was apparent to her from the tone of voice and the gestures. At 
Marya Aleksevna’'s very first words, the Frenchwoman rose and re- 
turned to Verochka’s room. 

“Well, your mother was not his accomplice and now she's very 
angry at him. But I know people like her very well: they have no 
feelings whatever that can withstand financial considerations; soon 
she'll set about finding you another match, and God knows how it will 


70 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


end. In any case, it won't be easy for you. She'll leave you in peace fora 
little while, but I assure you it won't be for long. What will you do now? 
Do you have any relatives in Petersburg?” 

“No.” 

“That's a pity. Do you have a lover?” Verochka didn’t know how to 
answer that question; she merely opened her eyes very wide in a 
strange sort of way. “Forgive me, please forgive me; it’s obvious that 
you don't, but that’s even worse. It means you have nowhere to go. 
What shall we do? Well, listen. I’m not what I seem. I’m not his wife, 
I’m a kept woman. I am known throughout Petersburg as a very wick- 
ed woman, but I am really very honest. If you come to me, it will mean 
the end of your reputation. It’s dangerous enough that I've set foot in 
your apartment once; if I came here again, it would probably mean 
your ruin. Still, we must see each other again, perhaps more than 
once—that is, if you trust me. You do? Then when would you be 
available tomorrow?” 

“Around noon,” replied Verochka. That was a little early for Julie, but 
no matter, she would ask to be awakened and would meet Verochka in 
the shopping arcade directly across from Nevsky Prospekt. It was the 
nearest one and would be the easiest place for them to find each 
other; besides, no one there would know Julie. 

“Yes, and here's a good idea: give me some paper so I can write that 
blackguard a letter that will get him under control.” Julie wrote: “Mon- 
sieur Storeshnikov. You are no doubt in a great predicament at the 
moment. If you wish to escape from it, be at my place at 7 p.m. J. Le 
Tellier.” “Now, farewell.” 

Julie held out her hand, but Verochka rushed to embrace her; she 
kissed her, wept, and kissed her again. Julie was unable to hold herself 
back for long; she was not nearly so restrained in her tears as Ver- 
ochka. She was deeply moved by joy and pride, knowing what a good 
deed she was doing. She became ecstatic; she talked and talked 
through tears and kisses, and concluded with the exclamation “My 
friend, my dear child! God forbid that you should ever know what I feel 
now, when, after so many years, unsullied lips touch mine. May you 
perish rather than ever bestow a loveless kiss!” 


Vv. 


Storeshnikov’s plan was not so murderous as Marya Aleksevna had 
supposed; in her own way she had given the affair too crude a form, 
but she had discerned its essence. Later that evening Storeshnikov 
planned to steer the two ladies to the restaurant where the dinner was 


What Is to Be Done? 71 


to take place; by that time they would be cold and hungry, in need of 
warmth and a cup of tea. He would slip some opium into Marya 
Aleksevna’s goblet or cup; Verochka would lose her head when she 
saw her mother pass out; he would lead her into the room where his 
friends were gathered for dinner—and the wager would be won! After 
that, it hardly mattered. Perhaps in her confusion Verochka wouldn't 
understand anything and would agree to remain in unfamiliar com- 
pany; and even if she were to walk out immediately, it wouldn’t matter 
a bit. They would excuse it, since she’d only just embarked on the life 
of an adventuress; naturally she'd be a little embarrassed at first. Then 
he'd settle things with Marya Aleksevna with the help of some money 
—at that point, of course, there’d be nothing she could possibly do 
about it. 

But now what could he do? He cursed his boastfulness in front of 
his friends and his slow-wittedness in the face of Verochka’s sudden, 
sharp resistance. He wanted the earth to open and swallow him up. 
And it was in just such a state of mind that he received Julie's letter— 
healing balm to his wound, a ray of sunshine through impenetrable 
darkness, a firm roadway under the feet of a man sinking in a bottom- 
less pit. Oh, she would help, that cleverest of all women, she would 
think of something, that noblest of all women! At ten minutes before 
seven he was standing at her door. “The mistress is expecting you. You 
may go in.” 

How majestically she was sitting; how sternly she looked at him! She 
scarecly nodded her head in answer to his bow. “I’m very glad to see 
you. Please be seated.” She moved not a muscle of her face. He would 
receive a stern dressing down. Never mind: abuse me, but save me. 

“Monsieur Storeshnik,” she began in cold, measured tones. “You 
know my opinion of this affair that brings us together; I needn’t go over 
it again. I have seen that young person about whom we spoke yester- 
day; I have heard about your visit to her today; consequently, I know 
everything and am glad to be spared the painful necessity of inter- 
rogating you. Your predicament is crystal clear, both to you and to 
me.” (“Lord, it would be much better if she abused me,” thought the 
defendant.) “It seems to me that you cannot possibly extricate yourself 
without somebody's help, and that you are unable to count on effec- 
tive assistance from anyone but me. If you have any objection to what 
I've said thus far, I’m waiting. Therefore” (after a pause), “you agree that 
there's no one but me in a position to help you. Then listen to what I 
can and will do for you. If what I propose seems appropriate, then I 
will state the conditions under which I am willing to assist you.” 

And in the same long-drawn-out style of an official document, she 
said she could send Jean a letter to the effect that after yesterday's 


72 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


outburst she had reconsidered, that now she wished to participate in 
the dinner, but had a previous engagement for that evening and there- 
fore would ask Jean to persuade Storeshnikov to postpone the affair; 
she would arrange the date with Jean later. She read him the letter: in 
it Storeshnikov heard her conviction that he would win the wager and 
her opinion that he would be annoyed at having to delay his triumph. 
“Will this letter do?” “By all means.” In that case, continued Julie in the 
same long-drawn-out official manner, she would dispatch the letter 
on two conditions. “You may accept them or not; if you do, I will send 
the letter; if you don't, I will burn it,” and so on and so forth, in the 
same endless style that was driving the poor man out of his mind. The 
conditions, at long last. There were two of them: “First, you cease all 
pursuit of the young person in question; second, you refrain from 
mentioning her name in any conversation.” “That's all?” thought Sto- 
reshnikov. “I was worried—who knew what the devil she’d demand, 
and what the devil I'd be ready to do.” He agreed; his face radiated joy 
at the leniency of the conditions. But Julie did not relent one bit; she 
kept on and on, explaining everything. . . . “The first condition is nec- 
essary for her; the second also, but even more so for you. I shall 
postpone the dinner for one week, then another, and soon the whole 
affair will be forgotten. But you must understand that the others will 
forget only if you refrain from mentioning so much as a single word 
about the person in question ...” and so on and so forth. And she 
kept explaining and demonstrating, even the fact that the letter would 
be received by Jean in time. “I've made inquiries; he is dining at 
Berthe’s,” etc. “He will leave for your place after he finishes his cigar,” 
etc., and on and on in the same manner. Or, for example, she went on 
in this way: “And so the letter is to be dispatched and I am very glad. 
Be so kind as to reread it. I do not enjoy your trust, nor do I demand it. 
Have you read it? Now be so kind as to seal it yourself. Here’s an 
envelope. I shall ring. Pauline, be so kind as to deliver this letter,” etc. 
“Pauline, I did not receive Monsieur Storeshnikov today; he was never 
here. Do you understand?” This excruciating process of salvation 
dragged on for almost an hour. At last the letter was dispatched and 
Storeshnikov breathed more easily, even though sweat was pouring 
from him. 

Julie continued: “In a quarter of an hour you will have to hurry 
home so that Jean can find you there. But rest assured that I shall use 
these next fifteen minutes to say a few more words to you. It’s up to 
you whether you follow my advice or not, but you must consider it 
carefully. I will not speak about an honest man’s obligations toward a 
young woman whose name he’s compromised. I know our fashionable 
young people too well to expect any good to come of that! But I believe 
that marriage to the young person in question would be very beneficial 


What Is to Be Done? 73 


for you. As a straightforward woman, I shall expound on the founda- 
tions of this opinion with great clarity, although some of what I have to 
say may be a bit delicate for your ears. However, one small word from 
you will be enough and I'll stop. You are a man of weak character and 
in danger of falling into the hands of some evil woman who would 
torment you and trifle with you. She is kind and generous; therefore 
she won’t hurt you. Marriage to her, in spite of her humble origins and 
relative poverty, would significantly advance your career. Were she to 
be introduced into society with your financial means and her own 
beauty, intelligence, and strength of character, she would soon come 
to occupy a dazzling position. The advantages would be obvious for 
any man. But, aside from those that any husband would acquire by 
having such a wife, you, with your own particular personality, have 
more need than most for guidance—or, I shall say it outright—for 
supervision. Each one of my words has been carefully weighed and is 
based upon my observation of her. I don’t demand trust, but I do 
recommend that you consider my advice carefully. I doubt very much 
that she would accept your offer; but if she did, it would be extremely 
advantageous for you. I shall not detain you any longer. You must 
hurry on home now.” 


vi. 


Of course Marya Aleksevna stopped nagging Verochka for refusing to 
go on the drive once she realized that Mishka-the-fool was not such a 
fool, and that he had almost managed to put one over on her. Ver- 
ochka was left in peace and the next morning she headed off for the 
shopping arcade without any interference. 

“It’s freezing here and I don't like the cold,” said Julie. “We must go 
somewhere else. But where? Wait a moment, I'll just drop into this 
shop and be right back.” She bought a thick veil for Verochka. “Put this 
on—now you can visit me without danger. Don't lift the veil until 
were alone. Pauline is very discreet, but I still don’t want her to see 
you there. I’m too concerned about your welfare, my child!” In fact, 
Julie herself was wearing her maid’s hat and coat as wellas a thick veil. 
After warming herself, Julie heard Verochka’s news and told her all 
about her meeting with Storeshnikov. 

“Now, my child, there’s no doubt that he'll propose to you. That type 
falls madly in love as soon as his advances are rejected. Do you know, 
my dear, that you treated him as if you were an experienced coquette? 
Coquetry—and I mean the genuine article, not its stupid, amateur 
imitations (they are revolting, just like any bad imitation of a good 
thing)—coquetry entails intelligence and tact applied to a woman's 
dealings with a man. For that reason quite naive young women, if only 


74 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


they possess intelligence and tact, sometimes behave like experienced 
coquettes without intending to. Perhaps my arguments will also have 
some effect on him, but the main thing is your resolve. Be that as it 
may, he will propose to you and I advise you to accept him.” 

“You—who yesterday said that it’s better to die than bestow a single 
loveless kiss?” 

“My dear child, that was said in a moment of distraction; it’s all well 
and good at such times! But life consists of prose and calculation.” 

“No, never, never! He is disgusting and the whole thing is repulsive! I 
shall not debase myself! Let them devour me—I'll throw myself out 
the window. I'll go begging in the streets. I would rather die than give 
my hand to such a vile, base man.” 

Julie began to list the advantages: you'll escape from your mother's 
persecution; you'll end the danger of being sold off; he’s not an evil 
man, just not too bright; a man who’s not evil yet not too bright makes 
the best kind of husband for a clever woman of character; you'll be 
mistress of your own house. She described in vivid colors the position 
of some actresses and dancers who don't submit in love to their men 
and who dominate them. “This is the best possible position for a 
woman in society, except when, at least as far as society is concerned, 
the woman receives not only independence and power but formal 
legal recognition of such a position—that is, when a husband relates 
to his wife as an admirer does to an actress.” She spoke at some length, 
as did Verochka; they both grew heated. Finally Verochka reached the 
point of pathos: 

“You call me a dreamer and ask what I want out of life. I prefer 
neither to dominate nor to submit. I wish neither to deceive nor to 
dissemble. I don’t want to be concerned about other people's opin- 
ions, or strive for what others advise, when I really have no need for it. I 
have not become accustomed to wealth, and have no need for it my- 
self. Why should I seek it only because others consider that it’s good to 
have and therefore that it would be good for me? I've not been in 
society and have never experienced what it means to be dazzling; it 
still doesn't attract me. Why should I make sacrifices for a brilliant 
position only because other people think it’s valuable? I'm unwilling to 
sacrifice not only myself but even my slightest whim for something I 
really don’t need. I want to be independent and live in my own way. I 
am eager to acquire only what I really need; what I don’t need, I don't 
want and won't want. I don’t knowyet what I'll need later. You say that 
I’m young and inexperienced and that in time I'll change. So what? 
When I change, then I will; but for now, I don’t want a thing, nothing 
that I myself don’t desire. And you ask me what I want now: well, I 
don’t even know myself. Do I want to love a man? I don’t know. When I 
awoke yesterday morning, I didn’t even know that I would want to love 


What Is to Be Done? 75 


you; for several hours before I did, I didn’t know that I would, nor did I 
know how I would feel when I did. So now I don’t know how I would 
feel if 1 loved a man; I know only that I don’t want to submit to anyone. 
I want to be free; I don’t want to be obligated to anyone for anything. I 
don't want anyone ever to say, ‘You're obligated to do this for me!’ I 
want to do only what I desire and want others to do likewise. I don't 
want to demand anything from anyone. I don’t want to impinge on 
anyone's freedom and I want to be free myself.” 

Julie listened and thought, pondered and blushed—for she was 
unable to refrain from bursting into fire when a flame was burning so 
close to her. She jumped up and in a voice breaking with emotion 
burst out: 

“Yes, my child, it’s just as it should be! I would feel that way myself if 
I weren't so corrupted. I haven’t been corrupted by being what the 
world calls a ‘fallen woman,’ or by the life I've lived, experienced, and 
suffered, or by the desecration to which my body has been subjected. 
No, I was corrupted by the fact that I became accustomed to idleness 
and luxury, that I wasn’t strong enough to live on my own, that I had 
need for others. Therefore I tried to please, and had to do things I 
didn’t want to do. That's what corruption is! Don’t listen to what I said 
to you, my child; I was trying to corrupt you. What a torment! I cannot 
come into contact with purity without defiling it. Avoid me, my child, 
I'm avile woman. Don't think about society. Everyone in it is repulsive, 
worse than I am. Where there’s idleness, there's vileness, where there's 
luxury, there’s vileness. Run away, my child, run away.”

More and more Storeshnikov thought, “What if I actually do up and 
marry her?” Something was happening to him that is quite common in 
the lives not only of people like him who are not self-sufficient, but 
even of those who possess an independent character, and even in the 
history of whole peoples. The books of Hume?° and Gibbon,?! Ranke22 


20. The Scottish empiricist philosopher, skeptic, and historian David Hume (1711- 
1776), whose chief works include A Treatise on Human Nature (1739-1740) and The 
History of England from Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688 (1754-1762). 

21. The English historian Edward Gibbon (1737-1794), whose History of the Decline 
and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-1788) emphasized the importance of each civiliza- 
tion’s social and administrative institutions in shaping historical events. Gibbon’s expla- 
nation of the decay. of Roman institutions was meant in part to demonstrate that 
European civilization need not decline. 

22. The German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), whose efforts to transform 
history into an objective science, particularly through the rigorous analysis of primary 
sources, have continued to influence historical research and writing.

and Thierry”? are full of such incidents. People carry on in one direc- 
tion simply because they've yet to hear the words “Why not try the 
other way, my friend?” They hear that and immediately begin to turn 
around and go off in the other direction. Storeshnikov saw and heard 
that rich young men acquire poor but pretty young women as mis- 
tresses. Well, he’d tried to make Verochka his “mistress”; no other 
word had occurred to him. Now he heard some different words: “Take 
a wife.” So he started thinking along that new line, just as he had 
previously thought about having a “mistress.” 

This is a general characteristic, one in which Storeshnikov very ade- 
quately represented some nine-tenths of the human race. Historians 
and psychologists maintain that in every individual occurrence the 
common factor is “particularized” (as they say) by local, temporal, 
racial, and personal circumstances, and that it’s these particulars that 
are crucial; that is, while each and every spoon remains a spoon, each 
and every person eats his broth or cabbage soup with his very own 
spoon, the one he holds in his hand, and it’s precisely that spoon 
which should be examined. So why not examine it? 

Julie had already stated the most important point (as if she'd been 
reading Russian novels, in which the same point is always made): 
resistance inflames desire. Storeshnikov had become accustomed to 
the notion that he would “possess” Verochka. Just like Julie, I too like 
to call vulgar things by their real names, using the same crude, base 
language in which almost all of us constantly think and speak. For the 
last several weeks Storeshnikov had occupied himself with imagining 
Verochka in different “poses,” and he wanted to see these fantasies 
realized. It turned out that she would not fulfill them in the role of 
mistress; well then, let her do it as wife—it didn’t matter. The main 
thing was not what part she played, but the “poses,” that is, the “pos- 
session.” What filth, what pure filth— “possession.” Who dares possess 
another person? One can possess a bathrobe or a pair of slippers. Yet, 
what nonsense: almost every one of us men possesses one of you, our 
sisters. Again, I say, what nonsense: how are you our sisters? You are 
our lackeys! Some of you—even many of you—dominate us; never 
mind—many lackeys exercise power over their masters. 

After the evening at the theater, Storeshnikov’s fantasies about Ver- 
ochka’s poses became inflamed as never before. Having shown his 
friends the mistress of his imagination, he realized that the mistress 
was much better than even he had dreamed. The vast majority of men 
come to appreciate beauty fully, just like intelligence or any other

Thierry (1795-1856) later wrote several historical works in which he accepted the divi- 
sion of society into competing classes but denied the inevitability of conflict among 
them.

virtue, only after hearing the general consensus. Anyone can see that a 
pretty face is pretty, but how can one know how pretty it really is until 
its worth has been awarded a diploma? Naturally, no one noticed 
Verochka when she was seated in the balcony or in the back rows of 
the stalls; but as soon as she appeared in a box in the second tier, a 
large number of binoculars were trained on her. And what praises 
Storeshnikov heard sung as he escorted her into the lobby! And Serge? 
Why, he was a man with the most refined tastes! What about Julie? No 
... When such happiness comes along, there's no reason to agonize 
over what one calls the “possession” of it. 

Storeshnikov's self-esteem was inflamed along with his sensuality, 
but it was also affected by the statement “I doubt that she'll accept 
you.” What? How could she not accept him—with his uniform and his 
house? No, you are lying, Madame Frenchwoman! She'll accept me, 
she will, of course she will! 

There was one more reason of a similar nature. Storeshnikov's 
mother would naturally oppose the match. In this case his mother 
was a representative of society. Up to now Storeshnikov had been 
afraid of his mother, and of course he was oppressed by his depen- 
dence on her. People who have no character are strongly attracted by 
the thought: “I’m not afraid. I have character.” 

There was also, naturally, the desire to use his wife to advance his 
career in society. 

And, in addition to all this, Storeshnikov dared not approach Ver- 
ochka in his former role; and yet he was dying to see her. 

In a word, with every passing day Storeshnikov’s desire to get mar- 
ried grew stronger and stronger. A week later, on Sunday, when Marya 
Aleksevna had returned from late mass and was considering how she 
might trap him, he himself appeared and made his proposal. Since 
Verochka refused to come out of her own room, he was able to speak 
only with her mother. Marya Aleksevna, of course, said she would 
consider it a great honor, but that as a loving mother, she was obliged 
to consult her daughter. She asked that he be so kind as to return and 
receive an answer the following morning. 

“That's my Vera! Well done, the wench!” Marya Aleksevna said to her 
husband, astonished at such a sudden turn of events. “Just look at 
how she caught that fellow! All the while I kept thinking and thinking 
and couldn't figure out a way! I thought it would be very difficult to 
lure him back. I thought the whole affair was ruined—but no, my 
turtledove didn't spoil it after all; instead she brought about a happy 
ending. She knew how to behave! She's a sly one, she is!” 

“The good Lord is making the child wise,” intoned Pavel Konstan- 
tinych. 

He rarely played any role whatever in domestic life. But Marya Alek- 


78 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


sevna was a staunch guardian of good, old-fashioned customs, and on 
such a ceremonial occasion as a proposal for their daughter, she as- 
signed to her husband the honorable role that rightfully belongs to the 
head of a family and master of a house. Pavel Konstantinych and 
Marya Aleksevna sat themselves down on the divan, a most solemn 
place, and told Matryona to ask the young mistress to join them. 

“Vera,” began Pavel Konstantinych, “Mikhail Ivanych is doing us a 
great honor by asking for your hand in marriage. We replied that as 
loving parents we would not coerce you, but we ourselves would be 
very pleased. Inasmuch as you are the good, obedient daughter we 
have always known, you can rely on our experience. We never dared 
ask God to send us such a fine suitor. Will you accept him, Vera?” 

“No,” she replied. 

“What did you say, Vera?” shouted Pavel Konstantinych. The whole 
matter was so clear that even he could shout without consulting his 
wife as to how he ought to behave. 

“Have you gone mad, you foo]? I dare you to repeat that, you disobe- 
dient wench!” shouted Marya Aleksevna, raising her fists at her daugh- 
ter. 

“Excuse me, mother,” said Vera rising. “If you so much as touch me, 
I shall leave this house at once. If you lock me up, I shall throw myself 
out the window. I knew how you would take my refusal, and I have 
decided what to do. Sit down and stay seated or else I'll leave.” 

Marya Aleksevna sat down once again. “How stupid I was not to lock 
the front door,” she thought. “She'll throw open the bolt in a second 
and out she'll go. There'll be no stopping her. She’s mad!” 

“T will not marry him. And, without my consent, I cannot be mar- 
ried.” 

“Vera, you're out of your mind,” said Marya Aleksevna gasping for 
breath. 

“How can this be? What will we tell him tomorrow?” asked her 
father. 

“You're not to blame because I won't agree.” 

This scene continued for another two hours. Marya Aleksevna 
raged; twenty times or so she began to shout and clench her fists, but 
Verochka said: “Don't get up or else I'l] leave.” They ranted and raved, 
but got nowhere. It all came to an end when Matryona walked in and 
asked whether she should serve dinner—the meat pie was overdone. 

“Think it over until this evening, Vera—and think better of it, you 
fool!” said Marya Aleksevna aloud and then whispered something to 
Matryona. 

“Mother, are you trying to do something to me? Take the key out of 
the door to my room or something else? Don't: it will only make things 
worse.” 


What Is to Be Done? 79 


Marya Aleksevna said, “Don't bother,” to the cook. “What kind of a 
beast is she, that Verka? If only he weren't taking her for her pretty 
face, I'd make it black and blue. But how can I touch her? She'll 
disfigure herself, damn her!” 

They went in to dinner. They ate in silence. After dinner Verochka 
went to her room. As usual Pavel Konstantinych lay down to have a 
snooze. But to no avail; he’d hardly begun to doze when Matryona 
entered and announced that the landlady’s servant had come. She 
was demanding to see Pavel Konstantinych at once. Matryona was 
shaking like an aspen leaf. Why on earth? 


Vili. 


Why shouldn't she be shaking, since this sorry state of affairs had 
come about all because of her? No sooner had she summoned Ver- 
ochka to her mother and father than she ran over to tell the landlady's 
cook’s wife that “your master has proposed to our young mistress.” In 
turn they called in the landlady’s youngest maid and accused her of 
being an unworthy friend for not having shared the news with them 
sooner. The youngest maid couldn't understand why they were accus- 
ing her; she'd never hidden a thing from them. When they told her the 
news, she replied, “It’s the first I've heard of it!” They apologized for 
casting aspersions on her devotion. She went to pass the news along 
to the elder maid, who said, “This must have happened without his 
mother’s knowledge, since I've heard nothing about it, and I’m sup- 
posed to know everything that Anna Petrovna knows.” So she went to 
inform her mistress. That's how Matryona caused the whole mess! 
“Damn my big mouth—it’ll be the end of me.” She knew that Marya 
Aleksevna would eventually discover how the news leaked out. As it 
turned out, however, Marya Aleksevna never did discover how the 
news leaked out. 

Anna Petrovna moaned and groaned; twice she fainted—alone with 
the elder maid, which indicated just how upset she was. Then she 
sent for her son. He entered. 

“Michel, is it true what I hear?” she asked in a tone of irate suffering. 

“What have you heard, maman?” 

“That you have proposed to that... that .. . that manager's daugh- 
ter?” 

“T have, maman.” 

“Without consulting your mother?” 

“I would have asked for your consent after receiving hers.” 

“I assume that you could feel more assured of receiving her consent 
than mine.” 


80 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Maman, nowadays this is how it’s done: you get the girl's consent 
first, then inform your family.” 

““How it’s done’? Maybe ‘how it’s done’ is for the sons of good 
families to marry God knows what and for their mothers to give their 
consent!” 

“Maman, she's not ‘God knows what’; once you get to know her, 
you'll approve my choice.” 

““Once I get to know her’! I'll never get to know her! ‘Approve your 
choice’? I forbid you any further thoughts about your choice! Do you 
hear? I forbid it!” 

“Maman, this is not how it’s done nowadays. I’m no longer a little 
boy for you to lead by the hand. I know what I'm doing.” 

“Ah!” Anna Petrovna closed her eyes. 

Mikhail Ivanych had yielded to Marya Aleksevna, Julie, and Ver- 
ochka—but they were women of intelligence and character. Here, as 
far as intelligence was concerned, the battle was evenly matched, and 
if his mother had a slight edge in character, still her son was standing 
on solid ground. Up to now he'd feared his mother out of sheer habit; 
however, both of them were well aware that the “landlady” was not in 
fact the landlady, but only the landlord's mother, and that the “land- 
lady's son” was not in fact the landlady’s son, but the landlord. For 
that reason the “landlady” was very slow to pronounce the decisive 
words “I forbid.” She dragged out the conversation, hoping to wear her 
son down and to exhaust him before it became an all-out battle. But 
her son had gone too far; there was no turning back. He had no choice 
but to persevere. 

“Maman, I assure you that you couldn't wish for a better daughter.” 

“Monster! Matricide!” 

“Maman, let's discuss it calmly. Sooner or later I have to get married; 
a married man has more expenses than a single one. Of course, I could 
always marry the kind of woman who would need all the income from 
the house to support a family. But Vera will make you a very respectful 
daughter and we could continue living together as before.” 

“Monster! Murderer! Get out of my sight!” 

“Maman, don’t be angry. I've done nothing to wrong you.” 

“Marrying some tramp—and he’s done nothing to wrong me!” 

“Well, maman, now I will get out of your sight. I won't allow you to 
call her such names in my presence.” 

“Murderer!” Anna Petrovna fainted, and Michel left, well satisfied 
that he’d conducted the first (and most important) skirmish very suc- 
cessfully. 

Seeing that her son had left, Anna Petrovna curtailed her faint. He 
was definitely getting out of hand. In reply to her saying, “I forbid you,” 


What Is to Be Done? 81 


he said that the house belonged to him! Anna Petrovna racked her 
brains and vented her sorrow to the elder maid, who, in this case, 
completely shared her feeling of contempt for the manager's daughter. 
After consulting her, she sent for the manager. 

“Up to this point, Pavel Konstantinych, I've been very satisfied with 
you; but now these intrigues in which you may not even be participat- 
ing could force me to quarrel with you.” 

“Your Excellency, as God is my witness, I've done you no wrong.” 

“I've known for some time that Michel has been running after your 
daughter. I haven't interfered because a young man can't live without 
diversions. I indulge young men’s foolish pranks. But I'll not tolerate 
any disgrace to our family. How did your daughter dare conceive such 
notions?” 

“Your Excellency, she dared no such thing. She's an obedient girl. 
We brought her up with respect.” 

“What exactly do you mean to say?” 

“Your Excellency, she would never dare oppose your will.” 

Anna Petrovna couldn't believe her own ears. Could such good for- 
tune really and truly be hers? 

“You must know what my wishes are. . . .I cannot consent to sucha 
strange, one might even say indecent match.” 

“We can appreciate that, Your Excellency, and Verochka can, too. 
Why, she even said, ‘I wouldn't dare, says she, ‘offend Her Excellen- 


cy.” 

“Well, how did it all happen?” 

“It happened, Your Excellency, when Mikhail Ivanovich declared his 
intentions to my wife and she told him that she couldn’t make any 
reply until tomorrow morning. My wife and I fully intended, Your 
Excellency, to come straight to you and inform you about it, but we 
dared not disturb Your Excellency at so late an hour. And when Mi- 
khail Ivanovich left, we told Verochka, and she said, ‘I agree with you 
completely, papa and mama; we shouldn't even think about it.’” 

“So she’s a sensible and honest girl?” 

“Of course, Your Excellency, and respectful, too!” 

“Well, I'm very glad indeed that we can stay friends. I shall reward 
you for this. I’m even prepared to reward you now. That apartment on 
the second floor, off the main entrance, near the tailor—it’s empty, 
isn’t it? 

“It'll be vacated in three days, Your Excellency.” 

“It’s yours. You can spend up to one hundred rubles to redecorate 
it. And I'm giving you a raise of two hundred and forty rubles a year.” 

“Please allow me to kiss Your Excellency’s hand!” 

“Yes, yes. Tatyana!” The elder maid entered. “Bring in my blue velvet 


82 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


coat. This is a gift for your wife. It cost me a hundred fifty rubles” 
(actually only eighty-five) “and I've worn it only twice” (actually more 
than twenty times). “And here's a present for your daughter.” Anna 
Petrovna gave the manager a very small lady’s watch. “I paid three 
hundred rubles for it” (actually only one hundred twenty). “I know 
how to reward; nor will I forget in the future. I indulge young people's 
foolish pranks.” 

Having dismissed the manager, Anna Petrovna called Tatyana once 
again. 

“Ask Mikhail Ivanych to come in—no, wait. It'll be better if I go in to 
see him.” She was afraid that her messenger would convey the gist of 
the manager's news to her son’s lackey and that he in turn would tell 
her son; then the bouquet of flowers would wither, so to speak, and 
the force of her words wouldn't have quite the same effect on her son. 

Mikhail Ivanych was lying down and twirling his mustache with 
considerable satisfaction. “What on earth does she want now?” he 
wondered. “I don't have any smelling salts in here!” He got up when 
his mother entered, but he saw a look of contemptuous triumph on 
her face. 

She sat down and said, “Take a seat, Mikhail Ivanych. Let’s have a 
little chat.” She smirked at him for some time. At last she said, “I’m very 
pleased, Mikhail Ivanych. Can you guess why?” 

“IT don't know what to think, maman. You're behaving so strange- 
ae 
“You'll see that it’s not really so strange; just think a little bit and 
perhaps you'll guess why.” 

Another long silence. He was in a quandary while she savored her 
triumph. 

“You can’t guess? Then I'll tell you. It’s very simple and natural. If 
you had even a spark of nobility, you’d have guessed. Your lover .. .” 
In their earlier conversation Anna Petrovna had minced her words, but 
now there was no reason to do so. Her enemy had been deprived of 
the means to defeat her. “Your lover—don't object, Mikhail Ivanych, 
you yourself have declared that she’s your lover—that creature of low 
origin, poor breeding, and bad manners—even that despicable crea- 
ture...” 

“Maman, I don’t wish to hear such words used to describe the 
young woman who will soon become my wife.” 

“I wouldn't have used them if I ever supposed that she would be- 
come your wife. But I began with the aim of explaining that this will 
never be and why it will never be. Allow me to finish. Then you'll feel 
free to reproach me for any words you still consider inappropriate. As 
for now, allow me to finish. I wish to say that your lover, that creature 


What Is to Be Done? 83 


without a name, with no upbringing, manners, or feeling—even she 
has put you to shame, even she has understood the full indecency of 
your intention... .” 

“What? What are you saying, maman? Tell me!” 

“You're the one causing the delay! I wish to say that even she—do 
you understand, even she—was able to understand and appreciate 
my feelings, even she, after learning of your proposal from her own 
mother, sent her father to inform me that she would never oppose my 
wishes and would not dishonor our family with her besmirched 
name.” 

“Maman, are you deceiving me?” 

“To my great good fortune and yours, I am not. She says that . . .” 

But Mikhail Ivanych was no longer in the room. He was on his way 
out, throwing on his overcoat. 

“Hold him, Peter, hold him!” shouted Anna Petrovna. Peter stood by 
gaping at such an extraordinary order while Mikhail Ivanych was al- 
ready descending the stairs.

“Well, what happened?” Marya Aleksevna asked her husband when 
he returned. 

“Everything's fine, my dear. She knew everything already, and said, 
‘How dare you?’ I said, ‘We don't, Your Excellency. Vera has just re- 
fused him.” 

“What? What did you say? Is that what you blurted out, you stupid 
ass?” 

“Marya Aleksevna .. .” 

“Ass! Scoundrel! Murderer! Assassin! Here's what you get!” She 
slapped her husband's face. “And here!” Again. “Let that be a lesson to 
you, you moron!” She seized his hair and began to pull. This lesson 
must have lasted quite a while because Storeshnikov, upon rushing 
into their drawing room at the conclusion of his mother’s admonitions 
and long pauses, still found Marya Aleksevna’s instruction in full 
swing. 

“You ass! You didn't even lock the door! Strangers can walk in and 
see God knows what! You should be ashamed, you swine!” That was all 
Marya Aleksevna could find to say. 

“Where's Vera Pavlovna? I must see her at once. Is she really going to 
refuse me?” 

Circumstances were so difficult that Marya Aleksevna could only 
throw up her hands. The same thing happened to Napoleon after the 


84 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Battle of Waterloo, where Marshal Grouchy had proved to be as stupid 
as Pavel Konstantinych, and Lafayette had begun to make a row like 
Verochka. Napoleon had fought and struggled, had achieved great 
feats of military art, but all to no avail; he could only throw up his 
hands and say, “I give up. Let everyone do what they want with them- 
selves and with me.”24 

“Vera Pavlovna! Are you really refusing my offer?” 

“Judge for yourself. How can I not refuse you?” 

“Vera Pavlovna! I've offended you cruelly. I'm guilty and deserve to 
be shot, but I can’t bear your refusal,” and so on and so forth. 

Verochka listened to him for several minutes. Finally it was time to 
put a stop to it: it was too painful. 

“No, Mikhail Ivanych, enough. Stop. I cannot consent.” 

“If that’s the case, I beg you for one mercy: at the moment your're still 
too keenly aware of my insult. . . . But don’t give me your answer now. 
Let me have some time to earn your forgiveness. I may appear base 
and mean to you, but watch: perhaps I'll mend my ways. I shall make 
every effort to do so. Help me! Don’t push me away now. Give me some 
time. I'll do anything you say. You'll see how obedient I can be. Per- 
haps you'll even discover some good in me. Just give me time.” 

“I pity you,” said Verochka. “I recognize the sincerity of your love.” 
(Verochka! This isn’t love at all! It’s a mixture of tawdry vulgarity and 
filthy rubbish! That’s not what love is! Not every man who finds it 
upsetting to have his offer refused actually loves the woman! That's 
not love at all. But Verochka still doesn’t know all this and she’s 
touched.) “You don’t want me to give you my answer now. All right. But 
I'm warning you: a delay will lead nowhere. I shall never give you any 
other answer than the one I gave you today.” 

“Tl earn it; Pll earn another answer. You'll save me!” He seized her 
hand and began to kiss it. 

Just then Marya Aleksevna entered the room; in a sudden burst of 
emotion she wanted to bestow her blessing on these dear children 
without going through any formalities, that is, without Pavel Konstan- 
tinych; afterward she would summon him and they would bless the 
couple again formally. Storeshnikov shattered half her joy when he 
explained, with many kisses, that although Vera Pavlovna hadn't yet 


24. Some historians have argued that Napoleon would have prevailed at Waterloo if 
Marshal Grouchy (1766-1847) had pursued the retreating Prussian army more energet- 
ically and attempted more assiduously to join his own forces with the main French 
army. In the political turmoil surrounding Napoleon's attempted return, the Marquis de 
Lafayette (1757-1834) advocated replacing the reactionary Louis XVIII (1755-1824; king of 
France from 1814) with his allegedly more liberal Orléanist rival, Louis Philippe (1773-— 
1850), who eventually succeeded to the French throne in 1830. 


What Is to Be Done? 85 


given her consent, she hadn't refused; she had postponed her answer. 
It was not very good news, but it was much better than before. 

Storeshnikov returned home victorious. There was more talk about 
income from the house and once again Anna Pavlovna had no choice 
but to resume fainting. 

Marya Aleksevna had absolutely no idea what to think about Ver- 
ochka. In both word and deed her daughter appeared to be contra- 
dicting her wishes. But now it turned out that her daughter had over- 
come all obstacles that had stymied Marya Aleksevna. To judge by the 
progress of this affair, it seemed that Verochka was hoping for the 
same outcome as she, Marya Aleksevna; however, being the learned 
and refined person she was, her daughter was manipulating the mate- 
rial in a different way. But if that was the case, why didn't she say to 
Marya Aleksevna, “Mama, calm yourself. I want the same thing as you.” 
Or does she resent me so much that in a matter like this, where we 
both need to work together, she wants to proceed without her moth- 
er? Marya Aleksevna could easily understand why Verochka would 
postpone her answer: she wanted to teach her suitor such a good 
lesson that he wouldn't dare draw a single breath without her permis- 
sion, and so that his mother, Anna Petrovna, would be forced into 
submission. She was obviously more cunning even than Marya Alek- 
sevna. When she thought about it, her reflections brought her to just 
such a conclusion. But Marya Aleksevna’s eyes and ears were con- 
stantly seeing evidence to the contrary. What if her conclusions were 
wrong? If her daughter had no real intention of marrying Storeshni- 
kov? She was such a wild beast—Marya Aleksevna had no idea how to 
tame her. In all likelihood that worthless Verka didn’t want to get 
married—that was beyond doubt. Marya Aleksevna had too much 
common sense to be deluded by her own cunning conclusion that 
Verochka was a skillful schemer. But this girl was arranging it so that if 
she did marry him (and the devil only knows what she had in mind— 
perhaps even that!), then she would be the undisputed mistress— 
holding sway over her husband, his mother, and even the house. What 
was there left to do? Wait and see—nothing more. Right now Verka 
still doesn’t want it, but she could get used to the idea, stranger things 
have happened. .. . She might even come to want it. One might even 
intimidate her a bit—only at the right time. But for now, one can only 
wait until that time comes. So Marya Aleksevna waited. Nevertheless, 
the conclusion that Verka was moving toward a match, although in 
complete opposition to her own good common sense, was still very 
tempting. Everything, except for Verochka’s words and actions, con- 
firmed this interpretation. The suitor behaved as smooth as silk. His 
mother protested for three weeks or so, but the son kept returning to 


86 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


the question of the house, and his mother began to yield. She ex- 
pressed a desire to make Verochka’s acquaintance, but Verochka 
would not go to see her. At first Marya Aleksevna thought that had she 
been in Verochka’s place, she would have behaved more cleverly, even 
gone to see her; but after she gave it some thought, she realized that it 
was much more clever not to go. Oh, what a sly trick! Indeed, two 
weeks later, Anna Petrovna herself dropped in, under the pretense of 
wishing to inspect the redecoration of the new apartment. She was 
very cold, scathingly gracious. After hearing two or three biting words, 
Verochka withdrew to her own room. Until she actually left, Marya 
Aleksevna thought that she really shouldn't leave, that she should 
counter with even sharper words. But after Verochka left, Marya Alek- 
sevna understood at once: yes, it was best to leave. Let her son finish 
her off. Two weeks later Anna Petrovna dropped in again, this time 
without any pretext for the visit; she simply said that she’d come for a 
visit and made no caustic remarks in Verochka’s presence. 

And so time passed. The suitor gave Verochka gifts; they were pre- 
sented through Marya Aleksevna and of course remained in her pos- 
session, just like Anna Petrovna’s watch—but not all of them. The less 
expensive ones were passed along to Verochka; Marya Aleksevna said 
they were unredeemed items left in pawn. After all, the suitor ought to 
see a few gifts displayed on his intended. When he did see them, he 
became convinced that Verochka had decided to accept his propos- 
al—why else would she have accepted his presents? But why the 
delay? He understood, and Marya Aleksevna explained; she was wait- 
ing until Anna Petrovna’s spirit was completely broken. . . . And with 
redoubled ardor he ran his mother through her paces—an occupa- 
tion that provided him no little pleasure. 

Thus Verochka was left in peace; she was even pampered. She found 
this base servility disgusting and tried to be in her mother’s presence 
as little as possible. Marya Aleksevna no longer dared enter her daugh- 
ter’s room; when Verochka sat there—which she did almost all day 
long—she was never disturbed. Occasionally she would allow Mikhail 
Ivanych to call upon her. He was as obedient as a child. When she told 
him to read, he would do so with the fervor of a student preparing for 
an examination. He gained very little from his reading; still he got 
something out of it. She tried to help him. He found conversation more 
comprehensible than books and made some progress—slow, mini- 
mal, but progress nonetheless. He began to treat his mother with a 
little more decency—preferring the bridle to the longe to keep her in 
check. 

Three or four months passed in this way. There was a truce; tran- 
quillity prevailed—but on any day the storm could break. Verochka’s 


What Is to Be Done? 87 


heart was heavy with such painful waiting. If not today, then tomor- 
row—either Mikhail Ivanych or Marya Aleksevna would start pestering 
her again and demand her consent. Surely they weren't going to en- 
dure the wait forever. 

If I wanted to create powerful confrontations, I would provide a 
thunderous resolution for this predicament. In fact, it wasn't like that 
at all. If I wanted to entice you with uncertainty, I wouldn't be telling 
you now that nothing of the sort took place. But since I'm writing 
without setting any traps, I'll say in advance that there will be no 
thunderous confrontation; this predicament will be resolved without 
storm, thunder, or lightning. 


CHAPTER TWO 


First Love and Legal Marriage 


It’s well known how such situations would have turned out in the 
old days. A fine young girl from a vile family with a vulgar man whom 
she doesn’t like forced upon her as a suitor; he’s a worthless, good-for- 
nothing character who would have gotten even worse, except that 
once taken under tow, he submits; little by little he starts to approxi- 
mate an ordinary fellow—if not a good one, then at least not too bad a 
one either. At first the girl won't have him at all; then she begins to get 
accustomed to having him under her control. She becomes convinced 
that he represents the lesser of two evils—that is, between a husband 
like him and a family like hers, he’s the lesser evil, and eventually she 
makes her admirer a very happy man. At first she’s disgusted to learn 
what it means to make him a very happy man in the absence of love, 
but her husband is so very obedient. As we say, you may even come to 
like it once you get used to it. She develops into an ordinary, upstand- 
ing lady—that is, a woman good in and of herself, but one who be- 
comes reconciled with mediocrity, and merely whiles away her life on 
earth. This is how it used to be with splendid young women and 
splendid young men—they all became good people who also lived on 
earth for no good reason, except to while their lives away. This was the 
way it was then because there were so few decent folk; the crop in the 
old days was so small that, as the proverb says, each ear of corn stood 
so far from the others that not one could make itself heard even by 
shouting. But neither a young man nor a young woman can live life all 
alone without withering; therefore they would either wither or be- 
come reconciled to mediocrity. 

But nowadays other options are becoming more and more available: 
decent people have begun to meet one another. This development is 


88

inevitable, since each year the number of decent people has been 
growing. In time it will be the most common option; in even more time 
it will become the only option because all people will be decent. Then 
everything will be very wonderful indeed. 

Everything is fine with Verochka now. That's why I’m recounting her 
story (with her permission), since, as far as I know, she’s one of the first 
women whose life was arranged so well. The earliest examples retain 
historical interest: the first swallow always attracts considerable atten- 
tion from northerners. 

The episode that marked the turning point of Vera's life was as 
follows. The time came to prepare her younger brother to enter the 
gymnasium.5 Verochka’s father began to solicit from among his co- 
workers the name of an inexpensive tutor. One of his colleagues rec- 
ommended a medical student named Lopukhov. 

Lopukhov had given some five or six lessons before he and Verochka 
set eyes on each other. He worked with Fedya at one end of the 
apartment, while she kept to her own room at the other. As the date of 
Lopukhov’s exams at the Academy neared, he moved his lessons from 
the morning to the evening because he needed his mornings to study. 
Arriving one evening, he found the whole family at tea. 

There were familiar people sitting on the divan: the pupil's father 
and mother. The young lad was sitting on a chair next to his mother. A 
little way off sat an unfamiliar person—a tall, slender young woman, 
with a rather dark complexion and black hair—“nice, thick hair’— 
and dark eyes—“nice eyes, very nice eyes” —and with a southern type 
of face, “as if born in the Ukraine, or more likely the Caucasus. No 
matter, it’s a very pretty face, only rather cold—not at all southern in 
that respect. She looks healthy: if all people were that healthy, there’d 
be fewer of us medics around. Yes, indeed, she has a healthy blush 
and an ample bosom—she'll never need a stethoscope. When she 
enters society she'll produce quite an impression. All the same, I’m 
really not interested in her.” 

Meanwhile, she looked at the tutor as he entered the room. No 
longer a youth, the student was of medium height, a little taller than 
average, with dark chestnut-colored hair, regular, even handsome fea- 
tures, and a proud, bold look—“not bad, and probably kind, but too 
serious.” 

She didn't add, “All the same, I'm really not interested in him,” 


25. The principal secondary school in the tsarist educational system. Most gym- 
naziya were established after the statutes on school organization of 1803 and 1804, 
which provided for the founding of such a school in each provincial capital. The 
curriculum emphasized classical studies and prepared students for entrance to univer- 
sities as well as for service in the state bureaucracy.

because that question had never even occurred to her. Hadn't Fedya 
already told her so much about him that she was bored to death? 
“He’s very kind, sister, but not too talkative. I told him, sister, that you 
were the beauty around here, and he says, ‘So what of it?’ And, sister, I 
told him, ‘Everyone loves a beauty.’ And he says, ‘Everyone's stupid.’ 
And I said, ‘Don’t you?’ And he says, ‘I have no time.’ And, sister, I 
asked him, ‘So you don’t want to make Verochka’s acquaintance?’ And 
he says, ‘I have a lot of acquaintances already.’ Fedya blurted all this 
out right after his first lesson and blathered on in the same way with 
several additions: "So, sister, today I told him that everyone looks at 
you wherever you go. And, sister, he says ‘Good for her.’ Then I said, 
‘Don’t you want to have a look at her?’ And he says, ‘I'll get to see her 
soon enough.’” And afterward, “And then, sister, I told him what dain- 
ty hands you have, and he says, ‘You just feel like chattering—can't 
you find something more interesting to go on about?” 

The tutor learned from Fedya everything there was to know about 
his sister. Lopukhov tried to stop him from talking about family affairs, 
but how do you prevent a nine-year-old child from blurting out every- 
thing unless you intimidate him? You may manage to interrupt him by 
the fifth word or so, but by then it’s too late. Children begin without 
any preface—they proceed straight to the heart of the matter. So, 
mixed in with all sorts of comments on various family matters, the 
tutor heard the following observations: “My sister has such a rich 
suitor! But mama says he’s stupid!” “Mama’s working hard to woo 
Vera’s suitor!” “Mama says my sister has snared her suitor very skill- 
fully!” “Mama says, ‘I’m clever, but Verochka’s even cleverer!’” “Mama 
says we'll drive his mother out of the house,” and so on and so forth. 

Naturally, being in possession of such information about each other, 
these two young people had little desire to become acquainted. So far, 
however, we know only that this was “natural” on Verochka’s part. She 
hadn't reached that stage of development where she would attempt to 
“subdue the savage” or “tame the brute.’ She had no other fish to fry. 
She was glad to be left in peace. She was like a battered and tormented 
person who had somehow managed to assume a position where her 
broken arm had stopped throbbing and the pain in her side had 
abated. She was afraid to stir, lest the previous aches return in all her 
joints. Why should she be interested in making any new acquain- 
tances, especially among other young people? 

Yes, that’s the way it was with Verochka. But what about him? He 
was a loner, according to Fedya, whose head was stuffed with books 
and anatomical specimens—which constitute the greatest pleasure 
and the sweetest nourishment for the soul of a good medical student. 
Or had Fedya slandered him? 


What Is to Be Done? 91 


ii. 


No, Fedya hadn't slandered him. Lopukhov was precisely that kind 
of student whose head was stuffed with books (which ones, we'll soon 
see as a result of Marya Aleksevna’s bibliographical research) and with 
anatomical specimens. Unless your head was stuffed full of anatomical 
specimens, it was impossible to become a professor. And Lopukhov 
was planning to become one. But just as we see that he’d learned very 
little about Verochka from the information communicated to him by 
Fedya, we must supplement the information provided by Fedya about 
the tutor, so that we may get to know him better. 

As far as his finances were concerned, Lopukhov belonged to a very 
small minority of medical auditors—that is, students with no govern- 
ment stipends—who manage to live without starving or freezing to 
death. Exactly how they manage, and on what means, God only 
knows—it’s totally incomprehensible to mortals. But our story has no 
need to treat at length people suffering from nutritional deficiencies; 
therefore it will include only two or three details about the time when 
Lopukhov found himself in such indecent circumstances. 

He found himself in such a position for a very brief period—three 
years or so, even less. Before he entered the Medical Academy he'd 
enjoyed an abundance of nourishment. His father was a petty bour- 
geois from Ryazan who lived well for his station, that is, his family had 
meat in their cabbage soup even when it wasn’t Sunday and they 
drank tea every day of the week. Somehow he’d managed to send his 
son to a gymnasium, in addition, from the age of fifteen, his son began 
to contribute by giving lessons. The father’s resources were insuffi- 
cient to support the son in Petersburg. Still, during each of his first two 
years, Lopukhov received thirty-five rubles from home, and he man- 
aged to earn almost as much himself by copying documents freelance 
in one part of the Vyborg district.2® It was precisely and only during 
this period that he experienced great hardship. He had no one to 
blame but himself: he was on the verge of being awarded a government 
stipend, except that he’d become involved in some sort of argument 
and was “put out to pasture.” When he was in his third year, his affairs 
began to mend. The assistant to the local policeman offered him some 
lessons; then he began to find some more; during the last two years he 
was no longer existing in such need. He lived in the same apartment 
for over a year, in not one room but two—which meant that he wasn’t

predominantly working-class area of St. Petersburg. It lay on the other side of the Liteiny 
(Foundry) Bridge from the more fashionable part of the city.

poor—along with another fortunate young man named Kirsanov. 
They were the greatest of friends. Both had become accustomed early 
to struggling to overcome obstacles without assistance. In general, 
there were many similarities between them; if you encountered them 
separately, each one would appear to have the very same character. 
But if you met them together, you would observe that, even though 
they were both very candid and solid men, Lopukhov was somewhat 
more reserved, while his colleague was more expansive. Now we see 
only Lopukhov,; Kirsanov will appear much later. And as for Lopukhov 
considered apart from Kirsanov, we can only note what must be re- 
peated later about Kirsanov. For example, Lopukhov was preoccupied 
by arranging his life after graduation, an event that was only a few 
months away both for him and for Kirsanov. The two men had identi- 
cal plans for the future. 

Lopukhov knew for certain that he would become an intern in a 
military hospital in Petersburg; that was considered to be a fortunate 
placement—and soon he would receive a chair at the Academy. He 
didn’t want to have a private practice. It’s a curious thing: in the last 
ten years or so a number of our best medical students have decided 
upon graduation not to practice medicine—the only vocation that 
affords a medic the means of earning a decent living. At the first 
opportunity, they drop medicine and take up one of its auxiliary sci- 
ences—physiology, chemistry, or something of that sort. But every one 
of them knows that if he had a private practice, he would have a major 
reputation by the age of thirty, a secure life by the age of thirty-five, and 
by forty-five—great wealth. But they reason differently: you see, medi- 
cine is now in such an undeveloped state that, rather than treat pa- 
tients, it's more important to prepare for the future so that doctors will 
possess the skill to administer treatment. And so, in the name of their 
beloved science (they delight in abusing medicine, even though they 
devote all their efforts to it), they reject wealth, even prosperity, and, 
you see, they sit in hospitals making interesting scientific observations. 
They dissect frogs, cut open hundreds of corpses a year, and at the 
first opportunity they outfit themselves with a chemical laboratory. 
The degree of seriousness with which they pursue these steadfast 
intentions depends of course on the arrangement of their domestic 
circumstances. If it's not required by their nearest and dearest, they 
may never practice medicine; that is, they relegate themselves to near- 
poverty. If compelled by family necessity, however, they engage in only 
enough private practice to support their family, that is, a very small 
amount. And they only treat patients who are genuinely ill and can 
actually be treated, given the pitiful state of contemporary medicine— 
that is, not a very lucrative clientele. Lopukhov and Kirsanov belonged 


What Is to Be Done? 93 


to this group of young people. They were scheduled to complete their 
course at the end of the year and had announced that they would take 
the exams (or, as they say in the Academy, “sit the exams”) in order to 
receive their medical degrees. Now they were both working on their 
doctoral dissertations, using up an enormous quantity of frogs. Both 
had chosen to specialize on the nervous system; strictly speaking, they 
were working together. But, as far as the actual presentation of their 
dissertations was concerned, their work was distinct. Each entered 
into his record of data only those facts that, though observed by both, 
were relevant to the subject of his own dissertation. 

Now, at last, it’s appropriate to speak exclusively about Lopukhov. 
There was a time when he was a rather serious drinker; this happened 
when he had no money for tea and sometimes none for boots. That 
kind of period is extremely conducive to bouts of drinking, not only 
because of a person's predisposition but also because of the enhanced 
possibility: it’s cheaper to drink than to feed and clothe oneself. But 
his drinking came about as a consequence of depression over his 
intolerable poverty—and nothing more. As for the present, there's 
rarely been a man who has abstained for so long—and not only with 
regard to alcohol. In the old days Lopukhov had engaged in a rather 
large number of romantic adventures. Once, for example, it so hap- 
pened that he fell in love with a touring dancer. What to do? He 
pondered and schemed, and finally set off for her apartment. “What do 
you want?” “I've been sent by Count So-and-So with a letter.” The 
servant easily mistook his student uniform for that of a clerk or a 
special orderly. “Give me the letter. Will you wait for an answer?” “The 
Count ordered me to wait.” The servant returned and announced with 
astonishment: “You're invited to come in.” “So there he is, that’s the 
one! He cheers so loudly that I can even make out his voice from my 
dressing room! How many times have you been handed over to the 
police for creating a disturbance in my honor?” “Twice.” “Only twice? 
Well, and why have you come?” “To see you.” “Fine. And now what?” 
“I don't know. Whatever you want.” “Well, I know what I want. My 
breakfast. You see, the table’s been set. Sit down and join me.” They 
made another place. She laughed at him and he laughed at himself. He 
was young, not bad-looking, not unintelligent, and very original. Why 
not have some fun with him? So she did, for two weeks or so, and then 
she said, “Clear out!” “I've been wanting to go, but I felt awkward.” 
“Then we part as friends?” They embraced once again. Splendid! But 
all of this occurred a long time ago—some three years back—and for 
the last two years he’s refrained from such pranks. 

In addition to his friends and two or three professors who'd recog- 
nized in him the makings of a good scientist, he met only the families 


94 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


of those young people he tutored. But he only “met” the families: he 
avoided any intimacy like the plague and treated all the members of 
the family coldly, except for his young pupils. 


iii. 


And so Lopukhov entered the room and saw the family, including 
Verochka, seated at tea; of course, the family, including Verochka, saw 
that the tutor had entered the room. 

“Please be seated,” said Marya Aleksevna. “Matryona, bring another 
glass.”27 

“If that’s for me, then thank you very much, but I don’t want any 
tea.” 

“Matryona, no need for that glass.” (What a well-mannered young 
man!) “Why don’t you want any? You should have a little something.” 

He looked at Marya Aleksevna. Then, as if by chance, he glanced at 
Verochka—or perhaps it wasn't really by chance? Perhaps he had 
noticed the slight shrug of her shoulders? “And he’s noticed that I 
blushed,” she thought. 

“Thank you, but I drink tea only at home.” 

“On the other hand, he’s not so shy. He entered and bowed with 
ease,” thought the young woman sitting at one end of the table. “On 
the other hand, if she’s a spoiled brat, at least she’s ashamed of her 
mother’s vulgarity,” thought the young man sitting at the other end of 
the table. 

Fedya soon finished his tea and went off to his lesson. Thus the 
most important result of the evening was only that Marya Aleksevna 
formed a favorable impression of the tutor, seeing that her sugarbowl 
would most likely suffer no major losses from the rescheduling of her 
son’s lessons from morning to evening. 

Two days later the tutor once again found the family at tea; again he 
refused a glass, thereby setting Marya Aleksevna’s mind completely at 
ease. This time there was a new face seated at the table—an officer, on 
whom Marya Aleksevna fawned. “Ah,” he thought, “the suitor!” 

The suitor, in accordance with his uniform and station in life, con- 
sidered it necessary not merely to notice the tutor but, having done so, 
to size him up from head to toe with a slow, offhand glance, as is 
customary in good society. He’d just begun this process when he felt 
that the tutor was not only doing the same thing to him but even 


27. In Russia women traditionally drank tea from a cup while men used a glass, 
sometimes in a metal holder. 


What Is to Be Done? 95 


worse: he was looking him straight in the eye, and so intently that, 
instead of continuing with his own inspection, the suitor said, “Is your 
field a difficult one, Monsieur Lopukhov? . . . | mean medicine.” 

“It is,” he replied, all the while looking him straight in the eye. 

The suitor noticed that his own left hand, for no good reason, was 
toying with the second and third buttons of his uniform. If things had 
gotten that bad, there was nothing left to do but drink up his glass of 
tea as quickly as possible in order to ask Marya Aleksevna for another. 
“If I'm not mistaken, you’re wearing the uniform of such-and-such a 
regiment?” asked the tutor. 

“Yes, I serve in that regiment,” replied Mikhail Ivanych. 

“Have you been in it for very long?” 

“Nine years.” 

“Did you enter it as soon as you began to serve?” 

“I did.” 

“Do you have your own company yet?” 

“No, not yet.” (Why, he’s interrogating me as if I were his orderly!) 

“Do you hope to get one soon?” 

“Not for a while.” 

“Hmm.” The tutor considered this sufficient and terminated the 
interrogation, once again staring his imaginary orderly straight in the 
eye. 

“On the other hand ... on the other hand .. .” thought Verochka, 
“but what is ‘the other hand’? At last I’ve discovered what it is. On the 
other hand, he behaves himself as Serge would, the man who accom- 
panied dear Julie that time. He’s no beast! But why does he say such 
strange things about young women, for example, that only stupid men 
love beautiful girls; besides, besides . . . what is ‘besides’? I’ve discov- 
ered what it is—besides, why didn't he want to hear anything about 
me? Why did he say it wouldn't be interesting?” 

“Verochka, would you play something for us on the piano? Mikhail 
Ivanych and I would be delighted to listen,” said Marya Aleksevna 
when Verochka had put her second cup of tea down on the table. 

“Why not?” 

“And if you'd sing us a song, Vera Pavlovna,” added Mikhail Ivanych 
in an ingratiating tone. 

“Why not?” 

“However,” thought the tutor, “that ‘Why not’ sounds awfully like 
‘I’m willing to do anything just to get rid of you.’” Although he'd been 
sitting there for five minutes or so and had never glanced at her, he 
knew that she hadn't looked at her suitor even once except when she 
answered his question. Even then she looked at him exactly the same 
way she looked at her mother and father, coldly and without affection. 


96 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Something wasn't quite right, just as Fedya had indicated. Then again, 
perhaps she really was a cold, proud young woman eager to enter 
high society—to hold sway and be dazzling. Perhaps she was dis- 
pleased that a better suitor for her couldn't have been found. She 
would accept his offer, despising him all the while, because there was 
no one else to lead her where she wanted to go. All this was becoming 
more interesting. 

“Fedya, drink up quickly,” said his mother. 

“Don’t hurry him, Marya Aleksevna, I would like to listen, if Vera 
Pavlovna will permit,” said the tutor. 

Verochka picked up the first songbook that came to hand, not even 
looking to see what it was, opened it to the first piece she came to, and 
began to play mechanically. It didn’t matter what or how she played, 
as long as she could be done with it as quickly as possible. But it 
happened to be an interesting piece, something out of a fairly decent 
opera, and the girl's playing became more animated. Upon finishing, 
she was about to rise. 

“But you promised to sing, Vera Pavlovna. If I may be so bold, I 
would like to hear something from Rigoletto.” (All that season “La 
donna é mobile” was a very popular aria.)2® 

“Very well.” Verochka sang “La donna é mobile,” stood up, and went 
to her room. 

“No, she isn’t a cold woman without a soul. This is very interesting,” 
thought the tutor. 

“Wasn't that nice?” said Mikhail Ivanych to the tutor in a normal 
tone, without sizing him up. “Why, there’s no need to have poor rela- 
tions with people who know how to interrogate orderlies,” he thought. 
“Why not speak to the tutor without pretensions, so as not to anger 
him?” 

“Yes, very nice.” 

“Do you know music very well?” 

“S0-so.” 

“Do you play?” 

“A little.” 

Marya Aleksevna, who was listening to this conversation, had a hap- 
py thought. 

“What instrument do you play, Dmitry Sergeich?” she inquired. 

“Piano.” 

“Could we possibly ask you to favor us with a selection?” 

“Gladly.” 


28. An opera by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901), first performed in 
St. Petersburg in 1853. Ironically, the aria in question, "Women Are Fickle,” is sung by 
one of the most fickle men in all of Italian opera.

He played a piece. He performed not brilliantly, but well enough, 
perhaps not at all badly. 

After he had finished the lesson, Marya Aleksevna went up to him 
and said they were having a little party the following evening, in honor 
of her daughter’s birthday, and she wondered if he would like to 
attend. 

Clearly there was a shortage of men, as is usual at such parties. 
Never mind, he'd get a closer look at this girl. There was something 
very interesting in her or about her. “Yes, thank you. I would.” But the 
tutor was mistaken. Marya Aleksevna had a much more important 
reason than providing dancing partners for the girls. 

Dear reader, you know, of course, well in advance that there will be a 
conversation between Verochka and Lopukhov which will clear up the 
misunderstanding between them and that they will fall in love. That 
goes without saying. 


iv. 


Marya Aleksevna wanted to hold a big party on the occasion of her 
daughter's birthday, but Verochka begged her not to invite any guests; 
the former hoped to exhibit the new suitor, while the latter found the 
whole process very painful. They came to an understanding and 
agreed to hold a small party and to ask only a few of their closest 
acquaintances. They invited some of Pavel Konstantinych’s colleagues 
(of course, those higher in rank and senior in position to him), two of 
Marya Aleksevna’s friends, and three young women who were Ver- 
ochka’s dearest companions. 

In surveying the assembled guests, Lopukhov noted that there was 
no shortage of men. Each young woman was paired with a young man, 
either a potential or an actual suitor. Consequently, Lopukhov had not 
been invited as a dancing partner. So what was it, then? After some 
thought, he recalled that his invitation had been preceded by his 
demonstration at the piano. So he'd been invited to reduce their ex- 
penses by eliminating the need to hire a pianist. “Very well,” he 
thought, “but I beg your pardon, Marya Aleksevna.” He went up to 
Pavel Konstantinych. 

“Well, Pavel Konstantinych, what do you think? Isn’t it about time to 
play some whist? Look, the old folks are getting bored.” 

“What stakes do you play?” 

“Any at all.” 

A hand was arranged at once and Lopukhov sat down to play. The 
Academy in the Vyborg district is a classical institution for playing 


98 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


cards. It’s not at all unusual to find in someone's room (that is, in the 
room of some registered student) a game that’s been going on for over 
a day and a half. It must be admitted that the sums of money that 
change hands at these card tables are considerably smaller than those 
at the English Club,?9 but the level of the players’ skill is much higher. 
Lopukhov himself was a devoted player at one time, that is, when he 
was at his most destitute. 

“Mesdames, how shall we play? We could take turns, but there are 
only seven of us left; we won't have enough ladies or gentlemen to 
make up a quadrille.” 

The first rubber was just ending when one of the girls, the boldest, 
ran up to Lopukhov. 

“Monsieur Lopukhov, you simply must dance.” 

“On one condition,” he replied, rising and bowing. 

“What's that?” 

“I invite you to dance the first quadrille.” 

“Oh, my heavens! I’m already engaged for the first, but I’m free for 
the second.” 

Lopukhov made another deep bow. Two gentlemen were taking 
turns playing. Lopukhov asked Verochka to dance the third quadrille; 
she was engaged to Mikhail Ivanych for the first, and he’d promised 
the second to the bold young woman. 

Lopukhov watched Verochka and was absolutely convinced of the 
error in his previous view of her as a girl without a soul, who, in a cold 
and calculating manner, was out to marry a man she despised. He 
now saw before him an ordinary young girl who danced and laughed 
from the depths of her soul. Yes, to Verochka’s shame it must be 
admitted that she was an ordinary young girl who loved to dance. She 
had insisted that there be no party, but once a small one had been 
arranged (excluding any exhibition of her suitor, that she would have 
found too burdensome), then, contrary to her own expectations, she 
forgot all about her grief. At that age one doesn't want to grieve; one 
wants to run, laugh, and make merry. The least opportunity compels 
one to forget one’s grief for a little while. Lopukhov'’s sympathies were 
now at her disposal; still, there was a great deal that he did not yet 
understand. 

He was intrigued by Verochka’s strange predicament. 

“Monsieur Lopukhov, I never expected to see you dancing,” she 
began. 


29. Founded in 1770 by the British manufacturer Francis Gardner, the English Club 
was the oldest and most fashionable social establishment in prerevolutionary Russia. Its 
membership included many of the most prominent political, literary, and social figures 
of their day.

“Why not? Is it all that hard to dance?” 

“Of course it isn’t, in general; but for you, of course it is.” 

“Why is it so for me?” 

“Because I know your secret—yours and Fedya’s. You hold women 
in contempt.” 

“Fedya didn’t quite understand my secret: I don’t hold women in 
contempt, but I do avoid them. Do you know why? I have a fiancée 
who is so jealous that she told me their secret to make me avoid 
them.” 

“You have a fiancée?” 

“Yes.” 

“What a surprise! A student, yet already betrothed! Is she very pret- 
ty? Are you in love with her?” 

“Yes, she is a great beauty and I love her very much.” 

“Is she blonde or brunette?” 

“I can’t answer that. It’s a secret.” 

“Well, good luck to her if that’s a secret. But what secret did she 
reveal to you which would make you avoid the society of women?” 

“Knowing that I don’t like being in a bad mood, she conveyed such a 
secret to me that I can no longer look at any woman without getting 
into a bad mood. Therefore I avoid women.” 

“You can’t look at any woman without getting into a bad mood? 
You're quite expert at paying compliments!” 

“How can I say it any other way? To pity means to be in a bad 
mood.” 

“Are we really so pitiful?” 

“Aren’t you a woman? All I have to do is tell you your most intimate 
desire and you'll agree with me. It's a desire shared by all women.” 

“Tell me, please.” 

“It is ‘Oh, how I'd like to be a man! I have yet to meet any woman in 
whom I couldn't discover this most intimate desire. In the vast major- 
ity there's no need to search for it; it expresses itself directly, with no 
summons necessary, as soon as the woman's the least bit upset. Then 
you'll immediately hear something of this sort: ‘We women are such 
poor creatures!’ or ‘Being a man isn't at all like being a woman! or even 
the exact words, ‘Why wasn’t I born a man!” 

Verochka smiled. It was true: these words could indeed be heard 
from any woman. 

“So you see how pitiful women are. If the most intimate desire of 
each and every one were to be fulfilled, there would be no women at 
all left on earth.” 

“Yes, that seems to be so,” said Verochka. 

“In precisely the same way that if the most intimate desire of every 


100 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


poor person were to be fulfilled, there would be none of them left on 
the earth. So, you see, how can one say that women are not pitiful? 
They are just as pitiful as the poor. Who enjoys seeing poor people? 
I’ve found it just as disagreeable to look at women since I discovered 
their secret. It was revealed to me by my jealous fiancée on the day of 
our betrothal. Up to that time I very much enjoyed being in the com- 
pany of women; since then, my enjoyment has vanished, as if by 
magic. My fiancée cured me.” 

“Your fiancée is a kind and clever woman. Yes, we women are poor, 
pitiful creatures!” said Verochka. “But who is your fiancée? You speak 
about her so mysteriously.” 

“That’s my secret, which even Fedya won't tell you. I share the 
desire of the poor completely, that poverty may cease; someday that 
desire will be fulfilled. Sooner or later we'll be able to organize life in 
such a way that there'll be no more poverty. But .. .” 

“No more poverty,” interrupted Verochka. “I've always thought that 
would happen, but I’ve never been able to figure out how. Tell me.” 

“I can’t, but my fiancée could. Without her I can only say that she’s 
working on it; she’s very strong, stronger than anyone else on earth. 
We weren't talking about her, but about women. I share the desire of 
the poor completely, that poverty should cease, because my fiancée 
will accomplish that. But I’m not in agreement with women’s desire 
that there be no more women left on earth, because that desire can't 
possibly be fulfilled. I can’t agree with what can’t be. But I have an- 
other desire. I would like it if women would become friends with my 
fiancée. She'll work on their behalf, as she does for so many, for every- 
one. If they became friends with her, I would no longer have any 
reason to pity them, and their most intimate desire—‘Oh, why wasn't I 
born a man!—would soon disappear. If women got to know her well, 
they'd fare no worse than men.” 

“Monsieur Lopukhov! Let's dance another quadrille! Without fail!” 

“I commend you for that,” he said shaking her hand in a serene and 
serious manner, as if he were her girlfriend or she his comrade. 
“Which one?” 

“The last.” 

“Very well.” 

Marya Aleksevna brushed past them several times during that quad- 
rille. 

What would she have thought of their conversation if she’d over- 
heard it? We, who heard the whole thing from beginning to end, 
maintain that it was a very strange conversation indeed to have while 
dancing a quadrille. 


What Is to Be Done? 101 


Now it was time for the last one. 

“We were talking only about me,” began Lopukhov. “It wasn't very 
polite of me to talk only about myself. Now I would like to be more 
polite and talk about you, Vera Pavlovna. You know that I had a much 
worse opinion of you than you had of me. But now. . . well, we'll come 
back to that later. There's still one thing I can’t figure out. Please 
explain it to me. How soon is your wedding?” 

“Never.” 

“Just as I supposed during the last three hours since I left the card 
table to come over here. Then why is he considered to be your suitor?” 

“Why is he considered to be my suitor? Why indeed? Part of it is too 
painful to tell. The other part I can explain: I pity him. He loves me so 
much. You'll say that I should tell him directly what I think about our 
marriage. I have. He says, ‘Don’t say that. It will destroy me. Keep 
silent.” 

“That's the second reason. As for the first, the one you can't tell me, I 
can tell you: your family situation is horrible.” 

“It’s tolerable now. No one torments me at the moment. Theyre all 
waiting, and they leave me alone, or almost alone.” 

“But that can’t go on forvery long. They’ll begin to pester you again. 
What will you do then?” 

“Nothing. I've thought about it and have decided. I won't remain 
here any longer. I can become an actress. What an enviable life! Inde- 
pendence! Independence!” 

“And applause.” 

“Yes, that’s nice too. But the main thing is independence! To do 
what I want, to live as I want, without asking anyone, without demand- 
ing anything from anyone, without needing anyone at all. That’s the 
way I want to live!” 

“Fine. Splendid! Now I have a favor: I could find out how it’s done, 
whom to turn to. All right?” 

“Thank you.” Verochka shook his hand. “Do it at once: I want to 
escape as soon as possible from my vile, intolerable, humiliating posi- 
tion. I say, ‘I’m calm and can bear it,’ but is it really true? Can't I see 
what's happening to my reputation? Don’t I know what everyone here 
thinks of me? She’s a conniver and a schemer; she wants to be rich, to 
enter high society, to be dazzling; she'll keep her husband under her 
thumb, twist him around her finger, deceive him. Don’t I know what 
they all think of me? I don’t want to live like this! I don’t!” She suddenly 
became pensive. “Don't laugh at what I say, but I do pity him. He loves 
me so much.” 

“He loves you? Does he look at you the way I do or not? Does he?” 


102 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“You look at me in a simple, direct manner. No, your look doesn’t 
offend me.” 

“You see, Vera Pavlovna, that’s because . . . Never mind. But does he 
look at you the same way?” 

Verochka blushed and remained silent. 

“Then he doesn't love you. That's not love, Vera Pavlovna.” 

“But .. .” Verochka didn't finish. 

“You wanted to say, ‘Well, if it’s not love, what is it?’ Never mind for 
now. But you yourself must admit that it’s not love. Whom do you love 
most of all? I’m not talking about that kind of love. I mean among your 
friends and relatives.” 

“No one in particular, I’m afraid. I don’t love any of them very much. 
But wait: I recently met a very strange woman. She told me all sorts of 
terrible things about herself and forbade me to be on friendly terms 
with her. We met under extraordinary circumstances. She said that if I 
were ever really desperate, if it were really a matter of life or death, 
then I could turn to her. But under no other circumstances. I love her 
very much.” 

“Would you want her to do something for you which she might find 
unpleasant or harmful?” 

Verocka smiled. “How could that be?” 

“Well, just imagine that you really wanted her to do something for 
you, and she said, ‘If I do this, it will torment me.’ Would you repeat 
your request? Would you insist on it?” 

“I would sooner die.” 

“There. You said it yourself. Now that’s love. But that love is simple 
affection, not passion. But what is love as passion? How is passion 
different from simple affection? In intensity. Thus, if love as simple 
affection in its weakest form (too weak when compared to passion) 
places you in such a relation to another person that you say, ‘It’s better 
to die than cause that person pain,’ if simple affection says that, what 
will passion say, since it's a thousand times more intense? It will say: 
‘I'd sooner die, than ... demand? ask? No, than even permit that 
person to do anything for me except what he himself would find 
pleasant. I'd sooner die than have him feel pressured or force himself.’ 
Love is the kind of passion that would say that. If it isn’t, then it’s pure 
passion, and not love at all. I'll leave you now. I've said all that I have to 
say, Vera Pavlovna.” 

Verochka shook his hand. 

“Good-bye. Why don’t you congratulate me? Today is my birthday.” 

Lopukhov looked at her. 

“It may just be. It may. If you’re not mistaken, then it may be good 
for me, too.” 


What Is to Be Done? 103 


Vv. 


“How sudden, how unexpected,” mused Verochka, alone in her 
room at the end of the evening. “It’s the first time we've spoken to- 
gether, and yet we've become so close. A half hour before we didn't 
know each other at all; an hour later we've become very close. How 
strange!” 

No, it isn’t strange at all, Verochka. People such as Lopukhov possess 
magic words that attract any aggrieved, offended creature. It’s their 
fiancée who provides them with these words. But what's really 
strange, Verochka—though neither to you nor to me—is that you're so 
calm about it. Love is considered to be a disquieting emotion. But 
you'll fall asleep tonight like a baby, and your sleep won't be troubled 
or disturbed by dreams, unless you dream of happy children’s games, 
forfeits or catch, perhaps of dancing, also happy and carefree. This 
may appear strange to others, but you don’t know that it’s strange, 
while I know that it’s not. Anxiety in love isn’t real love; if there’s any 
anxiety, then something isn’t as it should be, for love itself is happy 
and carefree. 

“How strange,” thinks Verochka. “I myself had pondered and antici- 
pated all that he said about the poor, about women, and about love. 
Where did I get it from? Was it from the books I read? No, it’s not the 
same: books contain hesitations and reservations. It’s all so extraordi- 
nary and improbable, like a wonderful dream, only it won't come true. 
But to me it always seemed so simple, simpler than anything else, the 
most ordinary thing, impossible to be without, sure that it would be, 
the surest of all! I considered these books the very best there were. 
Take George Sand,*° for instance—she’s so kind and upstanding, but 
in her books it’s all only dreams. What about our own writers? No, they 
have nothing of this sort at all! Or take Dickens.4! He has it, but he 
doesn't really expect it to happen; he merely desires it because he 
himself is so kind, but he knows that it can never be. Why don’t they 
know that this is impossible to do without, that this really must be 
accomplished, that it certainly will be—so that no one will ever be 
poor or unhappy again? Isn't this what they're all saying? No, they feel 
sorry, but they really think things will always stay just the way they 


30. Chernyshevsky greatly admired the French author George Sand (pseudonym of 
Amandine Dupin, baronne Dudevant; 1804-1876) for her feminist critique of marriage 
and of the unequal treatment accorded by society to women. Sand's novel Jacques (1834) 
clearly served as both inspiration and model for Chernyshevsky in What Is to Be Done? 
(On this influence, see Introduction, pp. 23-24.) 

31. Chernyshevsky greatly admired the English novelist Charles Dickens (1812-1870) 
for his stark, critical portrayal of the social effects of industrialization on England, 
particularly in such novels as Hard Times (1854). See also Introduction, pp. 24-25. 


104 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


are—maybe a little better, but still much the same. They didn't say 
what I've been thinking. If they had, I would have known that good, 
intelligent people think like that. It always seemed to me that I was all 
alone, the only one who thought like that, because I'm so foolish. 
Besides me, no one thinks like that and no one else is really waiting. 
But now here he is, saying that his fiancée has explained to all those 
who love her that everything will come to pass, just as it seemed to me. 
And she explained it all so clearly that everyone began to work to bring 
it about sooner. What a clever fiancée! But who is she? I'll find out, I 
really will. Yes, it'll be wonderful when there are no more poor people, 
when no one can coerce anyone else, when everyone is cheerful, good, 
and happy. .. .” 

And with that, Verochka fell fast asleep; she slept soundly, with no 
dreams. 

No, Verochka, it isn’t strange that you've pondered all this and have 
taken it to heart, you simple girl, you who've never even heard the 
names of those who've begun to teach this way and who've proven 
that this must come to pass, that it certainly will, that it can’t help but 
be. It isn't strange that you understood and took to heart those ideas 
that your books couldn't present clearly to you. Your books were writ- 
ten by people who studied these ideas when they were still just ideas; 
they seemed astonishing and exhilarating, but nothing more. Now, 
Verochka, these ideas are apparent in life; more books have been writ- 
ten by other people who consider these ideas splendid, but containing 
nothing astonishing. Verochka, these ideas are now part of the air we 
breathe, like the scent of fields when flowers are in bloom. These ideas 
penetrate everywhere; you heard them even from your drunken moth- 
er, who told you that life must be lived while explaining why she’d 
resorted to deceit and theft. She wanted to speak against your ideas, 
but she herself was developing them. You heard them from the impu- 
dent, corrupt Frenchwoman who drags her lover around behind her 
as if he were her maid; she does with him as she chooses. Neverthe- 
less, upon returning to her senses, she sees that she has no freedom 
herself. She must please others and constrain herself—and it’s all very 
painful. Already she seems to be doubting her own life with Serge, that 
good, gentle, kind man—and she says, all the same, “Even a person as 
bad as I am considers such relations to be sordid.” Nowadays, Ver- 
ochka, it isn't hard to acquire ideas such as yours. But others don't 
take them to heart. You do, and that’s admirable, but even that's 
strange. What's strange in your wanting to be a free and happy per- 
son? That desire is neither a very puzzling discovery of science nor a 
great feat of heroism. 

What's really strange, Verochka, is that there are people who don't 


What Is to Be Done? 105 


share this desire, who have completely different ones; perhaps it’s 
they who will find those ideas strange, my friend, with which you can 
fall asleep the first night of your being in love, that from thinking about 
yourself, your beloved, and your love, you should begin to think that 
all people should be happy and that one must work to bring this about 
soon. But, while you don’t know how strange it is, I know that it isn’t 
strange at all, that it alone is natural and humane. It’s simply humane: 
“I feel joy and happiness” means “I want everyone to be joyful and 
happy.” It’s humane, Verochka, that both of these ideas are one and 
the same. You're a good girl; you're not foolish. Forgive me for saying it, 
but I find nothing astonishing about you. Perhaps half the young 
women I've known, perhaps more than half (I haven’t counted—there 
are far too many), are no worse than you; and some of them, forgive me 
for saying so, are even better. 

Lopukhov thinks you’re a wonderful girl, no doubt about it; but it’s 
not surprising that he should think so, since he’s in love with you. And 
there’s nothing astonishing about the fact that he’s in love with you. 
You're quite lovable. Since he’s in love, he must think about you in just 
that way. 


Vi. 


Marya Aleksevna brushed past her daughter and the tutor during 
the first quadrille, but during the second she did not appear near 
them, so engrossed was she in preparing some hors d’oeuvres in lieu 
of supper. Having finished with these labors, she inquired after the 
tutor, but he’d already gone. 

Two days later he arrived for his lesson. The samovar was brought 
in, as was always the case at that time. Marya Aleksevna came into the 
room where the tutor gave Fedya his lessons. Matryona usually sum- 
moned Fedya to tea; since the tutor didn’t take tea, he wanted to 
remain in the classroom and use the time to read through Fedya’s 
notebook. But Marya Aleksevna invited him in to sit with her, as she 
wanted to have a talk with him. He came in and sat down at the table. 

Marya Aleksevna began by interrogating him about Fedya’s abilities, 
which gymnasium was better, and whether it might not be better to 
enroll the lad as a live-in student. The questions were natural enough, 
but weren't they being raised a bit prematurely? During this conversa- 
tion she so earnestly and cordially urged the tutor to have some tea 
that he agreed to deviate from his own rule and accept a glass. 
Verochka came in after some time; she and the tutor exchanged bows, 
as if nothing had taken place between them, and Marya Aleksevna 


106 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


continued to talk about Fedya. Then the conversation took a sudden, 
precipitous turn when she began to inquire about the tutor himself. 
Who was he, what was he, who were his parents, were they people of 
means, how did he live, and what were his plans for the future? The 
tutor gave adequate answers, but remained rather vague. He had a 
family, they lived in the provinces, they were not wealthy, he sup- 
ported himself by giving lessons, and he planned to become a doctor 
in Petersburg. In a word, nothing much came of the inquiry. Confront- 
ing such obstinacy, Marya Aleksevna got to the point in a more direct 
manner: 

“So you say that you'll become a doctor here. Well, thank God— 
Petersburg doctors can earn a living. What about a family? Do you have 
your eye on a nice girl?” 

What’s all this? The tutor had almost forgotten about his fantastic 
fiancée and was just about to say, “No, I don't,” when he suddenly 
thought, “Ah, so she overheard our conversation!” He was very 
amused: what an absurd story he’d thought up then! Why did I devise 
such an allegory—it wasn’t needed at all? And now just look! They 
say that propaganda is harmful: look at the effect it’s had on a woman 
whose heart is pure and who is not disposed to do evil. Well, so she 
overheard and understood. What of it? 

“Yes, indeed I do,” said Lopukhov. 

“Are you engaged?” 

“Tam.” 

“Formally or just an understanding between the two of you?” 

“Formally.” 

Poor Marva Aleksevna! She had overheard the words “my fiancée,” 
“your fiancée,” “I love her very much,” “she is very beautiful,” and she 
had been reassured that the tutor had no designs on her daughter. By 
the second quadrille she could devote herself entirely to preparing 
some hors d'oeuvres in lieu of supper. But now she wanted to hear 
this reassuring story in greater detail and with more substance. She 
continued her questions; everyone enjoys hearing reassuring conver- 
sations. In any Case, it was curious, everything was curious. The tutor 
provided more substance, although he preferred to keep his answers 
brief. Was his fiancée attractive? Extraordinarily so. Was there a dow- 
ry? No, but she would inherit a fortune. How large? Very. Enormous? 
Indeed. Over 100,000 rubles? Much more. How much? Why talk about 
it? Suffice it to say that it was very large. In cash? Yes, that too. Proper- 
ty, perhaps? That too. How soon? Very. And when will the wedding be? 


no

mation of society which can be achieved through the knowledge gained from scientific 
study.

Soon. As it should be, Dmitry Sergeich, and before she comes into her 
inheritance, because afterward there'll be no getting rid of suitors. 
Absolutely true. And how was it that God had sent him such good 
fortune and that no one else had snatched her away? Just so. Almost 
no one else knows that she’s to inherit a fortune. But he had found out 
about it? Yes. How? He had to confess that he'd been inquiring for 
some time before he discovered it. Was he sure that it was true? 
Indeed, he’d checked all the documents himself. Himself? Yes. Right 
away. Right away? Of course. Who in his right mind would take one 
step without checking? Precisely, Dmitry Sergeich, not one step. What 
good fortune! Surely the answer to his parents’ prayers! No doubt. 

Marya Aleksevna had taken a liking to the tutor from the moment 
she found out that he didn’t drink tea; clearly he was a sound and 
solid man. He said little, but that was all to the good—he was no 
chatterbox. And what he said, he said well, especially concerning 
money. But as of the other evening she realized that the tutor was an 
excellent find, mainly as a result of his refusal to flirt with young ladies 
in any family where he was employed. Such an absolute prohibition is 
rare among our young people. By now she was completely satisfied 
with him. He was a very solid man indeed! Why, he’d never even 
bragged about having a rich fiancée. She'd had to pry each and every 
word out of him. And how he’d managed to sniff out the fortune. 
Obviously he’d been searching for a wealthy fiancée for some time— 
and just look how he'd managed to insinuate himself into her graces! 
Well, he certainly knows how to conduct his own affairs. He checked 
the documents himself, right away, he says. Who in his right mind, he 
says, would take one step . . . ? He’s a young man of unusual solidity. 

At first Verochka could hardly refrain from smiling too noticeably, 
but gradually it occurred to her (How did it? No, it couldn't be! Yes, it 
could ...) that while Lopukhov was answering Marya Aleksevna’s 
questions, he wasn't talking to her at all, but to Verochka. He was 
playing a trick on Marya Aleksevna and was in all earnestness telling 
only her, Verochka, the whole truth and nothing but. 

Was she just imagining this or was it really so? Who knows? He did, 
and she would soon. As for us, chances are there’s no need for us to 
know: we only need the facts. And the fact was that at first Verochka 
smiled while listening to Lopukhov, then realized that in all earnest- 
ness he was speaking to her, not to Marya Aleksevna, and that he was 
not joking, but telling the truth. Marya Aleksevna, who had listened 
very intently to Lopukhov right from the beginning, turned to Ver- 
ochka and said, “Verochka, my dear, why are you sitting there like an 
oaf? By now youre well enough acquainted with Dmitry Sergeich. You 
should ask him to accompany you on the piano while you sing some- 


108 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


thing!” What she really meant was “We have great respect for you, 
Dmitry Sergeich, and would like for you to become a close friend of 
our family. And you, Verochka, should not be shy with Dmitry Ser- 
gevich. I'll tell Mikhail Ivanych that he already has a fiancée, and he 
won't be jealous.” That was the meaning of her words for Verochka 
and for Dmitry Sergeich—he was now no longer the “tutor” in Marya 
Aleksevna’s mind, but “Dmitry Sergeich.” As for Marya Aleksevna her- 
self, these words had yet a third, very natural and genuine meaning: 
We must flatter him. When he’s rich, that rascal’s friendship may 
eventually come in handy. That was the gist of Marya Aleksevna’'s 
words as far as she herself was concerned. But in addition, there was 
also a private meaning: After I've flattered him, I'll tell him how modest 
our means are and how difficult it is for us to pay one ruble per lesson. 
Marya Aleksevna's words contained all these meanings! Dmitry Ser- 
geich said that he would finish the lesson first, and then he'd be glad 
to play something on the piano. 


vii. 


Marya Aleksevna’s words had many meanings, and no fewer results. 
Concerning their most private meaning, that is, a reduction in the cost 
of the lessons, she was more successful than she’d hoped to be. Two 
lessons later, when she once again raised the issue of their modest 
means, Dmitry Sergeich began to bargain, and bargain he did; for a 
long time he didn’t give in, but held out for 75 kopecks (you recall that 
at the time there were still coins worth 75 kopecks). Marya Aleksevna 
never thought that he would go any lower, but contrary to all her 
expectations, she managed to knock the price down to 60 kopecks. It 
would seem that the private meaning of her words—the hope of re- 
ducing the price—contradicted her own opinion of Dmitry Sergeich 
(not Lopukhov, but Dmitry Sergeich) as a greedy scoundrel. Why 
should such a money-grubber conduct his financial affairs with any 
regard for their need? And if he did so, then she ought to have been 
disappointed to find him so frivolous, and consequently so harmful an 
influence. Of course, she would have reached that very conclusion had 
it concerned anyone else's business. But human nature is such that 
it’s difficult to judge one’s own affairs according to any general rule. 
People love to make exceptions in their own favor. When Collegiate 
Secretary Ivanov assures Collegiate Councillor Ivan Ivanych that he’s 
devoted to him heart and soul, Ivan Ivanych knows full well that he 
can’t expect such devotion from anyone. Moreover, he knows that 
Ivanov in particular has sold his own father for a decent price at least 


What Is to Be Done? 109 


five times before, thereby outdoing Ivan Ivanych himself, who’s sold 
his father only three times. Nevertheless, Ivan Ivanych believes that 
Ivanov is devoted to him; that is, he doesn’t really believe it, but is 
favorably disposed toward him, and even if he doesn't believe it, he 
allows him to make a fool of him—all of which indicates that he 
believes him anyway, even though he really doesn’t. What would you 
have us do with this characteristic of the human heart? It’s bad, even 
harmful. Unfortunately, Marya Aleksevna wasn't exempt from this fail- 
ing shared by almost all money-grubbers, schemers, and good-for- 
nothings. Exceptions to the rule can be found only in two extreme 
cases of moral worth: either the man is a transcendental scoundrel, an 
eighth wonder of the world as regards knavish virtuosity on the order 
of Ali Pasha Yaninsky of Albania, Ahmed Djezzar of Syria, or Mehemet 
Ali of Egypt, who hoodwinked European diplomats as if they were 
babes-in-arms (as Djezzar did Napoleon the Great), at a time when 
swindling enveloped every living soul like an absolutely impenetrable 
coat of armor.%3 It was virtually impossible to break through it to any 
human weakness: pride, ambition, lust for power, self-love—nothing. 
But there are extremely few heroes of such swindles, and they can 
rarely be found on European soil, where the virtuosity of deception 
suffers from many human frailties. Therefore, if someone points to a 
swindler and says, “No one will ever succeed in duping that man,” you 
may boldly wager ten rubles to one, even though you may not be as 
cunning, that you will hoodwink him, if only you want to. And you 
may boldly wager a hundred rubles to one that he’s prone to deluding 
himself one way or another, since the most common, general charac- 
teristic of all swindlers is that they delude themselves in some way. 
Louis Philippe and Metternich seemed to be real experts, but look how 
beautifully both managed to ride their own delusions from Paris and 
Vienna all the way to lush locales and bucolic backwaters where they 
could enjoy the sight of some local yokel herding sheep.34 While Napo- 


33. Chernyshevsky is satirizing idealistic philosophy by suggesting that some scoun- 
drels manage to transcend normal limits of human experience in their roguery. Nomi- 
nally governor of the Ottoman province that contained Albania, Ali Pasha Yaninsky 
(1744?-1822) ruled the area as a quasi-independent despot until he was assassinated for 
resisting the Turks’ attempts to unseat him. Ahmed Djezzar (1735-1804) was a Middle 
Eastern political adventurer who halted Napoleon's advance into Syria at Acre in 1799. 
Mehemet Ali (1769-1849), an Albanian tobacco merchant who entered Turkish service, 
helped to preserve Ottoman suzerainty in Egypt in 1799, forced the sultan to appoint 
him governor there in 1805, schemed with the French to expand his power, and ul- 
timately founded the dynasty that ruled in Egypt until 1952. 

34. Sometimes known as the “bourgeois king,” Louis Philippe adopted the dress, 
manners, and political attitudes of the bourgeoisie, on whose support he relied after 
coming to power in France in 1830. At the outbreak of unrest in Paris in February 1848, 
he fled to England, where he died two years later (see also nn. 24 above and 41 below). As 


110 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


leon was so clever—much cleverer than the two of them put together 
(in addition, he was said to possess a brilliant intellect)—but he delud- 
ed himself and landed on Elba. And, as if that wasn’t enough, he went 
even further and succeeded so well that he deluded himself all the 
way to St. Helena.*5 It was so very difficult, almost impossible, yet he 
managed to overcome all obstacles en route to that island. Just read 
Charras’s History of the Campaign of 1815;36 it poignantly portrays the 
zeal and skill with which he deluded himself. Alas, even Marya Alek- 
sevna wasn’t exempt from this harmful proclivity. 

There are very few people whose consummate skill in deceiving 
others can serve as a suit of armor against self-delusion. On the other 
hand, there are lots of people whose simple purity of heart serves 
them admirably in this respect. According to the testimony of all the 
Vidocqs and Vanka-Cains of the world, there’s no task more difficult 
than duping a sincere, honest man if he has the least bit of intelligence 
and life experiences” Reasonably intelligent individuals are never 
hoodwinked individually. But they possess another, equally harmful 
form of this human frailty: they are subject to mass delusion. A swin- 
dler will never be able to lead a single individual by the nose; but as for 
a large group taken together, their noses are always ready and willing! 
Meanwhile, the swindlers, weak as individuals and each led by his 
own nose, when taken together can never be led by their noses. That’s 
the whole secret of world history. 

But there’s really no need to delve into world history here. We're 
telling a tale, so let’s get on with it. 

The first result of Marya Aleksevna’s words was a reduction in the 
price of the tutor’s lessons. The second, as a direct consequence of the 
first, was that Marya Aleksevna became even more convinced of the tu- 
tor's (ie., no longer the tutor’s, but Dmitry Sergeich’s) absolute re- 
liability. She even came to the conclusion that conversations with him 


Austrian foreign minister from 1809 and chancellor from 1821, Prince Klemens Metter- 
nich (1773-1859) acquired the reputation of a schemer and a reactionary through skillful 
diplomatic maneuvering designed to preserve the traditional monarchical and aristo- 
cratic order in post-Napoleonic Europe. Having lost power during the revolutions of 
1848, he also fled briefly to Britain before returning to live in retirement in Austria.

more distant St. Helena, where he died in 1821.

came a police agent in Moscow before returning to his original calling, for which he was 
exiled to Siberia in 1755.

would be useful for Verochka and might make her more inclined to 
marry Mikhail Ivanych. This conclusion was very brilliant indeed, and 
Marya Aleksevna would never have arrived at it on her own, had she 
not encountered clear, incontrovertible proof of Dmitry Sergeich’s 
beneficial influence on Verochka. We shall now see how she acquired 
this proof. 

The third result of Marya Aleksevna’s words was, naturally, that 
Verochka and Dmitry Sergeich began to spend a considerable amount 
of time together, with the mother's permission and encouragement. 
After finishing his lessons around eight o'clock, Lopukhov would re- 
main at the Rozalsky house for another two or three hours. He'd play a 
game of cards with the lady of the house, the man of the house, and 
the suitor; he'd chat with them; he'd play the piano while Verochka 
sang, or she'd play while he listened; sometimes he'd talk with Ver- 
ochka—Marya Aleksevna wouldn't object or interfere, although, of 
course, she’d never leave them alone without supervision. 

Oh, no, it goes without saying, she never left them alone; even 
though Dmitry Sergeich was a very fine young man, the old saying still 
rings true: Don't hide things carelessly and you won't lead a thief into 
temptation. She had no hesitation whatever in considering Dmitry 
Sergeich a thief—not in any critical way, but in a commendable one. 
Or else why should she respect him and want to make him a close 
acquaintance? One doesn't want to associate with fools, does one? Of 
course one should associate with fools when there's something to be 
gained by it. But so far Dmitry Sergeich had nothing of his own; there- 
fore, one could cultivate his friendship only for his virtues, that is, for 
his intelligence, reliability, prudence, and ability to manage his own 
affairs. And if every person has the devil knows what in mind, then all 
the more need to beware of such a clever man. Consequently, one 
would have to watch him very carefully. Marya Aleksevna did just that. 
But all of her observations only confirmed Dmitry Sergeich’s reliability 
and trustworthiness. 

How, for example, could one have detected the presence of amorous 
intrigues? By his peeking down her corset. Well, when Verochka plays 
the piano and Dmitry Sergeich stands right next to her listening, Mar- 
ya Aleksevna watches to see whether he will peek down her corset. No, 
not even close! Sometimes he doesn't even look at Verochka, but else- 
where, wherever his gaze leads; or else he does look at her, straight in 
the eye, so simply and coolly that it’s immediately clear he’s doing so 
only out of politeness, while he himself is thinking about his fiancée’s 
dowry. His eyes are never on fire as Mikhail Ivanych’s are. How else 
might amorous activities be recognized? By words of love. But no such 
words are heard. In fact, they hardly speak to each other. He talks 


112 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


more with Marya Aleksevna. Or else he started bringing books to Vera 
Pavlovna. 

Once when Verochka had gone to visit a friend, Mikhail Ivanych was 
paying a call on Marya Aleksevna. Marya Aleksevna picked up some of 
these books and brought them in to show him. 

“Have a look, Mikhail Ivanych. I've almost figured out the title of this 
French book all by myself: Gostinaya,** that must mean it’s a manual 
on social etiquette, but I can’t make out the German one.” 

“No, Marya Aleksevna, it’s not Gostinaya, it's Destinée;?° that means 
destiny.” 

“What kind of destiny? Is that the title of a novel, a fortune-telling 
guide, or a book on dream interpretation?” 

“Well, Marya Aleksevna, let's have a look and find out.” Mikhail Ivan- 
ych flipped through a few pages. “Most of it deals with series, Marya 
Aleksevna.*° It’s a scholarly book.” 

“Series? That’s good—that means how to conduct monetary trans- 
actions.” 

“Yes, that's what it’s all about, Marya Aleksevna.” 

“Well, and what about the German book?” 

Mikhail Ivanych read the title slowly: “On Religion, by Ludwig, that 
is, by Louis XIV, Marya Aleksevna. It’s a book by Louis XIV. He was king 
of France, Marya Aleksevna, the father of the king whose place is now 
occupied by Napoleon.”4! 

“That means it’s a book on religious matters?” 


38. Gostinaya: drawing room. See n. 39 below. 

39. Trying to pronounce the French title as if it were Russian, Marya Aleksevna 
confuses the French word destinée with the Russian gostinaya. The book in question is 
Destinée sociale (1834-1838), a socialist treatise written by Victor Considérant (1808— 
1893), a disciple of the French utopian socialist Charles Fourier (1772-1837). On Con- 
sidérant, see also nn. 40 and 94 below. 

40. Marya Aleksevna and Mikhail Ivanych are confusing the financial term “series” (in 
Russian, seriya) with Considérant's use of the term to denote a form of cooperatively or- 
ganized labor. 

41. Mikhail Ivanych is confusing the German left-Hegelian and materialist philoso- 
pher Ludwig Feuerbach (1804-1872) with the French king Louis XIV. Feuerbach argued 
in his two most influential treatises, The Essence of Christianity (1841) and Lectures on 
the Essence of Religion (1851), that God and other religious images derive from the 
projection of idealized human characteristics onto personified deities as a result of 
ignorance and fear. While thus demystifying and anthropologizing God, Feuerbach also 
deified man. In his Lectures Feverbach claimed that egoism was an inherent human 
trait that would not disappear with the overthrow of religion. 

Mikhail Ivanych is also revealing his ignorance of French history by asserting that 
Louis XIV (1613-1715; king of France, 1643-1715) was the father of Louis Philippe (1773— 
1850; king of the French, 1830-1848), who was overthrown in 1848 and succeeded by 
Napoleon III (1808-1873; emperor of the French, 1852-1870). In fact, Louis Philippe's 
father was Philippe Egalité (1747-1793), duc d'Orléans, head of the rival Orléanist branch 
of the Bourbon family, who was guillotined in 1793. 


What Is to Be Done? 113 


“Yes indeed, Marya Aleksevna.” 

“That's good, Mikhail Ivanych. Although I know that Dmitry Ser- 
gevich is a respectable young man, nevertheless you have to keep your 
eye on each and every young man.” 

“Of course, that's not what he has in mind, Marya Aleksevna; but all 
the same, I'm very grateful to you for your vigilance.” 

“One must be vigilant, Mikhail Ivanych; a mother's obligation is to 
protect her daughter's purity. I can vouch for Verochka’s. But here's 
what I’m wondering, Mikhail Ivanych: what religion was the king of 
France?” 

“Catholic, naturally.” 

“And in his book, is he trying to convert others to the papist reli- 
gion?’ 

“I think not, Marya Aleksevna. If a Catholic archbishop had written 
it, then undoubtedly he'd be trying to convert others to the papist 
religion. But a king wouldn't concern himself with such matters. As a 
wise ruler and politician, he simply wishes to instill piety.” 

Well, what more is to be said? Marya Aleksevna couldn't help but see 
that Mikhail Ivanych, in spite of his limited intelligence, was very 
sound in his reasoning. Nevertheless, she wished to clarify matters 
once and for all. Two or three days later she said to Lopukhov, while 
playing a game of preference with him and Mikhail Ivanych: “Say, 
Dmitry Sergeich, I want to ask you something. Did the father of the 
preceding king of France, the one whose place is now occupied by 
Napoleon, did he order baptism in the papist religion?”44 

“No, Marya Aleksevna, he did not.” 

“And is the papist religion a good thing, Dmitry Sergeich?” 

“No, Marya Aleksevna, it is not. I play the seven of diamonds.” 

“I only asked out of curiosity, Dmitry Sergeich. Although I'm not an 
educated woman, I thought it would be interesting to know. How 
many did you fail to write off, Dmitry Sergeich?” 

“None, Mary Aleksevna. They train us well at the Academy. A doctor 
has to know how to play cards.” 

For Lopukhov these questions remained a complete mystery. Why 
did Marya Aleksevna need to know whether Philippe Egalité had or- 
dered baptism in the papist religion? 

After all this, wouldn't it have been excusable if Marya Aleksevna had 
stopped exhausting herself as a result of this unceasing vigilance? He 
doesn't peek down the girl's corset, his face shows no particular emo- 
tion, and he lends her religious books. What more could one ask for? 


42. Marya Aleksevna is inquiring about Louis XIV. Lopukhov assumes of course that 
she is asking about Philippe Egalité. 


114 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


But no, Marya Aleksevna wasn't satisfied by her own vigilance. She 
went so far as to arrange a test, as if she'd. studied the same rule of 
logic that I too learned by heart: The observation of phenomena that 
occur in and of themselves must be verified by experiments, con- 
ducted according to a well-formulated plan, in order to ensure the 
most profound insight into the mysteries of such relationships. She 
arranged a trial as if she’d read Saxon the Grammarian’s account of 
how Hamlet was tested in the forest by a maiden.*3 


viii. Hamlet’s Trial 


One day Marya Aleksevna announced at teatime that she had a 
headache; she poured out the tea, locked the sugarbowl, and then 
went off to lie down. Vera and Lopukhov remained sitting in the tea- 
room, which was right next to the bedroom where Marya Aleksevna 
had retired. In a few minutes the patient summoned Fedya. “Tell your 
sister that I can’t fall asleep while they're talking. Let them move some- 
where else where they won't disturb me. And say it nicely so that 
Dmitry Sergeich won't be offended. You know what good care he takes 
of you!” Fedya went and conveyed his mother’s request. “Why don't 
we move to my room, Dmitry Sergeich?” asked Verochka. “It’s far 
enough away from mother’s bedroom so that we won't disturb her.” 
That, of course, is exactly what Marya Aleksevna had expected. In a 
quarter of an hour she crept along in stocking feet, without her shoes, 
up to the door of Verochka’s room. It was half-open. Between the door 
and the jamb there was a nice crack. Marya Aleksevna applied her eye 
to it and pricked up her ears. This is what she saw: 

There were two windows in Verochka’s room with a writing desk 
standing between them. At one window, near one end of the desk, sat 
Verochka knitting a woolen scarf for her father, dutifully carrying out 
Marya Aleksevna’s orders. At the other window, near the other end of 
the desk, sat Lopukhov. He was leaning his elbow on the table and 
holding a cigar in his hand; his other hand was tucked into his pocket. 
Between them was a distance of some two arshins, perhaps more.*4 
Verochka was looking intently at her knitting, Lopukhov at his cigar. 
The seating arrangement was most reassuring. This is what she heard: 

“. . But must one view life in that way?” (These were the first words 
Marya Aleksevna overheard.) 


43. Saxon the Grammarian (c. 1150-1220) wrote Historia Danica, an account of the 
early Danish kingdom which contains the legend on which Shakespeare based his play 
Hamlet. The story relates how Hamlet cleverly exposed his enemies’ plans during a 
rendezvous with a beloved maiden.

“Yes, Vera Pavlovna, one must.” 

“In other words, those cold and practical people are telling the truth 
when they say that man is governed exclusively by the calculation of 
his own advantage?” 

“Yes, they are telling the truth. What we call sublime emotion or 
ideal aspiration—all that, in the general course of life, is completely 
insignificant in comparison with each person’s pursuit of his own 
advantage. And in essence these things constitute the same pursuit of 
advantage.” 

“Take you, for example. Are you that way?” 

“What other way would I be, Vera Pavlovna? Now you'll learn about 
the fundamental source of my life. Up to the present time the focus of 
my life has been my studies, preparing me to become a doctor. Excel- 
lent. Why did my father send me to the gymnasium? He used to repeat 
again and again, ‘Study, Mitya. When you've learned all you can, you'll 
become a civil servant. You'll support your mother and me and will 
enjoy a good life.’ That's why I studied; without that calculation my 
father would never have sent me to the gymnasium. Our family need- 
ed a wage earner. As for me, although I came to love my studies, I 
wouldn't have wasted the time if I hadn’t thought the investment 
would yield a good return. Soon I neared the end of my course in the 
gymnasium. I persuaded my father to let me enter the Medical Acade- 
my instead of taking a post in the civil service. How did this come 
about? My father and I realized that doctors live much better than low- 
ranking civil servants or even department heads, which was as high a 
rank as I could reach. That’s the reason I wound up in the Academy 
and why I stayed there: for a big hunk of bread. Without that calcula- 
tion I would neither have entered the Academy nor remained there.” 

“But surely you loved your studies in the gymnasium and then you 
came to love medical science?” 

“Yes, but that was icing on the cake. It may even be useful for 
achieving success. But while you can get along without icing, you can't 
manage without cake. Love forscience was only a result of the process, 
not its motive. My real motive has always been one and the same: 
advantage.” 

“Let's assume that you're right—yes, you are right. All actions, as far 
as I can see, can be explained by advantage. But isn’t that theory rather 
cold?” 

“Theory is supposed to be cold. The mind is supposed to make 
judgments about things coldly.’ 

“But it’s merciless.’ 

“It shows no mercy toward fantasies that are empty and harmful.’ 

“But it’s prosaic.” 

“Poetic form isn’t appropriate for science.” 


116 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“So this theory, whose validity I have no choice but to accept, con- 
demns people to a cold, pitiless, prosaic life?” 

“No, Vera Pavlovna. The theory is cold, but it teaches man how to 
procure warmth. A match is cold, as is the side of the matchbox 
against which it’s struck, as is the wood—but together they produce 
the fire that cooks our food and heats our bodies. This theory is piti- 
less, but by following it, people will cease to be pitiful objects of idle 
compassion. A lancet isn’t supposed to bend, or else we'd have to pity 
the patient, who'd be no better off for our pity. The theory is prosaic, 
but it reveals the genuine motives of life; poetry resides in the truth of 
life. Why is Shakespeare the greatest poet? Because his works contain 
more of the truth of life and less delusion than those of other poets.” 

“Then I too will be merciless, Dmitry Sergeich,” said Verochka with a 
smile. “Don’t be deluded into thinking that you've discovered in me a 
stubborn opponent to your theory regarding the calculation of advan- 
tage or that you’ve made a new convert. For some time I've been 
thinking along the same lines as I've read in your book and heard from 
you. But I used to think that these were my own personal thoughts, 
and that intelligent, learned people thought otherwise; therefore I 
hesitated. Most of what one used to read was written in opposition 
and is full of censure and sarcasm against what one observes in one- 
self and in others. Nature, life, and reason lead in one direction, while 
books lead in another by saying, ‘It’s all foolish and base.’ You know 
those objections I expressed to you were in part comical even to me.” 

“Yes, they are, Vera Pavlovna.” 

“However,” she said, laughing, “we're paying each other unusual 
compliments. I say, ‘Dmitry Sergeich, you shouldn't feel so smug.’ And 
you say, ‘You're very amusing with your doubts, Vera Pavlovna!” 

“Well,” said he, also with a smile, “it’s not in our own interests to pay 
compliments, so we don't pay compliments.” 

“Very well, Dmitry Sergeich. People are egoists, isn't that so? You've 
been talking about yourself; now I want to talk about myself.” 

“And so you should. Every person thinks about himself most of all.” 

“Very weil. Let's see if I can trip you up with some questions about 
me.” 

“Let's see.” 

“I have a wealthy suitor. I don’t like him. Must I accept his propos- 
al?” 

“Calculate what's the most advantageous for you.” 

“The most advantageous? You know that I’m not well off. On the 
one hand, there’s my dislike for the man; on the other, domination 
over him, an enviable position in society, wealth, and hordes of admir- 


” 


ers. 


What Is to Be Done? 117 


“Consider all aspects, then choose what’s most advantageous for 
you.” 

“And if I choose a rich husband and hordes of admirers?” 

“T'll say that you chose what you considered to be in your own best 
interest.” 

“And what will you feel compelled to say about me?” 

“If you acted dispassionately after thinking it all over carefully, then 
I'll say that you acted in a reasonable manner and most likely won't 
come to regret it.” 

“But will my choice be reprehensible?” 

“People who utter all sorts of nonsense may say what they like about 
it; people who possess a correct view of life will say that you acted as 
you should have. If you behaved as you did, it means that your person- 
ality is such that it was impossible for you to act differently under 
those circumstances. They will say that you acted out of necessity and, 
strictly speaking, you had no other choice.” 

“And there would be no censure for my choice?” 

“Who has the right to censure the consequences of facts, when 
these facts exist? Your personality in given circumstances constitutes 
a fact; your actions are necessary consequences of this fact, produced 
by the nature of things. You don't answer for them, and it’s absurd to 
censure them.” 

“You certainly don't retreat from your theory. So I won't earn your 
disapproval if I accept my suitor’s proposal?” 

“I would be stupid to censure you.” 

“And so I have your permission, perhaps even your approval, per- 
haps even your encouragement to proceed in such a manner?” 

“My advice is always the same: calculate what's advantageous; as 
soon as you follow that, you have my approval.” 

“Thank you. Now my personal affairs have been settled. Let’s return 
to the more general question. We began with the proposition that man 
acts out of necessity and that his actions are determined by the influ- 
ences under which these actions occur. Stronger influences take pre- 
cedence over weaker ones. We left the discussion as we reached the 
point where, when an action has everyday significance, these motives 
are Called ‘advantages,’ while their interplay in a person is called the 
‘consideration of advantage.’ Therefore, a man always acts according 
to the calculation of his own advantage. Have I correctly conveyed this 
line of thought?” 

“You have.” 

“You see what a good student I am. Now we've finished with this 
particular question about those actions that have everyday signifi- 
cance. But there are still some problems remaining with the general 


118 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


question. Your book states that man acts out of necessity. But there are 
some cases in which it seems that my decision to act in one way or 
another depends on my caprice. For example, I sit playing the piano, 
leafing through pages of music. Sometimes I turn the page with my left 
hand, sometimes with my right. Let’s say that I've just turned the page 
with my right hand; couldn't I have used my left? Doesn't it depend on 
my caprice?” 

“No, Vera Pavlovna. If you turn the pages without thinking which 
hand to use, then you'll use the hand that’s more convenient—there’s 
no question of caprice. If you think, ‘Let me turn the page with my 
right hand,’ then you’d do so under the influence of that idea, but the 
idea wouldn't have come from your caprice; it would have been a 
necessary result of other . . .”45 

On this last word Marya Aleksevna ceased her eavesdropping. “Well, 
now they've entered higher realms—it’s way beyond me, and I have 
no need for it. What an intelligent, reliable, one might even say noble 
young man! What sensible rules he instills into Verochka! That's what 
it means to be educated: why, if I were to tell her the same thing, she 
wouldn’t listen to me and would even take offense. I couldn’t please 
her because I can’t talk in that educated way. But as soon as he starts 
talking to her like that, she listens and sees that it’s all true and she 
agrees. Yes, the old saying is true: Learning is light and ignorance is 
darkness. If I'd been brought up with some learning, would things still 
be the way they are now? I'd have had my husband promoted to the 
rank of general; I'd have gotten him a position in the provisions de- 
partment, or in something else just as good. Well, of course I'd have to 
handle all his dealings with suppliers. He’d be a disaster! And I'd have 
built a much nicer house than this one. I'd have bought more than a 
thousand serfs. But now I can't. First of all, you have to show yourself 
to advantage in society. How can I do that when I don't speak a word 
of French, or any other language, for that matter? They'd say she has 
no manners and is only fit to swear in the Haymarket. It just won't do. 
Ignorance is darkness. Yes, indeed: learning is light and ignorance is 
darkness.” 

It was precisely this overheard conversation that led Marya Aleksev- 
na to the conclusion not only that her daughter's conversations with 
Dmitry Sergeich were not dangerous for Verochka (she’d realized this 
before), but that they'd even be of some use to her and would assist her 
efforts to persuade Verochka to forsake her stupid, naive, girlish no-

tions and bring the question of her engagement to Mikhail Ivanych toa 
swift and happy conclusion. 


ix. 


Marya Aleksevna’s relations with Lopukhov verge on farce and show 
her in a comic guise. Both of these outcomes are decidedly unin- 
tended. If I had wanted to concern myself with what we usually call 
artistic merit, I would have concealed Marya Aleksevna’s relations with 
Lopukhov, the account of which lends an air of vaudeville to this part 
of the novel. It would have been very easy to conceal them. The essen- 
tial development of the story could have been explained without them. 
Would it have been surprising if, even without his friendship with 
Marya Aleksevna, the tutor had had the opportunity to exchange a few 
words with the young woman whose brother he was tutoring? Are that 
many words really needed in order for love to flourish? There was no 
need for Marya Aleksevna’s cooperation to guarantee the outcome of 
Verochka’s meeting with Lopukhov. But I'm recounting this affair the 
way it happened, rather than the way needed to establish my artistic 
reputation. As a novelist I very much regret that I wrote several pages 
in which I stooped to the level of vaudeville. 

My intention to present this affair as it really was, and not as it 
would be most convenient to relate, creates yet another unpleasant 
problem. I am displeased that Marya Aleksevna is shown in such a 
comic light with her reflections on the fiancée (thought up by Lopu- 
khov), or with her fantastic speculations on the content of the books 
that Lopukhov gave Verochka to read, or with her discussion on 
whether Philippe Egalité converted his subjects to Catholicism, or 
what kind of books were written by Louis XIV. Everyone makes mis- 
takes and these mistakes can become ridiculous if a person is discuss- 
ing matters about which he knows nothing. But it would be unjust to 
conclude from Marya Aleksevna’s ridiculous blunders that her favor- 
able opinion of Lopukhov was based on these trifles alone. No, indeed. 
No fantasies about a rich fiancée or a pious Philippe Egalité would 
have clouded her common sense for one moment if she'd noticed 
anything the least bit suspicious in Lopukhov’s actual words and be- 
havior. But he really did behave himself in precisely the way that 
Marya Aleksevna thought only a person of her own ilk would. Why, 
here was a spry young man who didn’t peek into the corset of an 
attractive young woman, who did not go trailing around behind her, 
and who played cards with Marya Aleksevna without making excuses, 


120 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


without pleading, “I'd better go sit and chat with Vera Pavlovna.” He 
discussed various matters in a way that seemed to Marya Aleksevna to 
approximate her own. Just like her, he said that everything was based 
on advantage; that when a scoundrel acted like a scoundrel, there was 
no reason to get excited and whine about principles of honor that he 
ought to be observing; that the scoundrel was not a scoundrel for 
nothing, that he had to be one because of his circumstances, that not 
to be a scoundrel (apart from the fact that this was an impossibilitv) 
would be silly on his part, even downright absurd. Yes, Marya Aleksev- 
Na was quite right to realize that she and Lopukhov had a great deal in 
common. 

I understand how much Lopukhov is compromised in the eyes of 
my enlightened public by Marya Aleksevna’s sympathy for his way of 
thinking. But I don’t wish to play favorites and won't conceal the 
evidence, even if it’s harmful to Lopukhov's reputation, although I have 
just proved how I could have hidden the more unsavory side of his 
relations with the Rozalsky family. I shall do even more: I shall now 
explain how it was that he actually deserved Marya Aleksevna's favor. 

Indeed, as has been demonstrated by the conversation between 
Lopukhov and Verochka, his way of thinking would appeal much more 
to people of Marya Aleksevna’s ilk than to the eloquent advocates of 
various sublime ideals. Lopukhov saw things in the same way they 
appear to the large mass of humanity, except for these advocates of 
sublime ideals. If Marya Aleksevna could repeat with considerable 
pleasure his advice to Verochka concerning Storeshnikov’s proposal, 
then, with the same pleasure, he could attest to the veracity of her 
drunken confession to Verochka. The similarity between their views 
was so great that enlightened and high-minded novelists, journalists, 
and other instructors of our public have long since proclaimed: “Peo- 
ple such as Lopukhov are no different from Marya Aleksevna and her 
ilk.” If such enlightened and high-minded writers have thus under- 
stood people such as Lopukhov, can we really condemn Marya Alek- 
sevna for not seeing in him anything but what our best writers, think- 
ers, and teachers have seen? 

Of course, if Marya Aleksevna had known even half of what these 
writers know, she'd have been smart enough to realize that Lopukhov 
was a bad match for her. However, in addition to the fact that she was 
ignorant, she had one other excuse for her mistake. Lopukhov had 
never said to her all that he could have. He was a propagandist, but not 
quite like the lovers of sublime ideals who constantly attempt to instill 
in the various Marya Aleksevnas the high-minded notions with which 
they are so entranced within their own selves. He had enough good 
sense not to attempt to straighten out a fifty-year-old gnarled tree. 


What Is to Be Done? 121 


Both he and she understood the facts in the same way and discussed 
them between themselves. As a man with a theoretical education, he 
could arrive at conclusions from certain facts—something that people 
like Marya Aleksevna couldn't do because they knew nothing except 
their everyday, personal cares and common aphorisms of popular, 
universal wisdom: proverbs, sayings, and other similar old, aged, age- 
old, and ancient pronouncements. As for conclusions, the two of them 
never went that far. If, for example, he had begun to explain the mean- 
ing of “advantage” (which he’d discussed with Verochka), Marya Alek- 
sevna would probably have winced, realizing that the advantage of his 
advantage was not exactly the same as that of her advantage. But 
Lopukhov didn't explain this to her, nor did he explain it in his conver- 
sations with Verochka, because she already understood the meaning 
of this word from the books that formed the basis of their conversa- 
tion. Of course, it’s true that in attesting to the veracity of Marya 
Aleksevna’s drunken confession, Lopukhov would have added: “Since 
by your own admission, Marya Aleksevna, the new ways are better 
than the old, I don't forbid those people who take pleasure in it to 
work to establish the new order. Regarding the stupidity of people, a 
factor you consider to be an obstacle to setting up the new order, I’m 
in complete agreement with you. It is an obstacle. But, Marya Aleksev- 
na, you yourself won't argue when I say that people become smarter 
rather quickly when they realize that it’s to their advantage to do so, 
though they hadn't noticed the necessity of doing so before. You'll also 
agree that they've had no previous opportunity to acquire this intelli- 
gence; but if you provide them with this opportunity, then they'll 
gladly make use of it.” But he didn’t bring the conversation to this 
point with Marya Aleksevna—not out of cautiousness, though he was 
cautious, but simply because of the same good sense and decorum 
that kept him from conversing with her in Latin or burdening her with 
the latest medical discoveries that he himself found so interesting. He 
possessed sufficient intelligence and discretion to refrain from inflict- 
ing on a person pronouncements that he or she could never under- 
stand. 

But everything I say is intended to excuse Marya Aleksevna for not 
managing to sniff out what sort of man Lopukhov really was, and not 
as an excuse for Lopukhov himself. It would not be appropriate to 
exonerate him; the reasons will be made clear soon enough. While not 
exonerating him, some people might wish to excuse him out of love for 
their fellow man; they should not do so. For example, they might use 
the excuse that he was a medical student who studied natural science, 
and that this predisposed him to a materialist point of view. But that 
kind of excuse is very poor. There are any number of sciences that 


122 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


predispose one to this view: mathematics, history, social science, and 
all sorts of others. Is it really true that all geometers, astronomers, 
historians, political economists, jurisprudents, publicists, and many 
other sorts of scholars are all materialists? Far from it! In other words, 
Lopukhov does not escape blame. Compassionate people who do not 
seek to exonerate him could also say in his defense that he’s not 
completely devoid of several praiseworthy characteristics: he made 
the firm and conscious decision to refuse any material rewards and 
honors for the work he did for others, finding that the best reward was 
pleasure in the work itself. And when he met a young woman who was 
so pretty that he fell in love with her, he decided to treat her with a 
chaste regard, purer than that with which many brothers regard their 
own sisters. But, in reply to this defense of his materialism, it must be 
stated that no man is completely devoid of redeeming characteristics, 
and that materialists, whatever they are, are still materialists; and by 
that very fact alone it is resolved and proved that they are base and 
amoral people who cannot be excused, because to do so would con- 
stitute a display of indulgence toward their materialism. Therefore, 
without exonerating Lopukhov, no excuse is possible. Nor can he be 
exonerated because the lovers of sublime ideals and the defenders of 
exalted aspirations, who have declared that materialists are base and 
amoral people, have lately shown themselves to such advantage, from 
the point of view of both intelligence and character, in the eyes of all 
decent people (materialists and nonmaterialists alike), that it now 
seems superfluous to defend anyone against their censure, while to 
direct attention to their words has become indecent behavior. 


Needless to say, the main theme of conversation between Verochka 
and Lopukhov was not which way of thinking should be considered 
the more justified. In general they spoke very little with each other, 
and their long conversations, being so infrequent, concerned only 
peripheral topics, such as ways of thinking and other such subjects. 
For they knew that a pair of very acute eyes was following their every 
move. Therefore, they exchanged few words about the main subject 
that concerned them both, and usually only when they were choosing 
music for playing and singing. The main subject, which was allotted so 
little time in their not very frequent long conversations, and which did 
not play a very significant role even in their short exchanges, this 
subject was not their feelings for each other. No, they did not exchange 


What Is to Be Done? 123 


so much as a word about them after their few vague words in their 
very first conversation on that festive evening. They had no time to 
discuss such matters. In the two or three minutes available for the 
exchange of ideas without fear of being overheard, they hardly man- 
aged to treat the one main subject—namely, the efforts and plans 
about how and when Verochka could be delivered from her terrible 
predicament. And this fact left them neither the time nor the inclina- 
tion to discuss feelings. 

The morning after their very first conversation Lopukhov investi- 
gated the means by which one can become an actress. He knew that a 
young girl would face many unpleasant dangers en route to a career 
on the stage, but he assumed that with her strength of character she 
might eventually achieve her goal honorably. It turned out not to be so. 
Two days later when he came for his lesson he had to tell Verochka, “I 
advise you to give up the idea of becoming an actress.” “Why?” “Be- 
cause you'd even do better to accept your suitor’s proposal.” That was 
the end of the conversation. This was said as they were leafing through 
music, he to play and she to sing. Verochka felt depressed and several 
times lost the beat, even though she was singing a song she knew well. 
When the piece was over and they began to discuss which one to 
choose next, Verochka managed to say: “That seemed the best way. It 
was painful to hear that it’s not possible. But no matter. It will be 
harder for me to go on, but go on I will. I shall become a governess.” 

When he returned two days later she said: “I could not find out how 
one goes about looking fora position as governess. Could you help me, 
Dmitry Sergeich? I have no one besides you.” 

“It's a pity that I have so few acquaintances who might now be 
useful. The families in which I give lessons or used to are all people of 
modest means, and so are their acquaintances, but I'll try.” 

“My friend, I’m taking up your time, but I have no other choice.” 

“Vera Pavlovna, you musn’t worry about my time—since now I am 
your friend.” 

Verochka smiled and blushed. She'd failed to notice that she'd re- 
placed the name “Dmitry Sergeich” with the words “my friend.” 

Lopukhov smiled too. 

“You didn’t mean to say that, Vera Pavlovna. You may take it back if 
you regret it.” 

Vera smiled again. “Too late,” she said, and blushed again, “but I 
don't regret it,” she added, blushing even more. 

“If necessary, you'll see what a loyal friend I can be.” 

They shook hands. 

You have now heard in their entirety their first two conversations 
after that festive evening. 


124 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Two days later in the Police Gazette*® there appeared a notice to the 
effect that a young gentlewoman able to speak French, German, etc., 
was seeking a position as a governess. Inquiries should be sent to So- 
and-so, at such-and-such an address, in Kolomna.*” 

Lopukhov now found it necessary to devote a great deal of time to 
Verochka’s affairs. Every morning he set off, usually on foot, and went 
from the Vyborg district to his acquaintance in Kolomna, whose ad- 
dress was listed in the announcement. The distance was considerable, 
but he was unable to locate a suitable acquaintance who lived any 
closer to the Vyborg district. Necessity required that the acquaintance 
meet a number of conditions: a decent apartment, reasonable family 
circumstances, and a respectable appearance. A poor apartment 
would result in offers of inadequate conditions for the governess. If the 
reference were to lack respectability and a good family situation, it 
would reflect adversely on the young woman he was recommending. 
Of course Lopukhov couldn't use his own address in the announce- 
ment. What would people think of a young woman if the only person 
assisting her was a poor student? Thus Lopukhov got his exercise. 
After collecting from his acquaintance the addresses of those who'd 
come to make inquiries about the governess, he continued his expedi- 
tion. The acquaintance said that he was the young woman’s distant 
relative and was only acting as an intermediary, but that she had a 
nephew who would stop by the following day to negotiate conditions. 
The nephew arrived (on foot, and not in a carriage), inspected the 
prospects, and, needless to say, was usually dissatisfied by what he 
observed. One family was too arrogant; in another, the mother was all 
right, but the father was a fool; in a third, the opposite was true. In 
those families where one could actually survive, the conditions were 
unsuitable for Verochka, or she had to know English, which she didn’t; 
or they really wanted a nanny instead of a governess; or the people 
were all right, although poor, but there was no room in the apartment 
for Verochka, except in the nursery—where there were already two 
young children, two infants, a nanny, and a wetnurse. But the an- 
nouncement continued to appear in the Police Gazette, inquiries con- 
tinued to arrive from those seeking governesses, and Lopukhov did not 
lose hope. ‘ 

This search continued for another two weeks. On the fifth day, when 
Lopukhov returned from his trekking around Petersburg and lay down 
on his couch, Kirsanov said to him, “Dmitry, you have became a poor 
partner in our work. Every day you disappear for the whole morning, 


46. Vedomosti S.-Peterburgskoi gorodskoi politsii, an official gazette published from 
1839 to 1883. 

47. An outlying, predominantly poor and working-class district of St. Petersburg near 
Pokrovsky (Protector's) Square (now called Turgenev Square). 


What Is to Be Done? 125 


and half the time you disappear in the evenings as well. Perhaps 
you're giving too many lessons. Is this the right time to take on more? 
I'd like to drop those I already have. I've got about forty rubles— 
enough to last three months, until the end of term. Don’t you have 
even more money stowed away, a hundred rubles or so?” 

“More—almost a hundred fifty. But I’m not giving lessons. I 
dropped them all except for one. I have some business to attend to. 
When I finish it, you won't be able to complain about my being so poor 
a colleague.” 

“What sort of business?” 

“Well, you see, the household where I'm still giving lessons, al- 
though the family itself is rotten, includes a decent young woman. She 
wants to become a governess to escape from that household. I’m 
looking for a position for her.” 

“Is she a worthy young woman?” 

“She is.” 

“Well, that’s good. Keep looking.” And with that their conversation 
ended. 

Hey, Messrs. Kirsanov and Lopukhov! You are both learned men, but 
you haven't guessed how really good it is! Let’s suppose that what you 
were talking about is also good. Kirsanov never even thought of asking 
whether the young woman was pretty, and Lopukhov never thought of 
mentioning it. Kirsanov never thought of saying, “My friend, you 
haven't fallen in love, have you? Look at how much effort youre going 
to!” And Lopukhov never thought of saying, “Well, my friend, I’ve be- 
come very interested in her.” Or, if he didn’t want to say that, he never 
thought of staving off such a guess by saying, “I don’t want you to 
think, Alexander, that I’ve fallen in love.” You see, both of them con- 
sidered that when the business concerned the deliverance of another 
person from a bad situation, it was entirely irrelevant whether or not 
that person (even if that person happened to be a young woman) had a 
pretty face; and as for falling in love or not falling in love, that didn’t 
even come up for discussion. They were not even aware of the fact that 
they were thinking this. And that is precisely what's the best thing 
about it. They were not even aware that they were thinking this. 

However, doesn't this demonstrate to the perspicacious sort of read- 
er (as it does to the majority of ordinary men of letters, consisting of 
the most perspicacious gentlemen), does this not demonstrate, I re- 
peat, that Kirsanov and Lopukhov were both withered men, devoid of 
any “aesthetic streak’?48 Not long ago this phrase was fashionable 


48. A sarcastic reference to a group of writers and literary critics, including Vasily 
Botkin (1811-1869) and Alexander Druzhinin (1824-1864), who opposed Chernyshevsky's 
political views and advocated art for art's sake in contrast to his materialist and social 
utilitarian aesthetic. 


126 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


among aesthetic men of letters who possessed elevated aspirations. 
“Aesthetic streak.” Perhaps it's still in vogue among them. I don't 
know, since I haven’t seen them for quite a while. Is it natural that two 
young men possessing even the least drop of good taste and a glimmer 
of feeling wouldn't be interested in the subject of good looks when 
they talked about a young woman? Of course, these are men who lack 
any artistic emotion (aesthetic streak). According to the opinions of 
others who have studied human nature in circles richer in aesthetic 
emotion than even a group of our own aesthetic men of letters, young 
men in similar situations will infallibly discuss a woman precisely 
within the context of her physical appearance. But that was the way it 
used to be, gentlemen; not any more. That may be the way it still is, but 
not among the group of our young people who are now referred to as 
“modern youth.” These young people, gentlemen, are somewhat 
strange.

“Well, my friend, still no luck?” 

“Not yet, Vera Pavlovna. But don't despair: something will turn up. 
I'm visiting two or three households every day. Surely a decent one 
will turn up sooner or later.” 

“Ah, but if you only knew how hard, my friend, how very hard it is 
for me to remain here. When I could not imagine how near was the 
chance to escape from this humiliation and filth, then I forced myself 
into a kind of lifeless stupor. But now, my friend, it’s too hard to 
breathe in this foul, putrid air.” 

“Patience, Vera Pavlovna, patience. We'll find something!” 

This kind of conversation went on for a week. 

On Tuesday: “Patience, Vera Pavlovna, patience. We'll find some- 
thing.” 

“My friend, I’m causing you such trouble and youre losing so much 
time! How shall I ever repay you?” 

“You will repay me, my friend, if you don't get angry at me.” 

Lopukhov said this and became flustered. Verochka looked at him. 
No, it wasn’t that he hadn't finished what he had to say. He hadn't 
intended to go on and was waiting for some answer from her. 

“But whatever for, my friend? What have you done?” 

Lopukhov became even more flustered and seemed to grow a bit 
sad. 

“What's the matter, my friend?” 

“No, you haven't even noticed,” he said gloomily, and then he began 


What Is to Be Done? 127 


laughing very cheerfully. “Oh, my God,” he said, “how stupid I am, how 
very stupid! Forgive me, my friend.” 

“What on earth for?” 

“Never mind. You've already repaid me.” 

“Ah, so that’s it! What a character you are!” 

“All right, call me what you will.” 

On Thursday there occurred the trial of Hamlet according to Saxon 
the Grammarian. For several days afterward Marya Aleksevna took 
some respite (a very brief one) from her supervision. 

Saturday. After tea Marya Aleksevna went to check the linen re- 
turned by the laundress. 

“My friend, it seems that something can be arranged.” 

“Really? If only ...oh, Lord . . .oh, my Lord, the sooner, the better! I 
think I'll die if this goes on much longer. When will it be? And how?” 

“It will be decided tomorrow. It's almost certain, almost.” 

“What? How?” 

“Calm down, my friend, or we'll be noticed. You're nearly jumping 
for joy. Marya Aleksevna could come back in for something at any 
moment.” 

“You're a fine one to talk. You came in here so radiant that mama 
could hardly take her eyes off you.” 

“What of it? I told her why I was so cheerful. I realized that I had to 
tell her something, so I said, ‘I've found an excellent position.’” 

“You're intolerable, simply intolerable! You dwell on warnings, but 
you still haven't told me what the offer is. Go on, tell me.” 

“This morning Kirsanov—you know, my friend, that my comrade’s 
name is Kirsanov. . . .” 

“IT know that, you insufferable man! Tell me immediately, without 
any nonsense.” 

“You keep interrupting me, my friend.” 

“Oh, my Lord! Still reprimanding instead of telling me about the 
offer. I don’t know what to do with you! I'd make you go down on your 
knees, but I can’t do that here. I order you to fall to your knees in your 
own apartment and I want to receive a note from Kirsanov telling me 
that you've done so. Do you hear what I shall do with you?” 

“All right, I'll go down on my knees. But for now I'll keep silent. After 
I've carried out the punishment and have been forgiven, then I'll 
speak.” 

“I forgive you, you intolerable man, only tell me.” 

“Thank you. But you have forgiven me, Vera Pavlovna, when you 
yourself are to blame. You keep on interrupting.” 

“What’s this? You called me Vera Pavlovna? What ever happened to 
‘my friend?” 


128 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“It was a reprimand, my friend. I'm a stern judge and quick to take 
offense.” 

“A reprimand? How dare you reprimand me? I don’t want to listen 
to you.” 

“You don't?” 

“Of course not. What else is there to hear? You've said everything 
already: the offer is almost certain and will be settled tomorrow. You 
see, my friend, you still know very little today. What else is there to 
hear? Good-bye, my friend.” 

“But just listen, my friend. .. . My friend, listen to me.” 

“I won't and I’m leaving. There now, I’ve returned. Now tell me 
immediately and I won't interrupt. Oh, my Lord, if only you knew how 
you've cheered me up! Give me your hand. You see how warmly I clasp 
it, how very warmly.” 

“But why are there tears in your eyes?” 

“Thank you. Thank you.” 

“This morning Kirsanov gave me the address of a lady with whom I 
have an appointment tomorrow. I’m not personally acquainted with 
her, but I've heard a great deal about her from our mutual acquain- 
tance who acted as an intermediary. I know her husband; we've met 
many times at the home of this acquaintance. Judging by all of this, I’m 
sure that life in their household will be tolerable. And when she gave 
her address to my acquaintance to pass along to me, she said she was 
certain that we could come to an agreement on the terms. In other 
words, my friend, one can consider that the matter is almost entirely 
settled.” 

“Oh, how splendid that will be! What joy!” Verochka kept repeating. 
“But I want to know soon, as soon as possible. After you see her will 
you come right to us?” 

“No, my friend. That would arouse suspicion. I come here only to 
give lessons. Here’s what we'll do. I will send a letter to Marya Aleksev- 
na saying that I can’t come on Tuesday and would like to move the 
lesson to Wednesday. If it says ‘Wednesday morning,’ that will mean 
that the matter is settled. If it says ‘Wednesday evening,’ then it’s fallen 
through. But it’s almost sure to say ‘Wednesday morning.’ Marya Alek- 
sevna will tell Fedya, and you, and Pavel Konstantinych.” 

“When will the letter arrive?” 

“In the evening.” 

“So long to wait! No, I won’t have the patience. And what will I learn 
from the letter? Only yes. And then I'll have to wait until Wednesday! 
What torture! If it’s yes, then I want to leave here as soon as possible. 
I'll want to know immediately. How can we arrange it? Here’s what I'll 


What Is to Be Done? 129 


do. I'll wait for you on the street after you leave your appointment with 
the lady.” 

“My friend, that would be even more indiscreet than if I came here 
directly. No, it would be better if I came.” 

“No, it might not be possible to talk here. In any case mama would 
get suspicious. No, my plan is better. I have a thick veil and no one will 
recognize me.” 

“Well, it might actually work. Let me think a minute.” 

“There's no time to think. Mama could come back at any moment. 
Where does this lady live?” 

“On Galernaya [Galley] Street, next to the bridge.” 

“What time will you be there?” 

“The appointment is set for noon.” 

“From twelve o'clock on I'll be sitting on the last bench along Kon- 
nogvardeisky (Horseguard] Boulevard at the end closest to the bridge. I 
said I'd be wearing a thick veil. But here's a clue: I'll be holding a sheaf 
of music. If I’m not there, it means I've been delayed. But you should 
sit down on that bench and wait for me. I may be late, but I'll definitely 
come. What a good plan! I'm so grateful to you! How happy I'll be! And 
how's your fiancée, Dmitry Sergeich? You've just been demoted from 
my friend to Dmitry Sergeich. How happy I am, how very happy!” 
Verochka ran to the piano and started to play. 

“My friend, what degradation of art! What debasement of good taste! 
Operatic arias abandoned for a sprightly galop.”49 

“Yes indeed!” 

A few moments later Marya Aleksevna came in. Dmitry Sergeich 
played a game of two-handed preference with her; at first he was 
winning; then he allowed her to recoup, and finally he lost 35 kopecks. 
It was the first time he had allowed her such a triumph, and he left 
with her feeling very satisfied indeed, not with the money, but with the 
victory itself. Even those hearts that are most mired in materialism can 
know purely idealistic joys—which goes to show that the materialistic 
explanation of life is unsatisfactory. 


xii. Verochka’s First Dream 
And Verochka has a dream. 
She dreams that she’s locked up in a damp, dark cellar. Suddenly 


the door flies open and she finds herself in a field, running about and 


49. A lively French dance in 2/4 time. 


130 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


skipping. She thinks, “How did I not die in that cellar? It’s because I 
had not yet seen this field; if I had, then surely I would have died in the 
cellar.” And once again she is running about and skipping. 

Now she dreams that she’s stricken by paralysis and thinks, “How 
can I be paralyzed? This happens only to old men and women, not to 
young girls.” “Oh, yes, it does, very often,” says an unfamiliar voice. 
“But now, as soon as I touch your hand, you'll be cured. You see, 
you're cured already. Get up!” “Who's that talking? How much better I 
feel! The illness has passed.” And Verochka stands, walks, and runs; 
once again she’s in the field, skipping and running. Again she thinks, 
“How could I have endured that paralysis? It’s because I was born 
paralyzed and didn’t know that others can walk and run. If I'd known, 
then surely I couldn’t have endured it.” And she runs and skips. 

Now she sees a young woman walking across the field. How strange! 
Both her face and her gait, everything about her keeps changing, con- 
stantly changing. First she’s English, then French; now she's German, 
then Polish; she becomes Russian, English again, then German, again 
Russian. How can it be that she has one and the same face? Surely an 
English girl doesn’t resemble a French girl, or a German a Russian. 
Even though her face keeps changing, she still has the same face. What 
a strange creature! And her expression changes constantly, too: how 
meek, how angry, then sad, then cheerful. Everything keeps changing! 
Still, she’s so kind. How can it be that even when she’s angry, she’s still 
so kind? And what a beauty she is! Although her face keeps changing, 
it becomes even more beautiful with every transformation. The girl 
approaches Verochka. 

“Who are you?” 

“He used to call me Vera Pavlovna, but now he calls me ‘my friend.’” 

“Oh, so it’s you, the same Verochka who fell in love with me?” 

“Yes, I love you very much. But who are you?” 

“I am the bride of your bridegroom.” 

“Which bridegroom?” 

“I don’t know. I don’t know all my bridegrooms. They know me, but 
it’s impossible for me to know them. I have so many. Choose a bride- 
groom for yourself from among them. I want all my sisters and my 
bridegrooms to choose only each other. Were you locked up in a 
cellar? Were you stricken by paralysis?” 

“T was.” 

“And have you been delivered now?” 

“T have.” 

“It was I who released you, and I who cured you. Remember that 
there are still many who have not yet been released and not yet cured. 
Release them. Cure them. Will you do it?” 


What Is to Be Done? 131 


“T will. But what’s your name? I’m so eager to know it.” 

“I have many different names. I tell each person the name he should 
use. You shall call me Love of Humanity. That’s my real name. Not 
many people use it. But that’s what you shall call me.” 

Now Verochka is walking through a town. She comes upon a cellar 
where some young girls are locked up. Verochka touches the lock and 
it falls away. “Come out,” she says, and they do. She comes upon a 
room where some young girls are paralyzed. “Get up,” she says, and 
they do. They stand and begin to walk. And now they're all out in the 
field, running about and skipping once again. Oh, what fun! How 
much nicer it is to be together with them than to be all alone! Oh, what 
fun!

Of late Lopukhov had very little time to spend with his academic 
associates. Kirsanov, who did keep up with them, happened to men- 
tion in reply to their questions what was occupying so much of Lopu- 
khov's time. As we know, it was one of these mutual acquaintances 
who provided the address of the lady Lopukhov was now going to see. 

“How wonderfully things will be arranged, if it all works out,” Lopu- 
khov thought on his way to see her. “In two years, at the most two and 
a half, I'll have a position at the university. Then I'll be able to earn a 
living. Meanwhile she'll be living harmoniously with Madame B., if 
only Madame B. really is a fine woman, as I have no reason to doubt.” 

And indeed Lopukhov discovered that Madame B. was a kind and 
intelligent woman, with no pretensions, even though because of her 
husband's position, her own fortune, and her family she could have 
had considerable pretensions. The terms she proposed were fair, the 
household was most suitable for Verochka, and everything was turn- 
ing out extremely well, just as Lopukhov had expected. Madame B., for 
her part, found Lopukhov’s answers to her questions about Verochka’s 
character most satisfactory. Everything was moving ahead well. After 
half an hour more of discussion, Madame B. said, “If your young aunt 
finds my terms agreeable, then I'll invite her to accept the position and 
move in, the sooner the better as far as I’m concerned.” 

“She finds them agreeable. She has authorized me to act on her 
behalf. But now that we've settled the affair, I must tell you something 
that wasn’t worth mentioning before we reached our agreement. This 
girl is no relative of mine. She's the daughter of a civil servant in whose 
family I give lessons. Except for me, she had no one to whom she 
could entrust this matter. But I’m not related to her in any way.” 


132 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“I knew that, Monsieur Lopukhov. You, Professor N.” (she named the 
person who had provided her with the address), “and your comrade 
who spoke with him about this matter all know each other to be 
sufficiently honorable so that you could discuss your friendship with a 
young woman without compromising her in the eyes of the other two. 
Professor N. has a similar opinion of me; knowing that I was looking for 
a governess, he considered it within his rights to tell me that this 
young woman wasn't your relative. Don't blame him for his indiscre- 
tion. He knows me very well. I'm also an honest person, Monsieur 
Lopukhov, and I too understand who deserves respect. I trust Pro- 
fessor N. as much as I trust myself and as much as he trusts you. But 
Professor N. didn’t know her name; now it seems that I can ask you 
what it is, since we have concluded our discussion and either today or 
tomorrow she will be joining our household.” 

“Her name is Vera Pavlovna Rozalskaya.” 

“Now I have something else to explain. It may seem strange to you, 
given my solicitude for my children, that I’ve decided to settle this 
affair with you, never having seen the young woman who will have 
such a close relationship with my children. But I know very, very well 
the kind of people who belong to your circle. I know that if one of you 
takes such a friendly interest in another person, then that person must 
be arare find for a mother who wants her own daughter to become a 
truly fine person. Therefore a personal inspection seems completely 
unnecessary and inappropriate. I’m paying a compliment to myself, 
and not to you.” 

“I’m very pleased now for Mademoiselle Rozalskaya. Her own home 
life is so awful that she would be very happy in any decent household. 
But I never imagined that she would enjoy the truly wonderful life that 
awaits her in your home.” 

“Yes, Professor N. told me that she has a difficult life at home.” 

“Very difficult.” Lopukhov began to tell Madame B. all that she 
needed to know so that in her conversations with Verochka she could 
avoid all subjects that would remind the girl of past unpleasantness. 
Madame B. listened sympathetically and at last shook Lopukhov's 
hand and said, “No more, Monsieur Lopukhov, or else I shall break 
down completely. At my age” (almost forty), “it would be absurd to 
reveal that I still can’t listen with equanimity to an account of family 
tyranny such as I myself endured during my youth.” 

“Allow me to say one more thing. You'll probably consider it of so 
little importance that it may not even be worth mentioning. Still, it’s 
better to warn you. This young woman is running away from a match 
that is being forced upon her by her mother.” 


What Is to Be Done? 133 


Madame B. became more thoughtful. Lopukhov looked at her for 
some time and became more thoughtful, too. 

“If I'm not mistaken, this circumstance does not seem as insignifi- 
cant to you as I'd hoped?” 

Madame B. appeared to be terribly upset. 

“Forgive me,” he continued, seeing how upset she was. “Forgive me, 
but I see that it disturbs you.” 

“Yes, it's a very serious matter, Monsieur Lopukhov. Leaving home 
against your parents’ wishes could provoke a major quarrel. But, as J 
told you, that doesn’t matter. If she were escaping merely from their 
coarseness and tyranny, it would still be possible to smoothe over the 
difficulty one way or another; in the last resort one could expend a 
certain sum of money and they would be content. That’s insignificant. 
But ... when that kind of mother is forcing a match—it means that 
the suitor is wealthy and the match advantageous.” 

“Of course,” said Lopukhov despondently. 

“Of course, Monsieur Lopukhov, of course he's wealthy. That is pre- 
cisely what disturbs me. In such a case the mother can never be 
appeased. And you know about the rights of parents!®° In this instance 
they would take full advantage of them. They would initiate a lawsuit 
and carry it through to the end.” 

Lopukhov rose. 

“And so I've only to ask you to forget everything I've said to you.” 

“No, wait. At least let me vindicate myself somehow. Good Lord, I 
must seem very nasty to you now. The thing that must make any 
decent person feel sympathy and spring to the girl's defense gives me 
pause. Oh, what pitiful beings we are!” 

It was pitiful indeed to look at her: she wasn't feigning. She really 
was in great distress. She was so embarrassed that for quite a while her 
speech was rather incoherent; then she managed to compose her 
thoughts. But, whether incoherent or composed, her words conveyed 
no new information to Lopukhov. And by now he himself was quite 
upset. He was so preoccupied by what she'd just disclosed to him that 
he couldn't concern himself with her explanations on the occasion of 
the disclosure. After he'd allowed her to have her say, he spoke: 

“Everything you've said in your own defense has been in vain. I was 
obliged to stay so as not to appear rude or to make you think that I 
blame you or that I'm angry. But I must confess that I wasn’t really 
listening to you. Oh, if only I didn’t know that you were absolutely

their children, including the power to have them incarcerated for disobedience. See also 
n. 66 below. 


134 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


right. Yes, how splendid it would be if you were wrong. I'd tell her that 
we couldn't agree on terms or that you weren't to my liking, and that’s 
all there was to it. She and I could continue to hope that we'd find 
another opportunity for deliverance. But now, what can I possibly tell 
her?” 

Madame B. began to weep. 

“What can I tell her?” repeated Lopukhov as he descended the 
stairs. “What will she do? What will she do?” he wondered as he 
turned from Galernaya Street into the lane that leads to Konnogvar- 
deisky Boulevard. 


Needless to say, Madame B. was not absolutely right in the way 
grownups are when they prove to children that they can’t reach out 
and touch the moon. Given her own status in society and the rather 
important connections stemming from her husband's position, it was 
very likely, even certain, that if she really had wanted Verochka to live 
in her household, Marya Aleksevna could not have snatched her 
daughter away, nor could she have created any serious unpleasant- 
ness either for her or for her husband, who would have been the 
official respondents in the case, and whose welfare she had in mind. 
Nevertheless, Madame B. would have incurred a great deal of trouble, 
and perhaps even a few unpleasant exchanges. She would have had to 
ask favors of various people, whose services it might have been better 
to reserve for her own needs, not for those of others. Who is obligated, 
and what reasonable person would wish to behave any differently? We 
have no right whatever to condemn Madame B. And Lopukhov was 
not wrong to despair over Verochka’s deliverance. 


xiv. 


Meanwhile Verochka sat for a very long while on the agreed-upon 
bench; each and every time a peaked service cap came around the 
corner, her heart began to beat. Finally! It was he! Her friend! She 
jumped up and ran to meet him. 

Perhaps he would have managed to appear more cheerful as he 
approached the bench, but taken unawares, much sooner than he had 
expected to show her his face, he was caught with a gloomy expres- 
sion. 

“No luck?” 

“None, my friend.” 

“But it was almost certain? Why no luck? How could it be, my 
friend?” 


What Is to Be Done? 135 


“Let’s head toward home. I'll accompany you and we can chat. In a 
few moments I'll tell you why we had no luck. But for now let me 
think. I still haven’t gathered my thoughts. We need to come up with 
something new. Let’s not despair; we'll think up something.” With 
these last few words he was trying to cheer himself up, but not having 
much success. 

“Tell me at once. I can’t bear to wait. You say ‘come up with some- 
thing new.’ Does that mean everything we thought up before is use- 
less? Can't I become a governess? Oh, poor, unfortunate me!” 

“Why should I deceive you? No, you can't. I wanted to tell you. But 
have patience, my friend, have patience! Be strong. The strong will 
eventually succeed.” 

“I am strong, my friend, but it’s very difficult.” 

They walked on for several moments in silence. 

What's this? Yes, she has something under her coat. 

“My friend, you're carrying something. Give it to me and I'll carry it 
for you.” 

“No, there’s no need. It isn’t heavy. Never mind.” 

They continue on again in silence. They walk for a long time. 

“I was so excited that I couldn't get to sleep until two o’clock this 
morning. And when I did, I had such a wonderful dream! I dreamed 
that I was being liberated from a stuffy cellar, that 'd been paralyzed 
and was cured, and then I ran out into a field with many other girls 
who'd also been freed from cellars and cured of their paralysis. It was 
so much fun torun around in that spacious field. But my dream hasn't 
come true. I thought I wouldn't be returning home.” 

“My friend, give me your bundle, I'll carry it for you, since it’s no 
longer a secret.” 

Once again they continue on in silence. Thus they walk for a long 
time. 

“My friend, do you know what I’ve concluded as a result of the 
discussion with that lady? You can’t leave home without Marya Alek- 
sevna’s permission. You can’t. No. Here, let me take your arm. I’m 
worried about you.” 

“No, it’s nothing. It’s just a little hard to breathe under this veil.” 

She throws off the veil. “Now that’s better. I'm all right.” 

(“How pale she is!”) “No, my friend, don’t think about what I just 
said. I didn’t mean it. We'll manage somehow.” 

“How will we, my friend? You're saying that just to console me. 
There's nothing we can possibly do.” 

He remains silent. Once again they walk on in silence. 

(“How pale! How very pale!”) “My friend, there is one way.” 

“What's that, my dear?” 


136 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


‘T shall tell you, my friend, but only after you've calmed down a little. 
We must discuss it dispassionately.” 

“Tell me immediately. I won't calm down until you do.” 

“No, you're too agitated, my friend. You can't make important deci- 
sions now. In a little while. Soon. Here's the entrance. Good-bye, my 
friend. As soon as I see that you're able to reply dispassionately, I'll tell 
you.” 

“When will that be?” 

“The day after tomorrow at my lesson.” 

“That's too long to wait.” 

“T'll come tomorrow on purpose.” 

“No, sooner.” 

“Tonight.” 

“No, I won't let you go. Come in with me now. You say I'm upset and 
I can't reason. All right. Have dinner with us. You'll see how calm I can 
be. After dinner mama will take a nap and then we can talk.” 

“But how can I just walk in with you? If we enter together, your 
mother will get suspicious again.” 

“Suspicious! What do I care? No, my friend. In fact, it would be better 
if you come in. I had my veil raised and someone could have seen us.” 

“You're right.” 


XV. 


Marya Aleksevna was very surprised indeed to see her daughter and 
Lopukhov come in together. She set about examining them with ut- 
most scrutiny. 

“I dropped in on you, Marya Aleksevna, to say that since I'll be busy 
the day after tomorrow I'll come for the lesson tomorrow instead. Let 
me sit down. I'm very tired and upset. I'd like to have a little rest.” 

“What on earth is the matter with you, Dmitry Sergeich? You look 
awfully gloomy.” 

“Are they returning from an amorous rendezvous, or did they just 
happen to meet by chance?” Marya Aleksevna wondered. “If it were 
the former, shouldn't he be more cheerful? If they'd had a lovers’ 
quarrel because she wouldn't agree to his desires, then he'd certainly 
be angry; but in that case he’d never have escorted her home. And 
once more she went straight to her room and didn't even look at him: 
no sign of a quarrel. No, it looks as if they just met by chance. On the 
other hand ... the devil knows what they're up to. One has to be 
vigilant.” 


What Is to Be Done? 137 


“There's nothing wrong, Marya Aleksevna, but Vera Pavlovna looks a 
bit pale, at least it seems so to me.” 

“Verochka? It happens occasionally.” 

“Perhaps it just seems so to me. I confess that my head is spinning 
from so many ideas.” 

“What is it, Dmitry Sergeich? Have you had some kind of disagree- 
ment with your fiancée?” 

“No, Marya Aleksevna. I’m pleased with my fiancée. But I'd like to 
quarrel with my parents.” 

“What are you saying, my dear fellow! Dmitry Sergeich, how can you 
quarrel with your parents? I'd never have thought it of you, my dear 
boy.” 

“It’s an impossible situation, Marya Aleksevna. It’s that kind of fam- 
ily. They demand God knows what from a man, more than he can ever 
do.” 

“That's a different story, Dmitry Sergeich. You can't please everyone; 
one must know one’s limits, that’s for sure. If that’s what it is, a quarrel 
about money, then I certainly can't blame you.” 

“Forgive me if I'm rude, Marya Aleksevna. I’m so upset that I need to 
have some rest among pleasant and well-respected company. I can't 
find that kind of company anywhere except in your house. Permit me 
to invite myself to dinner with you today. Let me send Matryona out to 
make a few special purchases. I think that Denker’s Wineshop isn't far 
from here; he doesn't stock the very best wines, but it will do.”51 

Marya Aleksevna became furious at the first mention of his staying 
to dinner, but when he mentioned Matryona, she managed to stifle 
her fury and her face assumed an expectant expression: “Let's just see, 
my fine friend, what you'll contribute to the dinner. From Denker’s— 
well now, it ought to be something good!” But her fine friend, who 
wasn't looking at her expression, had already taken out his cigar case, 
torn off a corner of a long-lost letter, taken out a pencil, and was now 
writing something down. 

“If I may be so bold as to inquire, Marya Aleksevna, what kind of 
wine do you prefer?” 

“My dear Dmitry Sergeich, I must confess that I know nothing about 
wines and hardly ever drink them. It’s not a woman's affair.” 

“Oh, sure,” thought Lopukhov, “from the first glance one could tell 
from your face that you don't drink.” 

“Of course not, Marya Aleksevna. But even young ladies can drink 
maraschino liqueur. Will you allow me to order some?” 


51. Denker, a prominent Petersburg vintner, owned several shops throughout the 


city. 


138 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“What's that, Dmitry Sergeich?” 

“It’s hardly a wine at all. It’s more like a sweet syrup.” He took out a 
ten-ruble note. “I think that'll be enough.” He glanced over his list. 
“Just in case, here’s another five rubles.” 

Three weeks’ earnings, his allowance for a whole month! But he had 
no choice: he needed a large bribe for Marya Aleksevna. 

Marya Aleksevna’s eyes became moist and the sweetest smile imag- 
inable took full possession of her face. 

“Is there a confectionery nearby? I don’t know if they sell any walnut 
cake, the best as far as my taste goes, Marya Aleksevna. But if they 
don’t, we'll take whatever they have. Please don’t be offended.” 

He went out to the kitchen and sent Matryona off to make the 
purchases. 

“Let's splurge today, Marya Aleksevna. I want to toast the quarrel 
with my parents. Why not go on a binge, Marya Aleksevna? Things 
couldn't be better with my fiancée. And once that’s in the bag, we'll 
really start living! Am I right, Marya Aleksevna?” 

“Right you are, my dear Dmitry Sergeich. But what’s this I see? 
You're throwing a lot of money around! I wouldn't have expected it 
from such a reasonable man. Could it be you've received an advance 
from your fiancée, or what?” 

“No, I haven't, Marya Aleksevna, but if I've got some money, then we 
can splurge. What kind of advance? That’s not the point! You can't 
make do on advances! Business must be conducted on the up and up, 
or else you'll arouse suspicion. And it’s dishonorable, Marya Aleksev- 
na.” 

“Dishonorable, Dmitry Sergeich. Dishonorable, indeed. In my opin- 
ion honor must always be maintained.” 

“Right you are, Marya Aleksevna.” 

During the half hour or three-quarters of an hour remaining until 
dinner the conversation continued in a most amicable way about 
various honorable subjects. Dmitry Sergeich, incidentally, declared in 
a burst of candor that the date of his wedding was fast approaching. 
What about Vera Pavlovna’s marriage? Marya Aleksevna couldn't say 
much, since she wasn't putting any pressure on her daughter. Of 
course not. But in his estimation Vera Pavlovna would soon agree to 
marry. She hadn't actually said anything to him, but he had eyes to 
see. “You and I, Marya Aleksevna, we're old birds, and as they say, old 
birds can’t be caught with chaff. I may still be young, but I too am an 
old bird, an old hand. Isn't that right, Marya Aleksevna?” 

“Yes indeed, my boy, an old hand!” 

In short, this pleasant heart-to-heart with Marya Aleksevna so re- 
vived Dmitry Sergeich that his grief entirely disappeared. He was more 


What Is to Be Done? 139 


cheerful than Marya Aleksevna had ever seen him. “That sly rogue! 
That rascal! He’s already snitched over a thousand rubles from his 
fiancée; his parents have found out that he’s lined his pockets and 
now they've begun to pester him. And he says, ‘No, dear mama and 
papa, as a dutiful son, I’m prepared to respect you, but I have no 
money for you.’ What a scoundrel! It’s very pleasant to chat with such 
a fellow, especially when, after hearing Matryona’s return, you run into 
the kitchen pretending that you're going to the bedroom to fetch a 
handkerchief, and you see that the wine cost twelve rubles fifty ko- 
pecks, and that we'll only drink a third of it at dinner, and that the 
confectioner’s cake cost one ruble fifty kopecks—and that, it’s safe to 
say, is money thrown away—on a cake! Still, there'll be some left over, 
and I can serve it to my old cronies instead of preserves—and not only 
not suffer any loss, but actually save money.” 


XVi. 


Verochka is sitting in her room. 

“Did I do the right thing in making him come in? Mama looked at us 
so intently. 

“And what an awkward position I’ve put him in! How can he stay to 
dinner? 

“My God, what will ever become of poor me? 

““There's one way,’ he says. No, my dear, there isn’t any. 

“Yes, there is one. There it is: the window. When things become too 
difficult, I shall throw myself out of it. 

“How ridiculous! ‘When things become too difficult.’ What about 
now? 

“When you do throw yourself out a window, how fast you travel! It’s 

as if youre flying instead of falling. It must be very nice. But then you 
hit the sidewalk—how hard it is! Is it painful? No, I doubt there's time 
enough to feel the pain. Still it's very hard. But that’s for one brief 
moment; on the other hand, before that moment, there's the air—soft 
as a featherbed—and it parts so easily and gently. . . . Yes, that’s love- 
ly.... 
“And then what? Everyone will stare—the skull’s split open, the face 
is smashed, bloodied, and muddied. . . . No, if only you could spread 
some clean sand on the spot beforehand—but even the sand here is 
dirty. ... No, I mean some of the cleanest, whitest sand: now that 
would be nice! Then your face wouldn't be so smashed. It would stay 
clean and wouldn't frighten anyone. 

“In Paris the poor, unfortunate girls poison themselves with char- 


140 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


coal fumes. That’s a good way, a very good way. Not like throwing 
yourself out the window. 

“They're talking so loudly. What are they saying? No, I can’t make it 
out. 

“And I would leave him a note telling him everything. I told him 
then, ‘This is my birthday.’ How bold I was that day! How could I have 
been so bold? I was so foolish and didn’t understand a thing. 

“Yes, those poor girls in Paris are very clever. So why can't I be clever, 
too? How amusing it would be. They’ll enter my room and won't be 
able to see anything. It'll be full of fumes and the air will be green. 
They'll get frightened. What on earth? Where’s Verochka? Mama will 
shout at papa, ‘Why are you standing there? Break open the window! 
They will and then they'll see me. I'll be sitting at my dressing table, 
my head slumped forward and my face covered by my hands. ‘Ver- 
ochka, are you overcome with fumes?’ I'll make no reply. ‘Verochka, 
why don't you say something?’ ‘Oh, she has suffocated! They'll start to 
scream and cry. How amusing it will be when they start to cry, and 
mama will say how much she loved me. 

“Yes, but he'll feel sorry for me. Well, I'll leave him a note. 

“Yes, I'll consider that and maybe I'll do just what those poor girls in 
Paris do. Once I say it, I'll do it. I’m not afraid. 

“What is there to be afraid of? It'll be so nice! But I'll wait a bit to find 
out what this ‘one way’ is that he’s talking about. No, there isn’t any 
way. He only said that to calm me down. 

“Why do people try to do that? It really isn’t necessary! Can you ever 
comfort someone when there’s no way to help? Even though he’s 
smart, he tried, too. Why? It’s so unnecessary. 

“Why is he talking like that? It’s as though he were cheerful! He 
sounds cheerful! 

“Can he really have come up with another way? 

“No, there isn’t any. 

“But if he hasn't, then why does he sound so cheerful? 

“What has he come up with?” 


Xvii. 


“Verochka, come to dinner!” called Marya Aleksevna. 

In fact, Pavel Konstantinych had returned and the pie had been 
ready for some time—not the one from the confectioner’s, but Ma- 
tryona’s own homemade pie with meat filling left over from yester- 
day’s soup. 

“Marya Aleksevna, have you ever tried a glass of vodka before din- 
ner? It’s good for you, especially this kind here, flavored with the rind 


What Is to Be Done? 141 


of bitter oranges.5? I’m speaking as a doctor. Please, try some. No, no, 
you must. As a doctor I'm prescribing that you try some.” 

“Well, since one should always follow a doctor's orders—but only 
half a glass.” 

“No, Marya Aleksevna, half a glass won't do you any good.” 

“What about you, Dmitry Sergeich?” 

“I've grown old and settled down, Marya Aleksevna. I've taken the 
pledge.” 

“My word, it certainly warms me up!” 

“That's why it’s good for you, Marya Aleksevna.” 

(“How very cheerful he is! Could there really and truly be a way? And 
since when has he become so friendly with her? Why won't that sly 
fellow even look at me?”) 

They sat down to dinner. 

“And now Pavel Konstantinych and I will try some ale. It’s just like 
beer, no more, no less. Try some, Marya Aleksevna.” 

“If you say it’s like beer, I’ll try it. Why shouldn't I drink some beer?” 

(“Good Lord, so many bottles! How foolish I am! That’s what this 
‘friendship’ is all about!”) 

(“What a scoundrel he is! He’s not drinking. He merely sipped his 
ale. It’s good stuff, this ale. It smells a bit like kvass®3 and it has a kick. 
Yes, quite a kick. As soonas I marry her off to that Misha Storeshnikov, 
I’m going to give up vodka and switch to ale. This fellow will never 
drink himself into a stupor! At least sip some, you rascal! Well, so 
much the better for me. But I bet if he really wanted to, he could drink 
like a fish.”) 

“You really ought to drink something, Dmitry Sergeich.” 

“I've drunk quite a bit in my time, Marya Aleksevna. I've built up a 
reserve that'll last for a good long while. When I had neither work nor 
money, I drank; when I have both work and money, I don't need to. I 
feel good even without it.” 

The entire dinner continued in this same way. The confectioner’s 
pie was served. 

“Dear Matryona Stepanovna, what will we drink with dessert?” 

“Right away, Dmitry Sergeich, right away.” Matryona returns carry- 
ing a bottle of champagne. 

“Vera Pavlovna, you haven't drunk anything and neither have I. Now 
let's both drink. To my fiancée and to your suitor!” 

“What's this?” thinks Verochka. “Is that it?” 


52. Russians often flavor their vodka with a variety of fruits, herbs, and grasses, both 
for allegedly medicinal purposes and to provide an assortment of tastes to complement 
foods served before meals. 

53. A popular fermented drink made from fruits, vegetables, or, most commonly, 
black bread. 


142 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“May God grant happiness to your fiancée and to Verochka’s suitor,” 
says Marya Aleksevna. “And may He allow us old folks to see Verochka 
married soon.” 

“Don’t worry, you'll see it very soon, Marya Aleksevna. Right, Vera 
Pavlovna? Right!” 

“Could it be he really means it?” wonders Verochka. 

“Yes, Vera Pavlovna, of course it is. Just say yes.” 

“Yes,” says Verochka. 

“There now, Vera Pavlovna, you've been worrying your mother for 
nothing. ‘Yes,’ you said, and that’s that. So now we'll drink another 
toast. To Vera Pavlovna’s wedding—the sooner, the better! Drink up, 
Vera Pavlovna! Don't worry, it'll all be all right. Let’s clink our glasses. 
To your wedding day!” 

They clink. 

“God willing, God willing! Thank you, Verochka, you're a great com- 
fort to me in my old age!” says Marya Aleksevna, wiping away her tears. 
The English ale and the maraschino liqueur have put her in a senti- 
mental mood. 

“God willing, God willing,” repeats Pavel Konstantinych. 

“How pleased we all are with you, Dmitry Sergeich,” says Marya 
Aleksevna at the end of dinner. “Howvery pleased. You've treated us to 
a feast in our own house. You've made it a holiday!” By now her eyes 
are more mellow than bright. 

Not every crafty scheme turns out as well as this one. Lopukhov had 
not counted on this result when he bought the wine. He’d merely 
intended to bribe Marya Aleksevna in order to remain in her good 
graces after having invited himself to dinner. Would she really get 
drunk in the presence of an outsider? Even though she had consider- 
able regard for him, she still didn’t trust him entirely—after all, whom 
could she trust? And she herself had never expected that matters 
would progress so rapidly. She’d planned to postpone the main treat 
until after tea. But the flesh is weak. She could have withstood the 
vodka and any familiar beverage, but the ale and other delicacies 
proved too great a temptation for her inexperience. 

Dinner turned out to be a festive occasion, worthy of a nobleman; 
therefore Marya Aleksevna told Matryona to fetch the samovar, as 
befits such a splendid repast. But she and Lopukhov were the only 
ones to partake of this gentility. Verochka said that she didn’t want any 
tea and went to her room. Pavel Konstantinych, a most uncultured 
man, went to lie down as usual, right after the last course. Dmitry 
Sergeich drank slowly; after finishing one cup, he requested another. 
At this point Marya Aleksevna gave out; she excused herself by saying 
that she’d been feeling badly ever since that morning. The guest 


What Is to Be Done? 143 


begged her not to stand on ceremony and he was soon left there all 
alone. Lopukhov drank a second cup, followed by a third, and then 
dozed in the armchair—dead drunk, in Matryona’s judgment, just like 
her own treasure, Marya Aleksevna. Meanwhile, her own treasure was 
snoring away; it must have been this snoring that awoke Dmitry Ser- 
geich after Matryona had cleared away the samovar, the cups, and 
herself into the kitchen.

“Forgive me, Vera Pavlovna,” said Lopukhov upon entering her 
room. He spoke very softly and his voice was shaking now, although 
he'd been shouting during dinner. He also said “Vera Pavlovna” in- 
stead of “my friend.” “Forgive my impertinence. You must understand 
what I was saying: a husband and wife cannot be separated. You will 
be free.” 

“My dear. You saw that I was crying when you came in.54 Those 
were tears of joy.” 

Lopukhov kissed her hand, many times. 

“So, my dear, you are liberating me from this cellar. How kind and 
clever you are! How on earth did you think of it?” 

“I thought of it that evening while we were dancing together.” 

“My dear, even then I thought you were a kind man. You are liberat- 
ing me, my dear. I'm prepared to be patient, now that I know I'll be 
leaving this cellar. It won't be so stuffy in here anymore. How will I be 
leaving it, my dear?” 

“Here's how, Verochka. It’s now almost the end of April. My work at 
the Academy will be done by the beginning of July. I must finish so I 
can earn enough for us to live on. Then you'll leave this cellar. You 
need only endure another three months, even less. You will leave. I'll 
become a doctor. The salary isn’t large, but it will do. I'll start a private 
practice, as large as it needs to be, and welll be able to live.” 

“Oh, my dear, we'll need very, very little. But there is one thing: I 
don’t want to live on your money. Why, even now I'm giving lessons. I 
shall lose them as soon as mama tells everyone that I'm the villain. But 
I shall find other lessons. I'll be able to live. Isn't that right? I shouldn't 
be living on your money, should I?” 

“Who told you that, my dear friend Verochka?” 


54. Vera and Lopukhov have switched to the familiar ty from the more formal vy. Like 
French and German, Russian contains two forms of the pronoun “you,” one indicative of 
politeness or formality between equals or deference to a superior, the other of affection, 
condescension, or authority. 


144 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Oh, he still asks who told me! Weren't you the one who was always 
going on about it? And what about all your books? A good half of each 
one is devoted to this question.” 

“All my books? My going on about it? But when, Verochka?” 

“When? Who was it who said that everything is based on money? 
Who was it, Dmitry Sergeich?” 

“Well, what of it?” 

“Do you think I’m such a silly little baby that I can't draw a conclu- 
sion based on premises, as your books would say?” 

“But what conclusion? God knows what you're going on about, my 
dear friend Verochka.” 

“Oh, you sly one! You do want to be a despot! You want me to be 
your slave.55 No, sir. That will never be, Dmitry Sergeich. Do you under- 
stand?” 

“You explain it and I’m sure to understand.” 

“You said, Dmitry Sergeich, that everything is based on money. Your 
books said that the person who has money has both power and rights. 
That means that as long as a woman is living at a man's expense, she’s 
in a state of dependence. Isn’t that correct, Dmitry Sergeich? You 
assumed that I didn’t understand and would be your slave. No, Dmitry 
Sergeich, I won't allow you to be a tyrant over me. You would try to be 
a kind, beneficent despot, but I don't want even that, Dmitry Sergeich. 
So, my dearest, how shall we live? You will cut up people’s arms and 
legs, feed them vile potions, and I will give piano lessons. How else 
shall we arrange our life?” 

“Well, well, Verochka. Each of us will guard his own independence 
as much as he can from the other, no matter how much he loves the 
other, no matter how much he trusts the other. I don’t know whether 
or not you'll succeed in doing what you say, but that really doesn't 
matter. Once a person has resolved to do it, that’s really enough pro- 
tection from the other. He feels that he can get along on his own, that 
he can refuse support if he has to, and that feeling alone is almost 
enough. But what funny people we are, Verochka! You say you don't 
want to live at my expense and I praise you for saying it. Who else says 
such things, Verochka?” 

“Amusing, very amusing, my dear. But what of it? We'll live as we 
choose, as best suits us. How else shall we arrange our life, my dear?” 

“Vera Pavlovna, I've alreedy expressed my thoughts about one as- 
pect of our life which you were kind enough to reject totally with your 
own plan, calling me a tyrant and a slavemaster. Be so kind as to devise 


55. The image of woman as slave appears once again in Vera's fourth dream (see 
below, pp. 359-79). 


What Is to Be Done? 145 


your own arrangements for other aspects of our relationship. I con- 
sider it futile to make any other suggestions, and then have you de- 
stroy them in the same way. Verochka, my friend, tell me yourself how 
you plan to live; no doubt the only thing left then for me to say will be 
‘How cleverly you've thought it all out, my dear!” 

“What's this? You deign to pay me compliments? You desire to be 
courteous? I know all too well that flattery serves to disguise domina- 
tion as humility. I ask you to speak more directly in the future. You 
praise me to excess, my dear. I'm embarrassed. No, don’t praise me or 
I'll become too arrogant.” 

“All right, Vera Pavlovna, I'll begin to be rude to you, if that’s more to 
your liking. There's so little femininity in your nature that you'll proba- 
bly devise schemes that are thoroughly masculine.” 

“Tell me, my dear, what does this ‘femininity’ entail? I realize that a 
woman's voice is contralto, and a man’s is baritone. What follows from 
that? Is it really worth discussing just so that we stay contraltos? Is it 
really worth entreating us? Why is everyone trying to persuade us to 
remain feminine? Isn't that absurd, my dear?” 

“Yes, indeed, Verochka, and crude*®6 as well.” 

“Well, my dear, I for one shall not worry about femininity. With your 
permission, Dmitry Sergeich, I'll express thoroughly masculine ideas 
about how we are to arrange our life. We will be friends. But I want to 
be your best friend. I have yet to say how I despise your dear Kirsa- 
nov!” 

“You shouldn't, Verochka. He's a fine person.” 

“I detest him. I shall forbid you to see him.” 

“A splendid beginning. You're so frightened of my despotism that 
you want to make your husband into a puppet. How, pray tell, can I 
stop seeing him when were sharing our living quarters?” 

“Yes, and undoubtedly you're always in each other's arms.” 

“Naturally. At teatime and at dinner. Only our hands are so busy, it’s 
rather difficult to embrace.” 

“And you're inseparable for days on end.” 

“No doubt. I in my room, he in his. Is that almost inseparable?” 

“Well, if that’s the case, why can't you stop seeing him altogether?” 

“Because we're friends. Sometimes we feel like talking, and we do so 
as long as it’s no burden to the other.” 

“You sit together, embrace and quarrel, quarrel and embrace. I de- 
test him.” 


56. Suggesting both vulgarity and banality, the Russian word poshlost'’ is difficult to 
translate precisely. Essentially it expresses the intellectual's disdain for the philistine 
values and false pride imputed to the petty bourgeoisie. “Self-satisfied mediocrity” or 
“unjustified self-satisfaction” comes closest to the Russian meaning. 


146 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“What on earth are you saying, Verochka? We have never quarreled. 
We live almost separately. We're friends, that’s true. But what of it?” 

“So, my dear, I’ve fooled you! I've really fooled you! You didn’t want 
to tell me how we would arrange our life together, but you've told me 
everything. How I've fooled you! Listen now and I'll tell you how we'll 
live, according to your own account. First, we'll have two rooms, one 
for you and one for me, as well as a third room where we'll have tea 
and dinner, and receive those guests who come to see both of us, not 
you or me exclusively. Second, I'll never dare to enter your room so as 
not to pester you: Kirsanov doesn’t either, and that’s why you never 
quarrel. Nor will you enter my room. That’s the second point. Now for 
the third. Oh, dear, I forgot to ask you about this one. Does Kirsanov 
interfere in your affairs or you in his? Do you have the right to question 
each other about anything?” 

“Oh, now I know why you're so interested in Kirsanov! I won't an- 
swer.” 

“No, I detest him in any case. And don't say it: there’s no need 
to. I know the answer. You have no right to question each other about 
anything. And so, third: I won't have the right to question you about 
anything, my dear. If you want to or have to tell me something 
about your affairs, then you'll tell me yourself. And the opposite is also 
true. These are our three rules. What else?” 

“Verochka, the second point demands explanation. We'll see each 
other in the neutral room for tea and dinner.” But imagine the follow- 
ing circumstance. We drank our tea together in the morning and now 
I’m sitting in my own room, not daring to poke my nose into yours. 
That means that I won’t see you until dinner, correct?” 

“Of course.” 

“Fine. Let’s say that an acquaintance drops by and tells me that 
another friend of mine will be coming over at two o'clock. But I have to 
go out on business at one. May I request that you convey the necessary 
message to the friend who'll be coming at two o’clock? May I ask you 
to do that if you plan to be at home?” 

“Of course you may. Whether or not I agree to do it is another 
matter. If I refuse, you can’t object, nor can you seek an explanation. 
But you may certainly ask whether I’m willing to provide assistance. 
That you may do.” 

“Good. But I didn’t know all that at teatime, and I'm not allowed to 
enter your room. How then will I make my request?” 


57. Chernyshevsky established similar living arrangements with his own wife, Olga 
Sokratovna, apparently in accordance with wishes she expressed before their marriage. 
The relationship between Vera and Lopukhov also recalls the practices of some early 
Christian sects. 


What Is to Be Done? 147 


“Oh, Lord, how simple-minded you are, like a little child! What sort 
of dilemma is it, please tell me! Here’s exactly what you should do, 
Dmitry Sergeich. You go into the neutral room and say, ‘Vera Pavlovna!’ 
I answeryou from my own room, ‘Yes, Dmitry Sergeich, what is it?’ You 
say, ‘I’m going out. I expect that a Mr. A.’ (you insert the name of your 
friend) ‘will be coming by to see me. I have a message I'd like to give 
him. May I request, Vera Pavlovna, that you deliver the message?’ If I 
say no, our conversation is ended. If I say yes, I'll come into the neutral 
room and you'll tell me what the message is that I should convey to 
your friend. Now, you little child, do you know what you must do?” 

“Yes, dear Verochka. But all joking aside, what you describe really is 
the best way to arrange our life. But where did you come up with these 
ideas? I recognize them, and I even remember where I read them.58 
But you couldn't have seen any of those books and there were no such 
details in the ones I lent you. Did you hear them from someone? From 
whom? Surely I'm the first decent person you've ever met?” 

“My dear, is it really all that hard to arrive at these ideas indepen- 
dently? I have observed family life. I’m not talking about my own, 
which is so unusual. But I do have friends and I've been in their 
homes. My God, you can’t imagine how much unpleasantness I've 
seen between husbands and wives, my dear!” 

“Well, Verochka, I can imagine it.” 

“Do you know what I think, my dear? People ought not to live the 
way they do—all together, under one roof. They should see each other 
only on business or when they get together to relax and have a good 
time. I frequently observe and wonder why were so polite to strangers. 
Why do we always try to behave better when a stranger is present than 
in our own families? People do behave better among strangers. Why is 
that so? Why do we feel worse with our nearest and dearest, those 
whom we love? Do you know what Id like you to do, my dear? Please 
continue to treat me from now on as you've done up to now. This 
hasn't kept you from loving me, nor has it interfered with our being 
best friends. How have you behaved up to now? Have you ever an- 
swered me rudely or reprimanded me? No. People say that you can’t 
be rude to a strange woman or girl, that you can’t reprimand her. All 
right, my dear. Now I am your betrothed and soon I'll become your 
wife. Nevertheless, you'll treat me just as you’re supposed to treat a 
stranger. My friend, I think that will be the best way of ensuring our 
lasting harmony and abiding love. Isn't that right, dear?” 

“I don’t know what to make of you, Verochka, although you've cer- 
tainly surprised me before this.”

general (see n. 30 above). 


148 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“You wish to flatter me, dear. No, my friend, it’s not as difficult to 
understand as you think. I’m not the only one to have these ideas. 
Theyre shared by many girls and young women as innocent as I. But 
they can’t tell their suitors or their husbands what they think. They 
know that if they did, they’d be considered immoral. But I fell in love 
with you, my dear, because you didn’t think that. Do you know when I 
fell in love with you? It was that first time we talked on my birthday. 
When you said that women are poor creatures and deserve to be 
pitied—that’s when I fell in love with you.” 

“And when did I fall in love with you? You know already that it was 
on the same day, but when exactly?” 

“How amusing you are, my dear. The way you say it, it’s impossible 
not to guess the answer. And as soon as I do, you'll begin to flatter me 
again.” 

“Still, hazard a guess.” 

“Well, it's obvious. When I asked you if it really was possible to 
arrange things so that people would be happy.” 

“For that, Verochka, I must kiss your hand again.” 

“Enough, my dear, I don’t like it when men kiss women’s hands.” 

“Why not, Verochka?” 

“You know the answer to that, my dear. Why ask me? Don't ask such 
things.” 

“Yes, my friend, it’s true. I shouldn't ask such things. It’s foolish. I'll 
ask you only when I really don’t know what you mean. As for now, you 
wanted to say that no one should have his or her hand kissed.” 

Verochka started laughing. 

“Now I forgive you because I've managed to have a laugh at your 
expense. You see, you wanted to test me, but you yourself didn't know 
why it was wrong. No one should have his or her hand kissed—that’s 
true, but I wasn’t talking about that situation in general. I was only 
talking about the practice of men kissing women’s hands. My dear, 
that should be very embarrassing for women. It means that they aren't 
considered as equals to men; it means that a man can't lower his 
dignity before a woman, that she’s so much lower that however much 
he degrades himself before her, he’s still not her equal, but much 
higher than she is. But if you don’t think that, my dear, why should 
you kiss my hand? Listen. Do you know what just occurred to me, my 
dear? We aren't behaving very much like an engaged couple.” 

“Yes, that’s true, Verochka, we aren't. But then, what are we?” 

“Lord knows, my dear. Here's the thing: it’s as if we've already been 
married for a long, long time.” 

“Yes, indeed, my friend. That’s the truth. We're old friends and noth- 
ing’s changed.” 


What Is to Be Done? 149 


“Only one thing has changed, my dear. I now know that I’m leaving 
this cellar and I’m going to be free.” 


xix. 


Thus they chatted: a somewhat unusual first conversation between 
fiancés. They shook hands and when Lopukhov went home, it was 
Verochka who locked the door behind him, since Matryona was sitting 
in a tavern, relying on the fact that her “treasure” would still be snor- 
ing away for a long time to come. And indeed, her treasure did just 
that. 

After returning home around seven o’clock, Lopukhov wanted to get 
down to work, but he couldn't. His mind was preoccupied; he was still 
thinking about what had preoccupied him all the way from the Sem- 
yonovsky Bridge to the Vyborg district. Amorous fantasies, of course. 
Yes, indeed, only they weren't quite amorous and not quite fantasies. 
The life of a man who possesses only limited means has its prosaic 
aspects, and it was on them that Lopukhov was dwelling. What else? A 
materialist thinks exclusively about advantage, and indeed he was 
considering only that. Instead of lofty poetic and sublime visions, he 
was concerned with the sort of amorous fantasies appropriate to a 
crude materialist. 

“Sacrifice. It seems to be almost impossible to drive that idea out of 
her head. That’s bad. If you think that you're obligated to another 
person for something special, then relations with that person are al- 
ready somewhat strained. She's sure to find out. My friends will tell 
her what an admirable career I had awaiting me. Even if they don't, 
she'll figure it out by herself. ‘So, my friend, it was for me that you gave 
up your career. Well, we can assume that it won't be the money. 
Neither my friends nor she will hold that one against me. So I must be 
grateful that she won't think, ‘It was for me that he remained im- 
poverished; without me he could have been rich.’ They won’t think 
that! But she'll find out that I wanted a scholarly reputation and that I 
could have achieved one. That will distress her. ‘Oh, what a sacrifice 
he made for me!’ But I hadn’t been planning to make sacrifices. I 
haven't been foolish enough to make any so far, and I hope I never will. 
I did what was best for me. I’m not the sort of person who makes 
sacrifices. No one is. It’s a fallacious concept. Sacrifice is all stuff and 
nonsense.5? One does what's most pleasurable. But go and try to ex- 


59. “Zhertva—sapogi vsmyatku" (lit., “sacrifice is half-baked boots"), a colloquial ex- 
pression borrowed from Gogol's Dead Souls, vol. 1, chap. 9. 


150 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


plain that to her! It’s theoretically comprehensible, but as soon as a 
person is confronted with the facts, he becomes emotional. ‘You,’ he 
says, ‘you are my benefactor.’ Hasn't the bud of this future blossom 
already appeared? ‘You,’ she says, ‘you've released me from the cellar. 
You're so good to me.’ What need was there for me to release you if the 
idea hadn’t appealed to me? Do you think I'm releasing you? Forget it! 
Do you think I would have taken the trouble if it didn’t give me plea- 
sure as well? Perhaps I released myself! Yes, absolutely, myself! I want 
to live and love, do you understand? I’m doing it all for myself. How 
can I rid her of that pernicious feeling of gratitude that will burden 
her? I'll manage it somehow. She's a clever girl. She'll understand that 
it's pure nonsense. Of course, this isn’t at all what I had intended. I 
thought that if she managed to escape from that household, we could 
postpone marriage for two years or so. During that time I'd have be- 
come a-professor and my financial position would have been satisfac- 
tory. But a delay proved to be impossible. Well, what losses have I 
incurred? Was I thinking about myself when I decided to arrange my 
financial affairs first? What does that mean to a man? Nothing! It’s a 
woman who feels the lack of money. I have a pair of boots; my coat is 
not worn through at the elbows; I have a bowl of cabbage soup; my 
room is warm—what the hell more do I need? That much I'll always 
have. So then, what losses have I incurred? But it’s not enough for an 
attractive young woman! She needs to have pleasures and success in 
society. But she won’t have enough money for that. Of course, she 
won't think she’ll miss it. She’s a clever girl and honest. She'll think to 
herself, ‘That's all trifles, rubbish I despise’; and she will, too. But does 
it really help if a person doesn't realize what he lacks, or, if he does, he 
insists that he doesn’t need it at all? That's an illusion, a fantasy. 
Human nature is stifled by reason, circumstances, and pride. It keeps 
silent and doesn't make itself known to one’s consciousness, all 
the while silently doing its work of undermining life. A young girl 
shouldn't have to live like that; a beautiful woman shouldn't have to 
live like that. It’s not right if she’s dressed worse than others, if she 
lacks sparkle on account of her limited means. I pity you, poor dear. I 
thought things would somehow turn out a little better for you. But 
what about me? I'm the winner. It’s still uncertain whether she'd have 
married me two years from now, but now she will. . . .” 

“Dmitry, come and have some tea.’ 

“Coming.” Lopukhov headed into Kirsanov’s room, but along the 
way he had more time to reflect. “It’s certainly true that one’s own ego 
comes first; that’s where it begins and ends. I started with the idea of 
sacrifice—what dishonesty! As if I were really giving up a scholarly 
reputation and a position in the department. What nonsense! What 


What Is to Be Done? 151 


difference will it make? I'll still be working, I'll still get a chair, and I'll 
still be serving medicine. It’s very amusing for the theorist to observe 
how egoism can play with one’s own ideas in practice.” 

Since I’m forewarning the reader about everything, I'll tell him not to 
assume that Lopukhov’s monologue contains any mysterious hint by 
the author concerning some important future development in rela- 
tions between Lopukhov and Vera Pavlovna. Her life will not be under- 
mined by an inability to sparkle in society or to dress elegantly, and 
her relations with Lopukhov will not be spoiled by any “pernicious 
feeling” of gratitude. I'm not the sort of author whose every word hides 
some kind of surprise. I describe what people thought and what they 
did, and that’s all. If some action, conversation, or internal monologue 
is needed to characterize a person or situation, then I'll relate it, even if 
it should prove to have no influence on the future course of my novel. 

“Now, Alexander, you won't be able to complain that I’m lagging 
behind you at work. Ill soon catch up.” 

“What, have you finished with your efforts on that girl’s behalf?” 

“T have.” 

“Will she become a governess at Madame B.'s?” 

“No, she won't. Things have turned out differently. She'll be able to 
lead a tolerable life in her own home for the time being.” 

“Well, that’s fine. It’s hard to be a governess. Meanwhile, I've finished 
with the optical nerve, my friend, and am about to start on the next 
pair. Where did you stop?” 

“I still have to finish up my work on .. .’ 

Here there followed all sorts of anatomical and physiological terms.

“It’s now the twenty-eighth of April. He said that matters would be 
arranged by the beginning of July; let's suppose the tenth, since that’s 
not the very beginning. I can use that date. Perhaps, just to be sure, I 
should take the fifteenth. No, the tenth is better. How many days are 
left? No need to count today, as there are only five hours left. There are 
two days remaining in April; thirty-one days in May plus those two is 
thirty-three; thirty days in June plus thirty-three is sixty-three; ten 
days in July. That makes seventy-three days in all. Is that all? Only 
seventy-three days? And then freedom! I shall escape from this cellar! 
How happy I am! My dearest, how clever it was of him to think of it! 
How very happy I am!” 


This was Sunday evening. On Monday there was a lesson, resched- 
uled from Tuesday. 


152 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“My friend, my dearest, how glad I am to be with you again, even for 
a moment. Do you know how much longer I have to stay in this cellar? 
Will your affairs be settled soon? By the tenth of July?” 

“They will, Verochka.” 

“Then I have to stay in this cellar only seventy-two more days, not 
counting this evening. I've already crossed out one day. I've made a 
calendar, just like schoolchildren do, and I'm crossing off the days. 
How wonderful it is to cross out days.” 

“My dearest, dearest Verochka. Yes, you won't have to languish here 
for long. The two and a half months will pass quickly and then you'll 
be free.” 

“How wonderful it will be! But, my dearest, you musn't talk to me or 
look at me any more, or play the piano each time you come. And I 
won't always come out of my room to see you. No, I won't be able to 
bear it! I will come out, but only for a minute, and I'll look at you in a 
cold and unfriendly way. Now I'll return to my room. Farewell, my 
dear. When will you return?” 

“On Thursday.” 

“Three days! So long! But then there'll only be sixty-eight more days 
left.” 

“Even fewer. It should be possible to get you out of here by the 
seventh.” 

“The seventh? So now there are only sixty-eight days left! How hap- 
py you've made me. Farewell, my dear!” 


Thursday. 

“My dear, I have only sixty-six more days here.” 

“Yes, Verochka, time passes quickly.” 

“Quickly? No, dear. The days have become so long. At any other time 
a whole month would have gone by, instead of only these last three 
days. Good-bye, my dear, we shouldn't talk for long. We are clever, 
aren't we? Good-bye. Still sixty-six days left to stay in this cellar!” 

(“Hmm, hmm. It’s natural that I didn’t notice. Time flies at my work. 
And I'm not the one in the cellar. Hmm, hmm. Yes.”) 


Saturday. 

“My dear, there are still sixty-four days left! What anguish! These two 
days were longer than the previous three. What anguish! What vile- 
ness, my dear, if you only knew. Good-bye, my sweet, till Tuesday. 
These next three days will be even longer than all the last five. Good- 
bye, my dear.” 

(“Hmm, hmm. Yes! Hmm! Her eyes look bad. She doesn't like to cry. 
It isn't good. Hmm. Yes.”) 


What Is to Be Done? 153 


Tuesday. 

“Oh, my dear, I've stopped counting the days. Theyre not passing 
quickly, not passing at all.” 

“Verochka, my dear, I have a favor to ask you. We need to have a long 
talk. You're so eager for your freedom. Give yourself some; we need to 
talk.” 

“We do, my dear, we really do.” 

“Then this is what I ask you. Tomorrow, whenever it’s most conven- 
ient, it doesn’t matter when, just tell me—you'll be on that same 
bench on Konnogvardeisky Boulevard. Will you come?” 

“IT will, my dear, I certainly will. At eleven o’clock—is that all right?” 

“Fine. Thank you, my dear.” 

“Good-bye, dearest. I'm so glad you thought of that. How is it that I 
was too silly to think of it? Good-bye. We will have a long talk. And I'll 
get a breath of freedom. Good-bye, my dearest. Tomorrow at eleven 
o'clock, without fail.” 


Friday. 

“Verochka, where are you going?” 

“Who, me, mama?” Verochka blushed. “To Nevsky Prospekt, mama.” 

“Good. I'll go along with you, Verochka. I have to go into the Shop- 
ping Arcade.©° What's this, Verochka? You say you're going to Nevsky 
and yet you've put on that dress? You should be better dressed to walk 
along Nevsky. People will see you.” 

“I like this dress. Wait a moment, mama, I need to get something 
from my room.” 

They set off, and now they're on their way. They've reached the 
Shopping Arcade and are walking along Sadovaya Street, not very far 
from the corner of Nevsky—close to Ruzanov’s shop.®! 

“Mama, I have two words to say to you.” 

“What is it, Verochka?” 

“Good-bye, mama. I don’t know when I'll see you again. If you don't 
get angry, then it will be tomorrow.” 

“What, Verochka? I don’t understand.” 

“Good-bye, mama. I’m going to join my husband. Dmitry Sergeich 
and I were married three days ago. Coachman, to Caravannaya [Cara- 
van) Street, please.” 

“Twenty-five kopecks, madame.” 

“Fine, let's get going. Mama, he'll drop in on you this evening. Don’t 
be angry at me, mama.”

These last words barely reached Marya Aleksevna’s ears. 

“Coachman, I'm not really going to Caravannaya Street. I only said 
that so you'd hurry and I could get away from that woman quickly. 
Turn left, along Nevsky. I’m going much farther than Caravannaya 
Street, all the way to Vasilievsky Island, the Fifth Line past Middle 
Prospekt. If you get me there quickly, I'll give you a good tip.” 

“So you tricked me, madame! That'll cost you fifty kopecks.” 

“If you drive quickly.”

The wedding arrangements were not very elaborate, nor were they 
entirely conventional. 

For two days or so after the conversation during which they became 
engaged, Verochka rejoiced over her imminent emancipation. By the 
third day her “cellar,” as she called it, seemed twice as unbearable as 
before. On the fourth day she began to cry, which she detested, but 
she didn’t cry for long. On the fifth day she cried for longer. On the 
sixth she no longer cried, but her anguish prevented her from sleep- 
ing. 

Lopukhov saw this and uttered his first monologue, “Hmm, hmm.” 
He looked again, and uttered his second “Hmm, hmm. Yes. Hmm.” In 
the first, he inferred something, but didn’t know exactly what it was. In 
the second he explained the inference to himself. “No, it won’t do— 
having shown her a glimpse of freedom, to leave her in confinement.” 
He thought about it for the next two hours: an hour and a half en route 
from the Semenovsky Bridge to the Vyborg district, and a half hour at 
home on his sofa. For the first quarter of an hour he thought without 
knitting his brows; for the remaining hour and three-quarters he knit- 
ted his brows. At the end of two hours he struck his forehead and 
exclaimed, “You meathead! You're worse than the Postmaster in Go- 
gol’s comedy.”®? He looked at his watch. “Ten o’clock—there’s still 
time.” He left his apartment. 

During the first quarter of an hour, when he wasn't knitting his 
brows, he was thinking, “It’s all nonsense! Why must I finish my 
course? I won't die if I don’t get a diploma. Who needs it? I can earn as 
much money, maybe even more, giving lessons and doing translations, 
as I can being a doctor. What nonsense!” 

In fact, to tell the truth, there was really no reason for him to knit his 

62. In Gogol's satirical comedy The Inspector-General (1836), the incompetence and 


naiveté of the bumbling postmaster Ivan Kuzmich Shpekin contribute greatly to the self- 
delusion and downfall of the town's mayor and other leading citizens. 


What Is to Be Done? 155 


brows. In part the problem turned out to be solvable because ever 
since his last lesson, he’d had a premonition of something akin to 
these reflections. Now he understood. If we were to remind him of his 
ruminations beginning with the subject of sacrifice and ending with 
the theme of woman’s elegance, we could accuse him of having had a 
premonition from then on of something of the sort, since there would 
be no other way of explaining the appearance of his idea, “I'll give up a 
scholarly career.” At that time it didn’t occur to him that he’d give it 
up, but his instinct was already saying, “You will, and without delay.” 
And if we accuse Lopukhov the pragmatist of specious logic in his 
answer, “I’m not giving up anything,” he would triumph as a theoreti- 
cian and would reply, “Here's another example of how egoism deter- 
mines both our thoughts (I should have seen it, but didn’t, because I 
wanted to see something else) and our actions. Why else did I force the 
girl to stay in her cellar for an extra week when I should have foreseen 
it and made all the necessary arrangements then!” 

But nothing of the sort occurred to him because he was forced to 
knit his brows and, having done so, he had to ponder for an hour and 
three-quarters the words “Who will marry us?” The reply was always 
the same: “No one will.” Suddenly, instead of this “no one,” the name 
Mertsalov popped into his head. It was then that he struck his fore- 
head and swore at himself for good reason. How was it that he didn’t 
think of Mertsalov right from the start? But perhaps that wasn’t such a 
good reason because it was strange indeed to think of Mertsalov as a 
person to marry them. 

In the Medical Academy there are a great many students of different 
kinds, among them seminarians.®* They have acquaintances in the 
Theological Academy; through them, so did Lopukhov. One of the 
students he knew in the Theological Academy, not an intimate but a 
close acquaintance, had finished his studies a year ago and was now a 
priest in some large building with endless corridors on Vasilievsky 
Island.® It was to see this person that Lopukhov now set off. Because 
of the extraordinary circumstances and the lateness of the hour, he 
even hired a cab. 


63. Some students were from the clerical estate and had attended an Orthodox 
seminary before entering a university or other institute of higher education. Cher- 
nyshevsky had been such a student. Before the mid-nineteenth century the sons of 
clergy normally pursued higher education only in theological academies. Hence tsarist 
universities and secular institutes of higher education were dominated by sons of the 
nobility, wealthy and poor alike. 

64. Probably a reference to the main building of the University of St. Petersburg, 
although it could also be either the Academy of Fine Arts or the elite Military Academy 
(Kadetsky Korpus). All three buildings are located on Vasilievsky Island, in the Neva 
estuary opposite the central part of St. Petersburg. 


156 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Mertsalov was at home alone reading some recent work, either by 
Louis XIV or by someone else of the same dynasty.® 

“So that’s all there is to it, Aleksei Petrovich. I understand that it 
entails a large risk for you. It'll all be all right if we make it up with her 
parents, but what if they press a lawsuit?&* Then there could be trou- 
ble for you, and there probably will be. But . . .” Lopukhov couldn't 
come up with a single “but.” How indeed can you persuade a person 
to place his head in a noose for your sake? 

Mertsalov thought about it for a long time, he too trying to come up 
with a “but” to authorize himself to run such a risk; but he couldn't 
come up with a single one either. 

“What can I do? I'd like to....A year ago I did exactly the same 
thing, but now I feel bound, as you soon will, too. It’s a shame! I should 
help you, but when you have a wife you're afraid to act take a chance.” 

“Hello, Alyosha,” said an attractive and lively young blonde, aged 
seventeen, who was just coming back from visiting her parents. “Re- 
gards from everyone. Hello, Lopukhov. We haven't seen you for some 
time. What's that you're saying about wives? You're always putting the 
blame on them!” 

Mertsalov apprised his wife of the facts. The young woman's eyes 
began to sparkle. 

“But Alyosha, they won't gobble you up!” 

“There's a risk, Natasha.” 

“A very great one,” Lopukhov confirmed. 

“Well, what's to be done? Take the risk, Alyosha. I beg you.” 

“If you won't accuse me of having forgotten all about you in facing 
this dangerous situation, Natasha, then it’s all settled. When do you 
want to be married, Dmitry Sergeich?” 

Consequently, there were no more obstacles remaining. 

On Monday morning Lopukhov said to Kirsanov, “Do you know 
what, Alexander? I'm thinking about turning over my share of our 
work to you. Take my papers and specimens. I'm giving it all up. I’m 
leaving the Academy. Here’s my resignation. I'm getting married.” 

Lopukhov related the story in brief. 

“If you or I were stupid, Dmitry, I'd tell you that you’re mad. But I'm 
not saying that. I’m sure you've thought through all possible objec- 
tions more carefully than I. And if you haven't, it makes no difference. I

66. Under prerevolutionary Russian law, marriage without parental consent con- 
stituted a crime for which both the groom and the bride could be punished, and so 
could all who assisted them. The Orthodox church could annul the marriage, although 
in the nineteenth century it rarely did so. Moreover, as Marya Aleksevna realized, judi- 
cial action in such cases was lengthy, costly, and generally ineffectual (see also n. 50 
above). 


What Is to Be Done? 157 


don't know if you're acting foolishly or wisely; but I’m not stupid 
enough to try to dissuade you when I know it’s not possible. Do you 
need my assistance in any way, or not?” 

“We need to find a three-room apartment in an inexpensive neigh- 
borhood. I'll be busy at the Academy, trying to get my documents by 
tomorrow.£7 You could look for the apartment.” 

On Tuesday Lopukhov received his documents and set off to tell 
Mertsalov that the wedding could take place the next day. 

“What time suits you, Aleksei Petrovich?” It didn’t matter to Aleksei 
Petrovich, since he'd be home all day. “In any case, I should be able to 
send Kirsanov to warn you.” 

On Wednesday at eleven o'clock Lopukhov arrived at Konnogvar- 
deisky Boulevard and had to wait there so long for Verochka that he 
began to worry. But there she was, hurrying along. 

“Verochka, my friend, has something happened?” 

“No, my dear, it’s nothing. I’m late because I overslept.” 

“What time did you fall asleep?” 

“I didn’t want to tell you, dear. It was seven o'clock. But I just lay 
there thinking. No, it was even earlier, six o'clock.” 

“Here’s what I wanted to ask you, my dear Verochka. We must get 
married as soon as possible so we can both get some peace of mind.” 

“Yes, dear, we must. As soon as possible.” 

“So, in three or four days .. .” 

“Oh, if only we could, dearest, it would be very clever of you.” 

“I shall find an apartment in three days for sure, and I'll buy what 
household goods we need. Then we'll be able to move in together.” 

“Yes, my dear, we will.” 

“But first we have to get married.” 

“Oh, yes, I'd completely forgotten that.” 

“Well, we can get married today. That’s what | wanted to ask you.” 

“Let's go, dear, and let’s get married. How did you manage to ar- 
range everything? What a clever man you are, my dear!” 

“Tl tell you along the way. Let's go.” 

They arrived at the building, made their way through long corridors 
to the church, found the guard, and sent for Mertsalov. He lived in the 
very same building with the endless corridors. 

“Now, Verochka, I have yet another request. You do know that dur- 
ing the ceremony the couple is supposed to kiss?” 

“Yes, my dear. How embarrassing!” 


67.In prerevolutionary Russia, city dwellers as well as peasants who left their villages 
were required to carry an internal passport attesting to their place of residence, religion, 
marital status, occupation, etc. Students enrolled in institutions of higher education also 
had to deposit their gymnasium diplomas with the relevant authorities. 


158 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Well, so that it won’t be too embarrassing then, let’s kiss each other 
now.” 

“So be it, my dear. But couldn’t we do without it?” 

“No, not during the ceremony. So we must be prepared.” 

They kiss. 

“It's good we had time to prepare, my dear. Here comes the guard. 
Now it won't be too embarrassing during the ceremony.” 

But it wasn’t the guard. The guard had gone to fetch the sexton. It 
was Kirsanov, who'd been waiting for them at Mertsalov’s. 

“Verochka, this is Alexander Matveich Kirsanov, the man you so 
despise and whom you want to forbid me ever to see.” 

“Vera Pavlovna, why do you want to come between our two loving 
hearts?” 

“Precisely because they're so loving,” said Verochka, shaking Kir- 
sanov’s hand. Smiling all the while, she wondered aloud, “Will I come 
to love him the same way you do? You love him very much, don’t you?” 

“Me?” replied Kirsanov. “I love only myself, Vera Pavlovna.” 

“You don’t love him?” 

“We lived together and didn’t argue. That’s enough.” 

“And he doesn't love you?” 

“Not that I've noticed. But let’s ask him. Do you love me, Dmitry?” 

“I have no particular dislike for you.” 

“Well . . .if that's true, Alexander Matveich, I shall not forbid him to 
see you and I too shall come to love you.” 

“Now that's much better, Vera Pavlovna.” 

Aleksei Petrovich arrived. “Here I am. Let's go into the church.” He 
was very cheerful and made a few jokes, but once the ceremony began, 
his voice began to tremble. “What if they do press a lawsuit? Natasha, 
go home to your father. Your husband can’t provide for you and it’s a 
wretched life to have a living husband but have to eat your father's 
bread!” Still, after a few words he regained complete control of himself. 

Natalya Andrevna—or Natasha, as Aleksei Petrovich called her— 
arrived in the middle of the ceremony. Afterward she invited the 
young couple to a small breakfast she'd prepared. They accepted. 
They laughed, danced two quadrilles in couples and even some wal- 
tzes. Aleksei Petrovich, who didn’t know how to dance, played the 
violin. An hour and a half passed by quickly and completely un- 
noticed. The wedding was very jolly. 

“I think I’m expected home for dinner,” said Verochka. “It’s time. 
Now, dear, I'll be able to endure the next three or four days, or even 
more, in my cellar without much difficulty. I won’t have to languish 
any more. Now I have nothing to fear. No, there's no need to come 
with me. I'll go home alone so no one will notice us together.” 


What Is to Be Done? 159 


“Never mind, they won't gobble me up. Don't feel guilty, friends!” 
said Aleksei Petrovich while accompanying Lopukhov and Kirsanov, 
who'd remained behind a few more minutes to allow Verochka to 
leave alone. “Now I'm very glad that Natasha gave me such strong 
encouragement.” 

The next day, after four days of searching, an acceptable apartment 
was found at the far end of Line Five on Vasilievsky Island. With a 
reserve of only 160 rubles, Lopukhov had agreed with his friend that 
for the time being he and Verochka couldn't even consider acquiring 
furniture, crockery, and other household items. Therefore they rented 
three furnished rooms with board included from a local petty bour- 
geois couple.68 The old man passed his days peacefully tending a 
stand where he peddled buttons, ribbons, pins, and so on, near the 
fence between Lines One and Two on Middle Prospekt; he spent eve- 
nings chatting with his old wife. She passed her days darning hun- 
dreds and thousands of items of old clothes brought to her by the 
armful from the flea market. This landlord and landlady also func- 
tioned as the couple's servants. All this cost only thirty rubles a month. 
At that time (some ten years ago) life in Petersburg was inexpensive, 
even by Petersburg standards. This set of arrangements provided them 
with the means to live for three, perhaps even four months. Ten rubles 
a month should suffice for tea, etc. And within four months Lopukhov 
hoped to find lessons, some kind of literary work, or employment in a 
merchant's office—it didn’t matter what. On the very same day they 
found the apartment (and an excellent one it was, which is why they 
had to look for it so long, but finally managed to find it), Lopukhov, who 
had come as usual on Thursday for his lesson, said to Verochka, “You 
can move in tomorrow, my friend. Here's the address. I'll say no more 
to you now, lest someone notice.” 

“You have saved me, my dearest!” 

But now, how was she to leave her house? Tell them outright? 
Verochka would have considered that, but her mother might hurl 
herself into the fray and lock her up. Verochka decided to leave a letter 
in her room. After Marya Aleksevna had heard that her daughter was 
planning to head off in the direction of Nevsky Prospekt and had 
announced that she’d go with her, Verochka returned to her room and 
reclaimed the letter. She thought it better, more honest, to tell her 
straight to her face. Surely her mother wouldn't create a scene in 
public. She need only take care that when she told her mother she was 
standing a reasonable distance from her. Then she would jump into a

social groups, including petty tradesmen, craftsmen, artisans, etc.

cab and hurry away before her mother could manage to grab hold of 
her sleeve. 

In precisely this manner did the striking scene in front of Ruzanov's 
shop occur. 


xxii. 


But so far we've witnessed only the first half of this scene. 

For a moment—no, even less than a moment—Marya Aleksevna, 
who suspected nothing of the sort, stood there stupefied. She was 
trying, but kept failing to understand what it was that her daughter 
was saying. What did it all mean and how could it be? But this was 
only for a moment or even less. ... She roused herself and shouted 
some expletive, but her daughter's cab was already turning onto Nev- 
sky. Marya Aleksevna ran several steps in that direction. She needed a 
cab. She hurled herself to the sidewalk. “Cabbie!” “Where to, ma- 
dame?” Where to, indeed? She thought she'd heard her daughter say 
“Caravannaya Street,” yet the cab had turned left onto Nevsky. Where 
should she go? “Catch up with her, that bitch.” “Catch up with whom, 
madame? Tell me where you want to go! How can I go without any 
directions, not knowing where you're headed?” Marya Aleksevna lost 
her temper and began swearing at the cabbie. “You're drunk, lady, I 
can see that,” he replied, and drove off. Marya Aleksevna kept hurling 
insults after him, called to some other cabbies, tore off in one direction 
for a few steps, then another, waved her arms, and finally came to a 
halt again under the colonnade. She stood there stamping her foot in a 
rage. A group of some five lads peddling all sorts of wares near the 
Shopping Arcade soon gathered around her. They feasted their eyes 
on her, exchanging remarks of a more or less disrespectful nature, and 
addressed her with both wisecracks and well-intentioned advice. 
“That's the way, lady—crocked, and it’s still so early! Good for you, 
lady!” “Lady, hey lady, buy five lemons from me! Use them as a chaser. 
I'll sell them to you cheap!” “Lady, hey lady, don't listen to him. Le- 
mons won't help! What you need is a hair of the dog that bit you!” 
“Lady, hey lady, you sure can curse! Let’s have a contest to see who 
can outdo the other!” Marya Aleksevna, not knowing exactly what she 
was doing, boxed the ear of the closest of her interlocutors—he was a 
lad of about seventeen who was sticking his tongue out at her, not 
without considerable grace. His cap flew off and his full head of hair 
came to hand. Marya Aleksevna seized hold. This act filled her remain- 
ing interlocutors with indescribable enthusiasm. “That's the way, lady! 


What Is to Be Done? 161 


Give it to him!” “Hey, Fedka, give it to her back!” someone remarked, 
but most of them were decidedly on Marya Aleksevna’s side. “What 
can Fedka do against this lady? Give it to him, lady, give it to him! He's 
got it coming to him, the bastard.” By now there were many other 
spectators in addition to the group of boys: cabbies, shopkeepers, and 
passers-by. Then Marya Aleksevna seemed to come to her senses. 
Pushing Fedka’s head away with one last mechanical shove, she 
walked across the street accompanied by ecstatic shouts of praise 
from her interlocutors. 

She managed to realize that she was heading home only when she 
passed the gates of the Corps of Pages.®° She took a cab and arrived 
home safely. She smacked her own Fedya after he let her in; then she 
ran to her cupboard, smacked Matryona, who'd come to see what all 
the fuss was about, ran back to her cupboard and then into Verochka’s 
room. A minute later she came out to her cupboard again and soon 
ran back into Verochka’s room, where she remained for some time. 
Then she wandered around other rooms, swearing all the while, but 
there was no one left to smack. Fedya had escaped to the back stair- 
way; Matryona, after peeking through a crack into Verochka’s room 
and noting that Marya Aleksevna was advancing toward her, ran head- 
long and ended up not in the kitchen but in the bedroom under Marya 
Aleksevna’s bed, where she remained in safety until she was peaceably 
summoned. 

Matryona couldn't say whether or not Marya Aleksevna wandered 
through empty rooms shouting and cursing for a very long time; it 
must have been so because when Pavel Konstantinych returned home 
from work, he caught it too, both “ideally” and “materially.””° But all 
good things come to an end. When at last Marya Aleksevna shouted, 
“Matryona, serve dinner,” Matryona realized that the storm had 
ended. She came out from under the bed and went in to serve dinner. 

Marya Aleksevna refrained from swearing all during dinner; she 
merely snarled, with no aggressive intentions, simply for her own 
satisfaction. Then, instead of going to lie down, she sat completely 
alone—first in silence, then grumbling; then she stopped grumbling 
and sat in silence again. At last she shouted, “Matryona! Go wake your 
master and send him in to me.” 

Matryona, expecting further orders, hadn't dared slip out to the

tavern or anywhere else. She did as she was told and Pavel Konstan- 
tinych made his appearance. 

“Go tell the landlady that your daughter married that devil with your 
permission. Say that you opposed my wishes. Say that you did it to 
please her since you knew that she was against the match. Tell her it's 
all my fault and that you were carrying out her wishes. Tell her it was 
you who arranged the match. Understand me?” 

“Yes, Marya Aleksevna. That’s a very clever plan you thought up.” 

“Well, go do it! It doesn't matter ifshe’s having dinner: call her away 
from the table! Hurry up, while she still doesn’t know anything.” 

The plausibility of Pavel Konstantinych’s words was so evident that 
the landlady would have believed him even if he hadn't possessed the 
gift of persuasive and reverential explication. So great was his persua- 
siveness that the landlady would have forgiven him even if there 
hadn't been conclusive proof that he'd always opposed his wife and 
had intentionally matched Verochka with Lopukhov in order to thwart 
her proposed mismatch with Mikhail Ivanych. “How did they get mar- 
ried?” Why, Pavel Konstantinych had provided them with a generous 
dowry. He gave Lopukhov 5,000 rubles in cash and paid for the entire 
wedding and all household furnishings. It was he who'd carried their 
notes back and forth, he who'd arranged their rendezvous at the apart- 
ment of his colleague Filantiev, a department head and a married man 
(“Because, even though I'm a humble fellow, Your Excellency, I still 
value my daughter’s maidenly honor”). “We really couldn't afford to 
hire a tutor for my young son; that was just a pretext, Your Excellency.” 
He went on and on. Pavel Konstantinych painted his wife’s perfidy in 
the blackest of colors. 

How could she possibly not be convinced and not forgive him? And 
the news itself provided her with great, unexpected joy! Joy softens the 
heart. The landlady began her valedictory address with a very lengthy 
preamble on Marya Aleksevna’s vile thoughts and deeds; at first she 
demanded that Pavel Konstantinych send his wife packing. But he 
entreated her; the landlady herself had said it more for show than for 
anything else. Finally her decision was announced: Pavel Konstan- 
tinych would stay on as manager, their street-front apartment would 
be forfeited. They would be moved to the back courtyard on the un- 
derstanding that his wife never set foot anywhere near the front, lest 
the landlady catch sight of her face, and that she be required to come 
and go through the gates farthest from the landlady's windows. Of the 
twenty rubles a month additional salary, he would forfeit fifteen, keep- 
ing only five as a reward for his zeal in carrying out the landlady's 
wishes and for his expenses in connection with his daughter's wed- 
ding. 


What Is to Be Done? 163 
xxiii. 


Marya Aleksevna had several different schemes in mind for dealing 
with Lopukhov when he showed up that evening. The one closest to 
her heart consisted of hiding two doormen in the kitchen; at a signal 
from her, they would hurl themselves upon Lopukhov and give him a 
sound thrashing. In the most pathetic scenario she and Pavel Kon- 
stantinych would solemnly proclaim a parental curse on their disobe- 
dient daughter and on him, her criminal accomplice, followed by an 
explanation that such a malediction was so powerful that even the 
earth, as everyone knows, refuses to receive the remains of children 
cursed by their parents. But these were all merely dreams, just like the 
landlady’s idea of separating Pavel Konstantinych from his wife. Such 
schemes, like any sort of poetry, serve no practical purpose except to 
comfort the heart, providing the basis for endless, solitary reflections 
and certain dramatic explanations useful in future conversations; to 
wit, here is what I could have and would have done, had I not relented 
so generously. 

The schemes to thrash Lopukhov and to curse her daughter con- 
stituted the “ideal” side of Marya Aleksevna’s thoughts and feelings. 
The “real” side of her mind and soul took a much less elevated, much 
more practical direction. This disparity is the inevitable result of every 
human being’s frailty. Once Marya Aleksevna regained her senses near 
the gate of the Corps of Pages, she understood that her daughter really 
had disappeared, that she’d gotten married and had escaped from 
her. These facts entered her consciousness in the form of the following 
mental exclamation: “I've been robbed!” All the way home she kept 
exclaiming either aloud or to herself, “I've been robbed!” Therefore, 
pausing only a few moments through human weakness to convey her 
grief to Fedya and Matryona (each and every one of us is so distracted 
by the expression of his or her feelings that in the rush of emotion we 
forget the mundane interests of the moment), Marya Aleksevna ran 
into Verochka’s room, searched the drawers of her dressing table and 
her closet, and cast a hurried glance around the room. “No, everything 
seems to be here!” Then she set about verifying this comforting im- 
pression by a more meticulous examination. It turned out that all of 
Verochka’s dresses and other possessions had been left behind, except 
for one pair of modest gold earrings, one old muslin dress, and the old 
coat that Verochka was wearing when she left the house. Regarding 
this question of “real life,” Marya Aleksevna expected that Verochka 
would give Lopukhov a list of the things she required. She firmly 
resolved not to hand over any gold jewelry or other such items; she 
would provide four of her plainest dresses and some of her most worn 


164 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


underclothes. To part with nothing at all was impossible: honorable 
decorum would not allow that, and Marya Aleksevna was a stickler for 
the rules. 

The second question of “real” life was their future relationship with 
the landlady. We've already seen that Marya Aleksevna managed to 
resolve this problem very successfully. 

Now, for the third question: What to do with the wench and the 
villain, her daughter and uninvited son-in-law? Anathematize them? 
That wouldn't be difficult, but it would serve only as a dessert to a 
more substantial repast. And that could take only one form: presenting 
a petition, initiating a lawsuit, and going to court.7! At first, in her 
agitated state, Marya Aleksevna looked at this solution to the problem 
in the “ideal” sense; from that point of view it seemed to be very 
attractive. But the calmer she became after the storm was spent, the 
more the affair appeared to her in a different light. No one knew better 
than she that lawsuits required money and more money; such Cases, 
though tempting in their ideal beauty, demanded larger and larger 
sums and dragged on for a very long time. After consuming a great 
deal of money, they often came to absolutely nothing in the end. 

What was there to do? In the last analysis it turned out that there 
were only two possibilities: to excoriate Lopukhov to her own satisfac- 
tion and reject all his efforts to claim Verochka’s belongings and then 
to threaten to lodge an official complaint. But she'd have to abuse him 
in the strongest possible terms, to her heart's content. 

However, she didn’t even manage to abuse him at all! Lopukhov 
arrived and began in the following way: “Verochka and I ask that you 
forgive us, Marya Aleksevna and Pavel Konstantinych, for acting with- 
out your consent... .” 

At that point Marya Aleksevna screamed, “I curse her, the good-for- 
nothing girl!” 

But instead of the phrase “good-for-nothing girl” she managed to get 
out only the first syllable, because Lopukhov announced in a very loud 
voice: “I will not listen to your abuse. I have come to discuss the 
business at hand. You're angry and unable to talk calmly. Therefore I 
will speak with Pavel Konstantinych alone, and you, Marya Aleksevna, 
can send in Fedya or Matryona to summon us after you've calmed 
down.” As soon as he said this he began to move Pavel Konstantinych 
toward his study; he spoke so loudly that there was no possibility of 
outshouting him. Marya Aleksevna was forced to stop talking. 

He led Pavel Konstantinych as far as the parlor door, stopped there, 
turned, and said: “Well now, Marya Aleksevna, it looks as if I may be 


71. See n. 66 above. 


What Is to Be Done? 165 


able to talk to you, too. But we must speak calmly and only about the 
business at hand.” 

She was just about to start screaming again, but he interrupted her: 
“If you can’t speak calmly, then we'll leave.” 

“Where are you going, you fool?” shouted Marya Aleksevna to her 
husband. 

“He’s dragging me away.” 

“If Pavel Konstantinych were to be similarly inclined to deal with me 
in an impassioned way, then I would also leave. It really doesn’t matter 
to me. But, Pavel Konsantinych, why do you allow her to call you such 
names? Marya Aleksevna doesn’t understand how things work. She 
probably thinks she can do whatever she wants to us. But youre a civil 
servant, and you must know how things are done. Tell her she can do 
nothing to Verochka now, and even less to me.” 

“That bastard knows there's nothing I can do to them,” thought 
Marya Aleksevna, so she told Lopukhov that she'd flared up at first as a 
mother, but now she could speak with more composure. 

Lopukhov returned with Pavel Konstantinych and they all sat down. 
He asked her to listen until he finished everything he had to say; then 
she'd get a chance to speak. He started talking, raising his voice con- 
siderably whenever she tried to interrupt him; thus he managed to 
finish his speech. He said that it was impossible to unmarry them and 
therefore the affair with Storeshnikov was a lost cause, as they them- 
selves knew full well. Consequently, a lawsuit would both tire them 
out and be to no avail, but they could do as they wished. If they had 
extra money available, they might even be encouraged to try. There 
was really no reason to be upset since Verochka had never intended to 
marry Storeshnikov; that had always been an unrealizable scheme, as 
Marya Aleksevna must have known herself. A girl has to be married off 
sooner or later, and that entails considerable expense for the parents. 
There is the dowry and then the wedding itself, which costs a fair 
amount, but the dowry is the main thing. Consequently, Marya Alek- 
sevna and Pavel Konstantinych ought to be grateful to their daughter 
for getting married without causing them any expense whatever. 
That’s the way he spoke, more or less, and he carried on in this 
detailed way for a full half hour. 

When he finished, Marya Aleksevna realized that there was nothing 
to be gained by talking to such a villain; therefore she began to speak 
about her own feelings. She was personally aggrieved by the fact that 
Verochka had gotten married without requesting parental consent 
because it was so very painful to a mother’s heart. Once they touched 
upon the subject of maternal feelings and grief, the conversation for 
both of them naturally began to assume the form “Well, we can’t not 


166 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


speak about that, since that’s what propriety demands.” So they satis- 
fied all the demands of propriety and did speak about it. Marya Alek- 
sevna said that as a loving mother, she felt aggrieved. Lopukhov said 
that as a loving mother, she ought not to. After they fulfilled a measure 
of propriety by appropriately lengthy digressions on feelings, they 
moved on to another point, also required by propriety; namely, how 
they, on the one hand, had always desired their daughter’s happiness, 
while he, on the other hand, had absolutely no doubt about that. 
When the conversation had dragged on for the appropriate length of 
time on this subject, they began to say their good-byes, accompanied 
by lengthy explanations dictated by the rules of gentry decorum. As a 
result of all this, it turned out that Lopukhov, who appreciated the 
distress suffered by her maternal heart, did not ask Marya Aleksevna to 
grant her daughter permission to meet her mother at the present time 
because perhaps such a meeting would still be too painful for that 
maternal heart. But, as Marya Aleksevna would continue to hear about 
Verochka’s great happiness (which, of course, had always been her 
sole desire), perhaps her heart would be sufficiently softened so that 
she might find herself in a position to meet with her daughter without 
grieving. 

When they had agreed upon this, they parted amicably. 

“What a villain!” said Marya Aleksevna after showing her son-in-law 
to the door. 

That night she even dreamed that she was sitting near the window 
and saw a splendid carriage coming along the street. It stops and an 
elegant lady gets out with a man; they come into her room and the 
lady speaks. “Mama, look how well my husband dresses me!” The lady 
is none other than Verochka. Marya Aleksevna looks and sees that the 
material for Verochka’s dress is very expensive. Verochka says, “The 
material alone cost five hundred silver rubles, but that’s nothing for us, 
mama. I have a dozen such dresses. Better look at my fingers, mama! 
These cost even more.” Marya Aleksevna looks at Verochka’s fingers 
and sees rings with large diamonds. “This ring cost two thousand 
rubles, mama, and this one is even more, four thousand rubles, mama. 
Look at my bosom, mama. This brooch is even more expensive. It costs 
ten thousand rubles!” And the man (it’s Dmitry Sergeich) says, “All this 
is nothing for us, dear Marya Aleksevna. The really important thing is 
in my pocket. Here, mama dearest, look at this thick wallet and see 
how it’s bulging with hundred-ruble notes. I am giving it to you, ma- 
ma, because it too is nothing for us! But this wallet, which is even 
thicker, dear mama, I won't give to you; it contains no paper money, 
only bank drafts and promissory notes. Each one is worth more than 
the entire wallet I gave you, dear mama, Marya Aleksevna!” “Dmitry 


What Is to Be Done? 167 


Sergeich, my dear son, you certainly know how to ensure the happi- 
ness of my daughter and her whole family. But how did it come about, 
my dear son, that you acquired so much wealth?” “Dear mama, I’ve 
gone in for tax farming.”72 

Upon awakening, Marya Aleksevna thought to herself, “He really 
ought to go in for tax farming.” 


xxiv. Eulogy of Marya Aleksevna 


You cease to be an important personage in Verochka’s life, Marya 
Aleksevna. In parting with you the author of this tale asks that you not 
complain about quitting the scene at a moment that is less than ad- 
vantageous to you. Don't think that you've lost our respect as a result. 
We leave you after you've been made a fool of—but this in no way 
diminishes our view of your intelligence, Marya Aleksevna. Your mis- 
take doesn’t bear witness against you. You encountered a sort of peo- 
ple you weren't used to dealing with; it was no sin to be deceived by 
them, judging from your own former experiences. Your entire previous 
life led to the conclusion that people are divided into two categories— 
fools and swindlers: “Anyone who isn't a fool is surely a swindler,” you 
thought, “and not to be a swindler means that you're fool.” This view, 
Marya Aleksevna, was very accurate; until quite recently, Marya Alek- 
sevna, it was completely accurate. You had encountered people who 
talked extremely well; you realized that every one without exception 
was either a schemer who pulled the wool over other folks’ eyes with 
fine phrases or a full-grown silly child, ignorant of life and unable to 
apply himself in any way. For that reason, Marya Aleksevna, you didn't 
believe in fine phrases; you considered them either stupid or decep- 
tive, and you were right. Your view of other people was completely 
formed when you encountered the first woman who was neither stu- 
pid nor a swindler; you're to be forgiven for being confused, for paus- 
ing to consider, for not knowing what to think or how to treat her. Your 
view of other people was completely formed when you encountered 
the first honorable man who wasn't a simple-minded, pitiful child, 
who knew life as well as you, whose judgments were no less accurate 
than yours, and who knew how to do business no less skillfully than 
you. You're to be forgiven for making a mistake and taking him for the 
same kind of rascal that you are. These mistakes, Marya Aleksevna, 


72. Until 1863, the Russian government raised a significant portion of its revenues by 
selling monopoly rights over the sale of vodka and some other commodities in a particu- 
lar area. Holders of these rights, called tax farmers, often abused them and thereby 
managed to amass large fortunes. 


168 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


don’t diminish my respect for you as a clever and capable woman. You 
dragged your husband out of obscurity and you've provided for your 
old age—these are both good things that were difficult for you to 
achieve. The means you employed were bad, but your environment 
provided you with none other. The means belong to your environ- 
ment, not to your personality; the dishonor is not yours, but the honor 
is to your intelligence and your strength of character. 

Are you content, Marya Aleksevna, with this acknowledgment of 
your good qualities? Of course, because you never thought of claiming 
to be kind or good. In a moment of involuntary candor, you acknow!l- 
edged that you're a wicked and dishonest person, and that you con- 
sidered neither wickedness nor dishonesty to be dishonorable in your 
case, demonstrating that you couldn't have been different given the 
circumstances of your life. Consequently, you won’t be too concerned 
if 1 don’t add to this eulogy of your intelligence and strength of charac- 
ter any praise of your virtues. You don't think you have any and 
wouldn't consider them virtues; you'd be more likely to consider them 
stupidity. Therefore, you demand no further praise beyond what I've 
already given you. 

However, I can say one more thing in your honor. Of all the people I 
dislike and with whom I would prefer to have nothing to do, I would 
still rather deal with you than with the others. Of course you're ruth- 
less when it comes to yourown advantage. But if there’s no advantage 
to you in doing harmn to someone, you won't do it simply for the sake 
of some stupid little passion. You figure it's not worth spending the 
time, effort, and money uselessly. Naturally, you’d be delighted to 
roast your daughter and her husband over a slow fire, but you man- 
aged to curb your desire for revenge and to reason coolly about the 
matter; you realized that you couldn't succeed in roasting them. It’s a 
great quality, Marya Aleksevna, to be able to recognize an impossibility! 
Having done so, you chose not to initiate a lawsuit that would have 
failed to ruin those who'd caused you such irritation. You realized that 
those insignificant annoyances that a lawsuit could have caused them 
would have caused you much greater inconvenience and loss. There- 
fore you abandoned the idea. If it’s impossible to vanquish the enemy, 
if inflicting a small wound on him would result in inflicting a larger 
one on yourself, then there’s no point in beginning the battle. Having 
understood this, you had the good sense and courage to submit to the 
inevitable without causing useless harm to yourself and to others. 
That's also a great quality, Marya Aleksevna. Yes, one can still deal with 
you, because you don't wish evil for evil’s sake if it’s to your own 
detriment. That’s a very rare quality, and a very great one, Marya 
Aleksevna. There are millions of people who are far more dangerous to 


What Is to Be Done? 169 


themselves and to others than you are, even though they don’t look as 
horribly harmful as you do. Of all those bad ones, youre still better 
than most precisely because you're not unreasonable and not dimwit- 
ted. I'd be glad to wipe you off the face of the earth, but I respect you. 
You don't do too much damage. You're now engaged in a bad business 
because your environment demands it; but if we were to provide you 
with a different environment, you'd gladly become harmless, even 
beneficial, because you don’t want to do evil without financial reward, 
and if it were in your own interest, you’d do anything at all, you’d even 
act decently and nobly if necessary. You are capable of it, Marya Alek- 
sevna. You're not to blame that this capacity is inactive in you, and that 
antithetical capacities are active instead. You still have it, and that 
can’t be said of the others. Worthless people aren’t capable of doing 
anything; you're merely a bad person, not a worthless one. Morally 
speaking, you're better than most. 

“Are you content, Marya Aleksevna?” 

“What should I be satisfied with, my good sir? My circumstances are 
rather poor, aren’t they?” 

“That's as it should be, Marya Aleksevna.” 


CHAPTER THREE 


Marriage and Second Love 


Three months have passed since Verochka escaped from her cellar. 
The Lopukhovs' affairs are progressing well. He's found sufficient les- 
sons and has obtained work at a publishing house translating a text- 
book on geography. Vera Pavlovna has two pupils of her own—noth- 
ing to envy, but not too bad either. Together they're earning about 
eighty rubles a month; although they can lead only a very modest 
existence, they're not in any need. Their means are increasing gradu- 
ally and they reckon that in about four months or even less they'll be 
able to furnish their household (and that’s just what happened subse- 
quently). 

Of course their life was not arranged precisely the way Verochka 
described it, half-jesting and half-serious, on the day of their fantastic 
engagement; still, it was very close to that. The old man and woman in 
whose house they lived had a great deal to say to each other about the 
strange way these newlyweds lived; it was as if they weren't new- 
lyweds at all, not even husband and wife, but as if they were God 
knows what. 

“Well, Petrovna,”? as I see it and as you tell it, it’s as if, howcan I put 
it, she was his sister or he was her brother.” 

“What a comparison! There’s no ceremony between brother and 
sister. But just look at them! He gets up, puts on his dressing gown, 
and sits waiting until you bring in the samovar. He makes tea and then 
calls her, she’s also all dressed when she comes out. What kind of 


73. In Russian, a person normally is referred to by his or her first name followed by a 
patronymic formed from the father’s first name. Use of the patronymic alone, as here, is 
a form of lower-class slang. 


170 


What Is to Be Done? 171 


brother and sister is that? Here’s what I think: sometimes poor people 
live together in one apartment because of their poverty. That’s what I'd 
compare them to.” 

“And how is it, Petrovna, that the husband can’t enter his wife’s 
room? If she’s not dressed he won't go in! What do you say to that?” 

“And what about how they separate at bedtime? He says, ‘Good 
night, dear, sleep well!’ They part and each goes to his own room; they 
sit reading books and sometimes he’s writing. Listen to what hap- 
pened once. She went to bed and was reading a book. I was merely 
listening through the partition. I couldn't fall asleep for some reason 
or other. I heard her get up. Only, what do you think? She stood in 
front of the mirror to comb her hair. Just like she was planning to greet 
visitors. I heard her leave her room. So I went into the corridor, stood 
on a chair, and peeked through the transom into his room. I heard her 
come up to his door. ‘May I come in, dear?’ she asks. ‘Just a minute, 
Verochka,’ he says. He'd also gone to bed. He puts on his clothes, his 
dressing gown too. | figure he’s about ready to put on a tie, but no, he 
doesn't. He straightens out his clothes and says, ‘You may come in 
now, Verochka.’ She says, ‘There’s something in this book I don’t un- 
derstand. Can you explain it to me?’ He does. She says, ‘Forgive me for 
disturbing you, dear.’ He says, ‘It’s nothing, Verochka. I was only res- 
ting. You didn’t disturb me at all.’ And she left.” 

“She left?” 

“Left.” 

“He did nothing?” 

“Nothing. Don’t be so astonished that she left, but that she got 
dressed before she went in! He says, ‘Wait a minute,’ then gets dressed 
and says, ‘Come in.’ So now tell me, what kind of custom is that?” 

“Here's what I think, Petrovna. It’s some sort of sect. You know there 
are all kinds of them.”74 

“It seems like that. Maybe you're right!” 

Another conversation. 

“Danilych, I asked her about their customs. I said, ‘Don’t get angry 
that I’m asking, but what religion are you?’ ‘The usual,’ she says, ‘Rus- 
sian Orthodox.’ ‘And your husband?’ ‘He’s Orthodox, too,’ she says. 
‘You wouldn't belong to any sect, would you?’ ‘No,’ she says, ‘why do 
you ask?’ ‘Here’s why, ma’am. I don’t know whether to call you Miss or 
Mrs. Are you living with your husband or not?’ She laughed and said, ‘I 


am. 


74. Particularly after the schism in the Russian Orthodox church in the late seven- 
teenth century, a number of radical, often regionalized Christian sects emerged, espe- 
cially among the peasantry and lower urban classes, as a form of both religious dissent 
and social protest. See also n. 57 above. 


172 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“She laughed?” 

“She laughed and said, ‘I am.’ ‘Then why do you have such a custom 
that you don't see him unless you're dressed first, as if you weren't 
living with him?’ She says, ‘So he won't see me disheveled. It’s got 
nothing to do with any sect.’ ‘Well, what is it, then?’ I asked. ‘So that 
there'll be more love and fewer quarrels.” 

“Well, that certainly seems to be true, Petrovna. They're always in 
good form.” 

“And here's what else she said. ‘If,’ she says, ‘I don’t want strangers 
to see me in disarray, and if I love my husband more than anyone else, 
then I should never show myself to him without washing my face 
first.” 

“That seems to be true, too, Petrovna. Do you know why we covet 
our neighbors’ wives? Because we see them all dressed up and we see 
our own in disarray. That's what it says in the Scriptures, the proverbs 
of Solomon.’5 He was the wisest king of all.” 


ii. 


All was going well with the Lopukhovs. Vera Pavlovna was usually 
cheerful, but once, five months or so after their wedding, Dmitry Ser- 
geich returned home from a lesson to find his wife in a peculiar state 
of mind. Her eyes were shining with pride and joy. Dmitry Sergeich 
recalled that for the last several days he’d observed in her signs of 
pleasant restlessness, cheerful reflection, and tender pride. 

“My friend, you seem so very happy! Won't you share it with me?” 

“Yes, I think I am happy; but wait a while, my dear. I'll tell you when 
it's for sure. I must wait a few more days. It’s going to be a source of 
great joy. I know you'll be happy; Kirsanov and Mertsalov will like it, 
too.” 

“What in the world is it?” 

“Have you forgotten our agreement, my dear? No questions! I'll tell 
you when it’s for sure.” 

Over a week passed. 

“I'm ready to share my joy with you, my dear. But you must advise 
me, since you know all about it. You know that I’ve wanted to do 
something for quite a while. Well, now I’ve conceived a plan to orga- 
nize a dressmaking establishment. Isn’t that a good idea?” 


75. In fact, the proverbs of Solomon contain no such statement. In Chernyshevsky's 
original manuscript, Vera Pavlovna's landlord adds, “Whether or not the proverbs of 
Solomon really say this, | don’t know for sure.” On Chernyshevsky's use of deliberate 
mistranslation, see n. 5 above. 


What Is to Be Done? 173 


“Well, my dear, we've had an agreement that I was to refrain from 
kissing your hand. But that was a general rule; it didn’t apply to occa- 
sions such as this one. Give me your hand, Vera Pavlovna.” 

“Later, my dear, after I've succeeded.” 

“But when you have, you won't give me your hand to kiss! Then 
Kirsanov, Aleksei Petrovich, and everyone else will kiss it. But for now 
I'm still the only one. Your intention alone deserves it.” 

“By force? I’ll scream!” 

“Go ahead!” 

“Tl get flustered, my dear, and I won't say anything. As if it were so 
important!” 

“It is, my friend. We all talk a lot but do nothing. You began thinking 
about all this after we did, but you resolved to get down to work 
sooner.” 

Verochka laid her head on her husband's chest and hid her face. 
“You're praising me too much.” 

Her husband kissed her head. “What a clever little head.” 

“Stop it, dear. It’s impossible to tell you anything; look at the way 
you're behaving.” 

“I'll stop. Tell me more, my good Verochka.” 

“How dare you Call me that?” 

“Well then, my wicked Verochka.” 

“Oh, you! You keep on interrupting. Sit quietly and listen. It seems to 
me the main thing is, right from the start, when I have to choose a few 
people, I must do it very carefully. They must be genuinely honest and 
good, not frivolous or fickle, but reliable and gentle, so that futile 
quarrels won’t break out among them and they in turn will be able to 
select other people. Isn't that right?” 

“It is, my dear.” 

“So far I've found three such young women. Oh, how I've searched! 
For the last three months I've been visiting shops and making acquain- 
tances. And now I've found them. They're splendid girls, and I've 
become well acquainted with them.” 

“And they have to be experts at their trade. Your business must 
stand on its own merits and everything should be based on commer- 
cial calculation.” 

“Of course it must.” 

“So what else is there? Why do you need my advice?” 

“About the details, my dear.” 

“Tell me about them. You've probably thought them all out yourself 
and can adapt to the circumstances. You know that the most impor- 
tant things are principle, character, and ability. Details are determined 
by the particular conditions of each situation.” 


174 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“I know. Nevertheless, when you say it’s so, I'll feel more certain.” 

They talked for a long time. Lopukhov found nothing to correct in 
his wife's plan, while she found that it was being elaborated and 
clarified in the process of telling him about it. 

The next day Lopukhov carried the following announcement to the 
office of the Police Gazette: “Vera Pavlovna Lopukhova is now accept- 
ing orders for ladies’ dresses, underwear,” etc., “at reasonable rates,” 
and so on and so forth. 

That very same morning Vera Pavlovna set off to visit Julie. “She 
doesn't know my married name. Tell her that it's Mademoiselle Rozal- 
skaya.” 

“My child, you’ve come to see me without a veil, quite openly, and 
you give your own name to my servant! This is madness! You'll ruin 
yourself, my child!” 

“I’m now a married woman and can go where | want and do what I 
want.” 

“But your husband will find out.” 

“He'll be here in an hour.” 

The questions began: How did she get married? Julie was ecstatic. 
She hugged and kissed her and wept. After this paroxysm had passed, 
Vera Pavlovna began to explain the reason for her visit. 

“You know we only remember our old friends when we need them. I 
have a big favor to ask of you. I’m setting up a dressmaking establish- 
ment. Send me your orders and recommend me to your friends. I can 
sew well and I have good assistants. You even know one of them.” 

Julie did indeed know one of them to be an excellent seamstress. 

“Here are some samples of my work. And I made this dress I’m 
wearing. You can see how well it fits.” 

Julie carefully examined the fit of her dress; then she scrutinized the 
stitching on a shawl and a pair of sleeves. She was very satisfied. 

“My child, you could be very successful. You have skill and good 
taste. But you will need an elegant shop on Nevsky Prospekt.” 

“Yes, and in time I'll have one. That's my goal. But for now, I'll take in 
orders at home.” 

They finished their business and began to talk about Verochka’s 
marriage once again. 

“That Storeshnik fellow went on a terrible binge for two weeks. Then 
he made it up with Adele. I’m very happy for her. He’s a good fellow. 
It’s a pity, though, that Adele has no character.” 

Once launched on this subject, Julie began to describe the adven- 
tures of Adele, among others. Mademoiselle Rozalskaya was a married 
woman now, so Julie saw no need to restrain herself. At first she spoke 
rationally; then she got more and more carried away and began to 


What Is to Be Done? 175 


describe her revels with great enthusiasm; she went on and on. At first 
Vera Pavlovna was embarrassed, but Julie didn't notice it. Then Vera 
Pavlovna recovered her self-possession and began to listen with the 
same painful interest with which one examines the features of a well- 
loved face disfigured by disease. But soon Lopukhov arrived. Julie was 
instantly transformed into a respectable society lady, endowed with 
the sternest tact. She didn’t maintain this pose for long, however. After 
congratulating Lopukhov on having so beautiful a wife, she became 
excited again. “Yes,” she cried, “we must celebrate your marriage.” She 
ordered an impromptu breakfast, complete with champagne. Veroch- 
ka had to drink half a glass to toast her marriage, half a glass to her 
new establishment, and half a glass to Julie’s health. Her head started 
spinning. Then she and Julie began to shout, yell, and raise a rumpus. 
Julie pinched Verochka, jumped up, and began to run around, chased 
by Verochka. They ran through all the rooms, bouncing on chairs. 
Lopukhov sat and laughed. It came to an end when Julie decided to 
boast about her strength. “I can lift you into the air with one hand.” 
“Oh, no, you can't.” They started to struggle, but fell onto the sofa; they 
no longer tried to stand up, but merely continued to shout and giggle; 
soon they both fell asleep. 

This was the first time in a long while that Lopukhov didn’t know 
what to do. Should he wake them? What a pity to spoil such a cheerful 
encounter with an awkward conclusion. He stood up quietly and 
looked for something to read. He found a book, The Chronicles of the 
Oval Window, compared to which Faublas seemed pale indeed.” He 
settled down on a sofa at the other end of the room and began to read. 
A quarter of an hour later he dozed off out of sheer boredom. 

Two hours later Pauline woke Julie. It was time for dinner. They sat 
down to eat without Serge, who was attending some gala affair. Julie 
and Verochka became raucous again and then grew more serious; by 
the time they parted, both were entirely serious. Julie inquired (it 
hadn’t occurred to her before) as to why Verochka was opening a 
dressmaking establishment. Why, if she were concerned about money, 
it would be much easier to become an actress or even a singer, since 
she had such a powerful voice. At this inquiry they both sat down 
again. Verochka began to explain her idea, and Julie became enthusi-

(1829-1833) by Napoleon's commissar of war, G. Touchard-Lafosse (1780-1847), with the 
picaresque novel Les Aventures du chevalier de Faublas (Paris, 1787-1789), by the republi- 
can sympathizer Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai (1760-1797). Immensely popular 
though insubstantial, the Chroniques expose the intimate lives of French monarchs from 
Louis XIII to Louis XVI; Louvet’s work humorously relates the amorous adventures of a 
French aristocrat at the end of the eighteenth century.

astic once more. She showered blessings mixed with tears upon her, 
declaring that she, Julie Letellier, although a fallen woman, neverthe- 
less knew what virtue was all about. There were more tears, embraces, 
and then more blessings. 

Four days later Julie arrived at Vera Pavlovna’s and presented her 
with rather a lot of orders as well as the addresses of several of her 
acquaintances from whom she might receive even more. She brought 
Serge along with her, having insisted upon it, saying, “Lopukhov called 
on us. Now you must pay them a visit.” Julie behaved in a dignified 
manner and managed to keep it up without the least indiscretion, 
even though they spent considerable time at the Lopukhovs'’. She real- 
ized that there were no walls, only thin partitions, and she knew how 
to protect other people's reputations. She did not become excited; 
instead, she assumed a more bucolic pose. She dwelled with delight 
on all aspects of the Lopukhovs' impoverished way of life, concluding 
that it was the best way to live, even the only way, and that true 
happiness was feasible only in modest surroundings. She went so far 
as to announce to Serge that they should go off to live in Switzerland, 
settle in a small house amidst fields and mountains on the shore of a 
lake, and there love each other, catch fish, and tend their garden.77 
Serge said that he was in complete agreement, but would wait to see 
what Julie would say about it three or four hours later. 

The noise of Julie’s elegant carriage and the clatter made by her 
wonderful horses produced a staggering impression on the inhabi- 
tants of the Fifth Line between Middle and Small Prospekts, where 
nothing comparable had been seen at least since the time of Peter the 
Great, if not earlier.”8 Many eyes observed how the miraculous phe- 
nomenon halted before the locked gates of a small, one-story house 
with seven windows, how an even more astonishing phenomenon 
emerged from that wonderful carriage: a splendid lady and a glittering 
officer, whose high position was indisputable. Disappointment was 
widespread when the gates were opened a moment later and the 
carriage drove into the courtyard: the curious had been deprived of 
the hope of seeing the majestic officer and the even more majestic lady 
again at their departure. When Danilych returned home from work, 
the following conversation with Petrovna ensued. 

“Well, Danilych, it seems that our tenants must be descended from 


77. Perhaps a reference to the satirical masterpiece Candide (1759), by the leading 
Enlightenment philosopher, Francois Marie Arouet (Voltaire, 1694-1778). Chernyshevsky 
may be contrasting the activism of his “new people” with the social disengagement of 
both Julie and Candide. At the end of Voltaire's novel, Candide declares that “we must 
cultivate our garden.”

this spot before the founding of St. Petersburg by Peter the Great in 1703.

important people. Today a general and his wife came to visit them. She 
was dressed so well that I don’t even know how to describe her, and 
he had two stars on him.” 

It was truly amazing that Petrovna had seen two stars on Serge, who 
didn't have any at all, and, if he did, he probably wouldn't have worn 
them while escorting Julie. But that she actually saw two stars and was 
neither mistaken nor bragging, it’s not she who so testified, but I who 
vouch for it. She did see them. You and I know very well that he had no 
stars; however, from Petrovna’s point of view, it was impossible not to 
see two Stars on someone with that appearance. And so she saw them. 
I’m not joking when I say that she really did. 

“And what livery the lackey wore, Danilych: English cloth, five rubles 
an arshin.7? He was such a stern man, so dignified, but he spoke 
politely. He let me feel the wonderful cloth on his sleeve. Obviously 
they have money to burn8° They spent about two hours with our 
tenants, Danilych, everyone talking so simply, just like you and me. 
They didn’t even bow to them, but sat laughing with them. Our young 
man sat with the general, both of them sprawling in armchairs and 
smoking. Our tenant sprawling and smoking with a general! And that's 
nothing! His cigarette went out and he borrowed the general's to light 
his own! I can't tell you how respectfully the general kissed our young 
lady's hand. What can we make of all this, Danilych?” 

“Everything comes from God, that’s what I think. Whether its friends 
or relatives, it all comes from God.” 

“So it does, Danilych. There's no doubt about it. I think that either he 
or she must be a brother or a sister of the general or his wife. To tell 
you the truth, I think she’s the general’s sister.” 

“Why do you think that, Petrovna? It doesn’t seem like that to me. If 
it were, then our young people would have more money.” 

“Well, Danilych, and what if her mother gave birth to her out of 
wedlock or her father wasn’t married? That would explain the faces, 
since there’s really no resemblance.” 

“That could be it, Petrovna, out of wedlock. It sometimes happens.” 

During the next four days Petrovna enjoyed great importance in her 
rag shop. For three days the shop attracted a number of customers 
from that other one across the way. In the interest of enlightenment, 
Petrovna even neglected her mending for a while to satisfy the general 
thirst for knowledge. 

One result of all this was that about a week later Pavel Konstan- 
tinych came to visit his daughter and son-in-law.

178 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Marya Aleksevna had been collecting information about her daugh- 
ter and the villain—not constantly or carefully, but just in general, 
purely out of scientific curiosity. One of her fellow gossips who lived 
on Vasilievsky Island had been commissioned to make inquiries about 
Vera Pavlovna whenever she was in their neighborhood. She would 
pass this information along, sometimes once a month, sometimes 
more often, as it happened. The Lopukhovs were living in harmony. 
No scandal to report. There was one thing, though: they had a lot of 
young friends, almost all of them men, and all of very modest means. 
They too were living modestly, but obviously there was some money. 
Not only were they not selling anything, they were actually buying. She 
had made herself two silk dresses. They purchased two sofas, a table 
to match, and half a dozen chairs, all secondhand. They paid only 
forty rubles, but the furniture was of good quality and worth about a 
hundred. They've notified their landlords to look for new tenants. “Ina 
month we’re going to move into our own apartment,” he said. “We're 
very grateful to you for everything.” And the landlords replied, “As we 
are to you.” 

Marya Aleksevna was comforted by these reports. She was a coarse 
woman and a very wicked one; she tormented her daughter and was 
ready to kill her or ruin her for her own interests; and she cursed her 
for thwarting her scheme to become rich. All of this was true. But does 
it follow that she felt no love at all for her own daughter? No, it doesn’t 
follow in the least. When her scheme was ruined, when her daughter 
had escaped her clutches forever, what was left to be done? There was 
no use crying over spilled milk. After all, she was her daughter. Now 
there was no chance that doing any harm to Vera Pavlovna could serve 
Marya Aleksevna’s interests, and the mother sincerely wished her 
daughter well. Then again, it’s not that she wished her God knows 
what; but that makes no difference. At least she wasn’t spying on the 
girl’s every move. The measures adopted for watching her daughter 
were Casual, just so, because, you'll agree, how was it possible not to 
do it? The well-wishing was just as casual, but still, you'll agree, Ver- 
ochka was her daughter after all. Why not be reconciled? All the more, 
since that villain of a son-in-law, to all appearances, seemed to be a 
reliable man; perhaps he might even prove useful later on. Thus Marya 
Aleksevna gradually moved toward the idea of renewing relations with 
her daughter. It would take at least half a year, perhaps a whole year, 
to reach that stage. There was no need to rush; time has patience. 
But news of the visit by the general and the general's wife suddenly 
pushed the matter ahead the rest of the way. The villain had proved 
himself to be a scoundrel as well. A former miserable little student 
with no rank, with only a few kopecks to his name, had become friends 


What Is to Be Done? 179 


with a young, and therefore obviously very important, wealthy general 
and had introduced his wife to the general’s wife. Such a man will go 
far. Or was it Verochka who'd made the acquaintance of the general’s 
wife and who'd introduced her husband to the general? It didn’t mat- 
ter. It meant that Verochka would go far. 

And so, right after receiving news of this visit, Marya Aleksevna dis- 
patched her husband to inform Vera Pavlovna that she had forgiven 
her daughter and was now inviting her to pay a visit. Vera Pavlovna 
and her husband returned home with Pavel Konstantinych and spent 
the early evening there. The meeting was cool and somewhat strained. 
They spoke mostly about Fedya, since that wasn't a delicate subject. 
He was attending the gymnasium. They had persuaded Marya Alek- 
sevna to enroll him as a live-in student there. Dmitry Sergeich would 
visit him and Vera Pavlovna would invite him to spend holidays with 
them. Somehow or other they managed to stretch the conversation 
out to teatime and then the Lopuhkovs made haste to depart. They 
said that they were expecting guests at home that evening. 

For the last half year Vera Pavlovna had been breathing pure air; her 
lungs had become unaccustomed to the oppressive atmosphere of 
cunning words (every single one of which was uttered for reasons of 
greedy self-interest) and to hearing deceitful thoughts and base 
schemes. Her former cellar made a horrible impression on her. The 
filth, vulgarity, and prevailing cynicism all struck her now as a harsh 
novelty. 

“Where did I find the strength to live in such vile confines? How did 
I manage to breathe in that cellar? I not only lived there but even 
remained in good health. That’s astonishing, incomprehensible! How 
did I manage to foster a love for the good? It's hard to understand and 
most improbable,” thought Vera Pavlovna after she'd returned to her 
own apartment. She felt as if she’d been saved from suffocation. 

Not long after returning home, the guests they'd been expecting 
arrived. They were the usual visitors: Aleksei Petrovich, Natasha, and 
Kirsanov. They passed the evening as always, but Vera Pavlovna’s new 
life with its purity of thought and its community of wholesome people 
seemed twice as delightful to her. As usual, the conversation was both 
cheerful, with many reminiscences, and serious, about everything un- 
der the sun: from historical events of the time (the civil strife in Kansas 
which was the forerunner of the Great Civil War between the North 
and the South,®! which in turn was to be the forerunner of even greater 
events, not only in America, preoccupied this little circle. Now

everyone talks about politics; then only a few people did, including Lo- 
pukhov, Kirsanov, and their friends); the current debate about the 
chemical basis of agriculture according to Liebig’s theory;82 the laws 
governing historical progress—an unavoidable subject of conversation 
in such circles at that time* the great importance of distinguishing 
real desires, which seek and find their own fulfillment, from phan- 
tasmic desires, which can't be fulfilled and don’t need to be, like a false 
thirst during a fever, which admits to only one satisfaction, curing the 
organism, whose diseased condition engenders those phantasmic de- 
sires through a distortion of real ones; to the significance of this funda- 
mental distinction established at that time by anthropological philoso- 
phy.®4 They talked about other things as well, both similar to these and 
not so similar, but related. At times the ladies listened in to this 
learned discourse; it was conducted in such a simple way that it 
hardly seemed like learned discourse; often they intervened with 
questions of their own. But it goes without saying that for the most 
part they didn’t listen,85 and even doused Lopukhov and Aleksei Pe- 
trovich with water when they got too excited over the enormous im- 
portance of mineral fertilizers. But Aleksei Petrovich and Lopukhov 
persevered unwavering in their learned discourse. Kirsanov didn't 
provide much assistance; he was more on the side of the ladies, even 
entirely so. The three of them played the piano, sang songs, and 
laughed until late into the night, when, exhausted, they finally man- 
aged to separate the invincible zealots of serious conversation. 


iii. Vera Pavlovna’s Second Dream 


Now Vera Pavlovna falls asleep and has a dream. First she sees a 
field. Her husband, that is, her sweetheart, and Aleksei Petrovich are 


82. The German chemist Baron Justus von Liebig (1803-1873), a professor at Giessen 
and Munich universities, whose work in agricultural chemistry contributed significantly 
to the development of artificial fertilizers. 

83. The discontented, educated Russians who gathered together in the 1850s to 
discuss political and social issues frequently debated the nature and sources of histor- 
ical progress, partly in order to define their own social role. The work of the English 
historian Henry Thomas Buckle (1821-1861) proved particularly attractive to members of 
these circles because of its emphasis on scientific method and on the expansion of 
knowledge as the basis of historical development. 

84.A reference to the ideas of Feuerbach (see n. 41 above) as well as to theirextension 
by Chernyshevsky in his important treatise “The Anthropological Principle in Philoso- 
phy” (Sovremennik, no. 4 [1860]; available in English in N. G. Chernyshevsky, Selected 
Philosophical Essays (Moscow, 1953], pp. 49-135). This article provides a theoretical 
statement of both the materialist philosophy and the idea of rational egoism which 
underlie the present novel (on both, see Introduction, pp. 16-19).

walking across it. Her sweetheart says, “You want to know, Aleksei 
Petrovich, why one kind of dirt produces wheat that’s so white, tender, 
and pure, while another kind doesn’t.36 Soon you'll come to under- 
stand the difference yourself. Look at the root of this fine stalk: there’s 
dirt all around it, but it’s fresh dirt, one might even say ‘clean dirt.’ 
Smell it: it's damp and unpleasant, but it’s neither moldy nor putrid. 
You know that in the language of the philosophy to which we both 
subscribe®’ this ‘clean dirt’ is called ‘real dirt.’ It’s ‘dirty,’ to be sure; but 
if you look at it carefully, you'll see that all its elements are healthy in 
and of themselves. They constitute ‘dirt’ in this particular combina- 
tion, but if the arrangement of atoms were to be slightly altered, some- 
thing else would emerge. And that new substance would also be 
healthy because the basic elements are sound. Where does the healthy 
quality of this dirt come from? Observe the condition of this field: you 
can see that there is ample drainage for the water. Consequently, there 
can be no stagnation.” 

“Yes, movement is reality,” replies Aleksei Petrovich, “because move- 
ment is life; reality and life are one and the same. But life has as its 
main element labor; consequently, the main element of reality is labor, 
and the truest sign of reality is activity.’ 

“So you see, Aleksei Petrovich, when the sun begins to warm this dirt 
and that warmth begins to rearrange the elements into more complex 
chemical combinations, that is, into those characteristic of higher 
forms, then the stalk that grows in this dirt with the help of sunlight 
will be healthy.” 

“Yes, because it’s the dirt of real life,” says Aleksei Petrovich. 

“Now let's cross over to this other field. Let’s pull up a plant and 
examine its root. It’s also ‘dirty.’ Note its character: it’s not difficult to 
observe that this dirt is rotten.” 

“That is, it's phantasmic dirt, according to scientific terminology,” 
says Aleksei Petrovich. 

“Indeed. Its elements are in an unhealthy condition. Moreover, it’s 
only natural that no matter how they might be rearranged, and what- 
ever substances unlike dirt might emerge from these very same ele- 
ments, they'd still be unhealthy and rotten.” 


86. In Vera's dream Chernyshevsky uses Liebig's theories regarding the fertility of 
different types of soil (see n. 82 above) to expound his own idea that socioeconomic 
conditions shape an individual's character, and that therefore the revolutionary trans- 
formation of these conditions will ensure social justice and prosperity by fostering 
appropriate personality traits. By linking the biblical parable of the sower (Luke 8:8) with 
Liebig's theories on soil chemistry, he is also trying to provide scientific proof for the 
utopian as well as Christian idea of transformation. In chap. 6 of his novel Fathers and 
Sons (see n. 147 below and Introduction, pp. 26-27), Turgenev has the ineffectual liberal 
Pavel Kirsanov seek the advice of his nihilist hero, Bazarov, regarding the usefulness of 
Liebig's discoveries. 

87. That is, materialism. 


182 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Yes, because the elements themselves are unhealthy,” says Aleksei 
Petrovich. 

“It won't be hard to discover the cause of this unhealthiness.” 

“That is, the cause of this phantasmic stagnation,” says Aleksei Pe- 
trovich. 

“Yes, of the stagnation of these elements; we need only observe the 
condition of this field. You see, the water has no outlet; therefore it 
stagnates and putrefies.” 

“Yes, the absence of movement is the absence of labor,” says Aleksei 
Petrovich," because in an anthropological analysis88 labor constitutes 
the fundamental form of movement which provides the basis and 
content of all other forms: recreation, relaxation, amusement, enjoy- 
ment. Without labor to precede them, these other forms have no real- 
ity. And without movement there’s no life, that is, no reality, because 
the dirt is phantasmic, putrid. Until very recently no one knew how to 
restore such fields to health; but now a method has been discovered. 
It's called ‘drainage.’*9 Excess water is channeled off into ditches, leav- 
ing only the required amount. And this water is kept in motion; thus 
the field acquires its reality. But until this method is applied, the dirt 
remains phantasmic, that is, stagnant; it can’t produce any healthy 
vegetation. Meanwhile, as expected, healthy plants appear in the real 
dirt, since it’s healthy. ‘That which was to be proved . . ’ Q.E.D., as it’s 
said in Latin.”9° 

Precisely how “that which was to be proved” is said in Latin, Vera 
Pavlovna was unable to make out. 

“Aleksei Petrovich, you do enjoy amusing yourself with low Latin 
and syllogisms,” says her sweetheart, that is, her husband. 

Vera Pavlovna goes up to both of them and says, “Enough of your 
analyses, identities, and anthropologisms. Gentlemen, please talk 
about something else so I can participate in your conversation; or 
better still, let’s play a game.” 

“Yes, let's,” says Aleksei Petrovich. “Let’s play confession.” 

“Oh, yes, let’s. That will be great fun,” says Vera Pavlovna. “Since you 
suggested it, show us how it’s done.” 

“With pleasure, my ‘sister,’” says Aleksei Petrovich. “But first, how 
old are you, my dear sister? Eighteen?” 

“Almost nineteen.” 


88. See n. 84 above. 

89. An allegory for revolution (see n. 86 above). In the Aesopian language employed 
during this period to avoid tsarist censorship, Russian radicals referred to mechanical 
processes such as “drainage” to indicate revolutionary means of change and chemical 
processes to signify evolutionary change. Thus Chernyshevsky's emphasis on drainage 
rather than on chemical improvement indicates his advocacy of revolution. 

90. Quod erat demonstrandum (Lat.), “which was to be proved.” 


What Is to Be Done? 183 


“But not quite. Therefore, let’s say eighteen. We'll all confess up to 
that age, since we must maintain equality in all conditions of the 
game. I'll confess for both myself and my wife. My father was a sexton 
in the main town of our province; he was also a bookbinder. My 
mother rented rooms to seminary students. Day and night my parents 
talked and worried about how to provide our daily bread. My father 
was inclined to drink, but only when our situation became intolerable 
(and that was genuine sorrow), or when his income would permit. He 
would turn over all his money to my mother, saying, ‘Well, my dear, 
now we won't have to struggle for the next two months. So I've left 
myself half a ruble and will have a drink in celebration’ (and that was 
genuine joy). My mother would often get angry; sometimes she even 
beat me, but only, as she used to say, when her back ached from 
carrying heavy kettles and pots, washing clothes for the five of us plus 
five seminary students, scrubbing the floors dirtied by our twenty feet 
(which didn’t wear galoshes), and taking care of our cow. This was 
genuine nervous distress caused by too much work and lack of rest. 
And when, for all that, ‘ends didn’t meet,’ as she used to say—that is, 
when there wasn’t enough money to buy boots for one of my brothers 
or shoes for one of my sisters—then she used to beat us. She also used 
to hug us when we, foolish kids that we were, would offer to help her 
with her work, when we did something clever, or when she had a rare 
moment to relax and her ‘back pain had eased,’ as she used to say. 
Those were genuine joys." 

“Oh, enough of your genuine joys and sorrows,” says Vera Pavlovna. 

“In that case, you'll now hear Natasha's confession from me.” 

“I don't want to listen. I knowit'll have the same sort of genuine joys 
and sorrows.” 

“That's absolutely true.” 

“Perhaps you'd be interested in hearing my confession,” says Serge, 
appearing from God knows where. 

“All right, let’s hear it,” says Vera Pavlovna. 

“My father and mother, even though they were well off, also talked 
and worried about money constantly. Even rich people aren't free of 
such worries.” 

“You don't know how to confess, Serge,” says Aleksei Petrovich po- 
litely. “Tell us why they worried about money, what kind of expenses 
concerned them, which needs they were hard-pressed to satisfy.” 

“Yes, of course, I understand why you're asking,” says Serge. “But 
let's leave that topic and turn to another. They also worried about their 
children.” 

“But were their children assured of receiving their daily bread?” asks 
Aleksei Petrovich. 


184 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Of course, but they had to worry about .. .” 

“Don’t confess, Serge,” says Aleksei Petrovich. “We know your whole 
story: concern for the superfluous, worry about the unnecessary— 
that's the soil that produced you. It was phantasmic. Therefore, take a 
good look at youself; you weren't born a stupid man. You seem to be 
very good, perhaps neither worse nor less intelligent than we are. But 
what good are you? Of what use are you?” 

“I'm good for escorting Julie wherever she wants to go and I’m of use 
so that she can carouse,” answers Serge. 

“We see, then, as a result,” says Aleksei Petrovich, “that phantasmic 
or unhealthy soil .. .” 

“Oh, I'm so fed up with your realities and phantasms! Their meaning 
has been clear for ages, yet still you go on explaining!” says Vera 
Pavlovna. 

“Wouldn't you like to have a little chat with me?” asks Marya Alek- 
sevna, who’s also appeared from God knows where. “Gentlemen, 
please leave us alone. A mother would like to speak with her daugh- 
ter.” 

Everyone disappears. Now Verochka sees herself all alone with Mar- 
ya Aleksevna. Her mother’s face assumes a sarcastic expression. 

“So, Vera Pavlovna, you’re an educated lady now, so pure and no- 
ble,” says Marya Aleksevna, her voice shaking with rage. “You’re so 
kind. How can I, a vulgar, mean drunkard, possibly speak to you? You 
have a nasty, wicked mother, Vera Pavlovna. But allow me to inquire, 
madame, what it was that your mother was always so concerned 
about? Providing for your daily bread! And in your opinion, in your 
learned opinion, this is a genuine, real human concern, is it not? You 
heard abusive language and you saw wickedness and meanness. But 
permit me to inquire, what purpose did it serve? Was it for nothing, for 
some trifle? No, madame! No, indeed! Whatever life your family led, it 
wasn't an empty, phantasmic one. You see, Vera Pavlovna, I've learned 
to speak just like you, using that scientific language. But now, Vera 
Pavlovna, are you distressed and ashamed that your mother is such a 
nasty, vile woman? Would you prefer it if I were kind and honest? I'ma 
witch, Vera Pavlovna; I can cast spells and can grant your wish. Be so 
good as to observe, my dear, how your wish is now being granted: your 
wicked mother is now disappearing. Behold your good, kind mother 
and her daughter.” 

Vera Pavlovna sees a room. A drunken, unshaven, disgusting man 
lies snoring near the threshold. It's impossible to see who he is, as his 
face is half shielded by his arm, half covered with bruises. There 
stands a bed. A woman is lying on it. Yes, it's Marya Aleksevna, only 
now she’s so kind! But how pale her face is, how decrepit she is at age 


What Is to Be Done? 185 


forty-five, how exhausted! Near the bed stands a young girl of about 
eighteen. Yes, it’s I, Verochka—except I’m all in rags. And what's this? 
My complexion is sallow, my features are gross, and the room is bar- 
ren. There’s hardly any furniture in it. “Verochka, my dear, my angel,” 
says Marya Aleksevna, “lie down and rest, my treasure. Why are you 
looking at me? I'll just lie here by myself. But you haven't slept for 
three nights.” 

“Never mind, mama, I'm not tired,” says Verochka. 

“You know, I'm not feeling any better, Verochka. How will you man- 
age without me? Your father’s income is so meager; he can't support 
you. You're an attractive girl; there are many wicked people in the 
world. There'll be no one to protect you. How] fear for you!” Verochka 
weeps. 

“Don't be offended, my dear. I’m not saying this to reproach you, but 
to warn you. Why did you go out on Friday, a day before I fell ill?” 
Verochka weeps. 

“He'll deceive you, Verochka. Give him up.” 

“No, mama.” 

Two months later. How can it be that in one brief moment two 
months have passed? On a chair sits an officer. A bottle stands on the 
table before him. Verochka is sitting on his lap. 

Another two months pass by in an instant. 

A lady is sitting on a sofa. Verochka stands before her. 

“Do you know how to iron, my dear?” 

‘I do.” 

“What are you, my dear? A serf or a free woman?” 

“My father is a civil servant.” 

“Then you belong to the nobility, my dear. In that case, I'm afraid I 
can't hire you. What sort of servant would you make? Go away, dear, I 
can’t use you.” 

Verochka is out on the street. 

“Mamzelle, hey, mamzelle,” says some tipsy young man. “Where to? 
I'll go with you!” Verochka runs toward the banks of the Neva.9! 

“Well, my dear, have you seen enough of what it would be like to 
have a kind mother?” asks the former Marya Aleksevna, the real one. 
“I’m good at casting spells, aren't 1? Haven't I figured it all out very 
well? Why have you fallen silent? Don't you have a tongue? I'll squeeze 
the words out of you! Hey, it’s hard to get anything out! Well, have you 
been out shopping?” 

“Yes, I have,” replies Verochka, trembling.

“And have you seen and heard?” 

“Yes, I have.” 

“Do they live well, all those learned types? They read books and 
devise new worlds where people do what’s good. They do, don’t they? 
Speak!” 

Verochka remains silent, trembling. 

“Hey, I can't get a peep out of you! Do they live well, I'm asking you!” 

Verochka remains silent and feels a cold shudder. 

“Not a peep! Do they live well, I ask you! Are they good people? Do 
you want to become like them? Silence. Don’t turn your mug away! 
You listen to me, Verka,%* listen to what I have to say. You're learned 
now, educated with money that I stole. You dream about the good, but 
if I hadn’t been so wicked, you wouldn’t even know what the good is! 
Do you understand? Everything comes from me! You are my daughter, 
understand? J am your mother.” Verochka weeps, trembles, and shud- 
ders. 

“Mama, what do you want from me? I can’t love you.” 

“Am I asking you to love me?” 

“At least I'd like to respect you, but I can’t.” 

“Do I need your respect?” 

“Well, then, what is it, mama? Why have you come to talk to me and 
terrify me? What do you want from me?” 

“Be grateful, you ingrate. Don’t love me or respect me. I'm evil: how 
can you love me? I'm nasty: how can you respect me? But you must 
understand, Verka, that if I hadn’t been who I was, then you wouldn’t 
be who you are. I was nasty, but you are good. I was wicked, but you 
are kind. Understand, Verka, and be grateful.” 

“Go away now, Marya Aleksevna. I'd like a word with my little sister.” 

Marya Aleksevna disappears. 

The Bride of her Bridegrooms, the Sister of her Sisters now takes 
Verochka by the hand. 

“I have always wanted to be kind to you, Verochka, since you're so 
kind yourself, and I always resemble the person with whom I'm speak- 
ing. But now you're very sad, and you see, so am I. Look, am I attractive 
in my sadness?” 

“More attractive than anyone in the whole world.” 

“Kiss me, Verochka. We're both in distress. You know, your mother 
was telling you the truth. I don’t love her, but I do need her.” 

“Can’t you do without her?” 

“Later it will be possible, when people no longer need to be wicked. 
But for now it isn’t. You see, good people are unable to stand on their

own two feet; the wicked are clever and strong. You see, Verochka, 
there are different kinds of wicked people. Some want things to get 
worse, others better—all to further their own interests. Your mother 
needed you to become educated. She took all the money that you were 
paid for giving lessons. She wanted her daughter to land a rich son-in- 
law; therefore it was necessary for you to be cultured. You see, she had 
nasty thoughts, but advantages resulted from them. Didn't you get any 
benefits? But this isn’t necessarily the case with all wicked people. If 
your mother had been Anna Petrovna, would you have studied so 
much, become so educated, learned to recognize and cherish the 
good? No, you would never have been allowed to perceive it. They 
would have made a plaything out of you, a doll. Isn't that so? Such a 
mother needs a doll for a daughter, because she’s one herself and 
plays with other dolls. Your mother is a mean person, but she’s still a 
person, and it was important to her that you be more than a doll. You 
see how diverse wicked people are! Some of them interfere with my 
work; I want young men and women to develop and become people, 
they want them to remain dolls. Other wicked people assist me: they 
don’t actually want to help, but in providing young men and women 
with an opportunity to develop, they are in fact amassing the means 
that enable them to do so. And that’s all that I really need. Yes, Ver- 
ochka, now I can’t do without these evil people to oppose the other 
type. My wicked people are very wicked indeed, but good grows up 
beneath their hands. Yes, Verochka, be grateful to your mother. Don’t 
love her, for she is evil; but you owe her everything. Acknowledge it: 
without her, you would not exist.” 

“And will it always be so? It won't, will it?” 

“No, Verochka, it won't be so later. When the good are strong, I won't 
need the wicked. This will happen very soon, Verochka. Then the 
wicked will see that they can no longer be wicked. Those who were 
already developing will become good, since they remained wicked 
only because it was disadvantageous for them to become good. Since 
they know that good is better than evil, they'll come to love the good as 
soon as it’s possible to do so without harming themselves.” 

“And what will become of the wicked who were dolls? I pity even 
them.” 

“They will still play with dolls, but with harmless ones. And you see, 
they won't bear children who take after themselves. Soon all people 
will become developed. I shall teach their children to become people, 
not dolls.” 

“Oh, how wonderful that will be!” 

“Yes, but even now it’s good because the process has already begun. 
At least it’s good for those who are helping to bring it about. Verochka, 


188 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


when you help the cook prepare dinner, even though the kitchen is 
stuffy and smoky, you feel just fine. What do you care if it’s stuffy and 
smoky? Everyone enjoys sitting down to dinner, but the person who 
helped in the preparations enjoys it most of all and finds it twice as 
delicious! You like sweets, don’t you, Verochka?” 

“Yes, I do,” she replies, smiling to find herself accused of liking 
sweets and of helping to make them in the kitchen. 

“Then why are you still so sad? Oh, but you aren’t any longer.” 

“You're so kind!” 

“And cheerful, Verochka, I'm always cheerful, even when I'm sad. 
Aren't I?” 

“Yes, whenever I feel sad, you appear to be sad too, but you always 
drive my grief away at once. I always become cheerful when I’m with 
you, so very cheerful.” 

“Do you remember my little song, ‘Donc vivons’?”93 

“I do.” 

“Well, then, let's sing it.” 

“All right.” 

“Verochka! Did I awaken you? In any case, tea’s ready. I was begin- 
ning to get worried; I heard you moaning, but when I came in, you 
were already singing.” 

“No, my dear, you didn’t wake me. I would have awakened by my- 
self. What a dream I just had, my dear! I'll tell you about it over tea. Run 
along now so I can get dressed. By the way, Dmitry Sergeich, how dare 
you enter my room without permission? You forget yourself. Were you 
worried about me, my dear? Come here, I shall give you a kiss for that. 
There, now that I’ve kissed you, run along, go on, for I must get 
dressed.” 

“So be it, but let me serve as your maid.” 

“Well, all right, dear, but it’s so embarrassing!” 


iv. 


Vera Pavlovna’s dressmaking shop was quickly established. The 
basic principles were simple, in fact so simple in the beginning that 
there really isn’t much to be said about them. Vera Pavlovna told the 
first three seamstresses nothing more than that she would pay them 
slightly higher wages than they would have received at other shops. 
There was nothing special about the business. The seamstresses real- 
ized that Vera Pavlovna was neither an idle woman nor a frivolous one; 


93. See n. 5 above. 


What Is to Be Done? 189 


therefore they accepted her offer to work in the shop without hesita- 
tion. The fact that a woman of modest means wanted to establish a 
dressmaking shop was no cause to hesitate. These three young wom- 
en found three or four more, choosing them carefully, as Vera Pavlovna 
had requested. Nor was there anything special, anything that might 
arouse suspicion in these conditions of choice. A modest young wom- 
an wants all the workers in her shop to be straightforward and of good 
character, reasonable and easy to get along with. What’s so unusual 
about that? She doesn’t want any quarrels, and that’s that; therefore, 
she was behaving sensibly, no more and no less. Vera Pavlovna got very 
well acquainted with the newly chosen girls before she told them that 
they were accepted; that’s only natural. It also shows her to be a 
woman of good common sense, and that’s that. There’s nothing to 
ponder, nothing to distrust. 

Thus they worked for about a month for the agreed-upon wages. 
Vera Pavlovna was constantly in the shop and they got to know her 
well. For all her goodness, they saw that she was also an economical, 
careful, and reasonable woman; thus she earned their complete confi- 
dence. Nor was there anything special about this either; the only thing 
one could say was that she was a good employer whose business was 
doing well. She knew how to run it. 

But when the month was over Vera Pavlovna walked into the shop 
carrying some kind of account book and asked the seamstresses to 
stop their work and listen to what she had to say. In very simple terms 
she began to explain extremely comprehensible things, but things the 
seamstresses had never before heard from her or from anyone else. 

“Now that we know each other well,” she began, “I can say that you 
are good workers and good girls. And you probably wouldn't say that 
I'm some sort of fool. That means that I can speak with you frankly 
about my ideas. If anything seems strange about them, you'll think it 
over carefully and won't say right away that my ideas are stupid, 
because you already know that I'm not a foolish woman. Here are my 
ideas. 

“Good people have said that dressmaking establishments can be 
organized so as to make them much more profitable for seamstresses 
to work in than the ones we now know. I would like to try. Judging by 
the first month, it seems entirely possible to me. You've been receiving 
your wages regularly. Now I'll tell you how much money I have left 
over as profit after paying your wages and all other expenses.” Vera 
Pavlovna read out the amount of income and expenses for the whole 
month. Under expenses, beside wages paid out, were all the other 
costs: rent for the rooms, light, even a ruble or so which Vera Pavlovna 
paid for a cab while on business for the shop. 


190 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“You see,” she continued, “I have this amount of money left over. 
Now, what shall we do with it? I established the workshop so that 
profits would go into the hands of the seamstresses themselves for the 
work they've done. Therefore I’m distributing the money among you. 
This first time each of you will get an equal share. Later on, we'll see if 
that’s the best way to divide it, or if there isn’t another, more advan- 
tageous way.” She distributed the money. 

For a while the seamstresses were so astonished that they were 
unable to come to their senses; then they began to thank her. Vera 
Pavlovna allowed them to express their gratitude for the money to 
their hearts’ content, so as not to offend them by refusing to listen and 
by appearing indifferent to their opinions and inclinations. Then she 
continued. 

“Now I must tell you the most difficult thing of all that I will ever 
have to say. I don’t even know if I can explain it very well. Nevertheless, 
I must say it. Why haven't I kept the money myself? Why would I want 
to establish a workshop if I wasn't going to keep the income from it? As 
you know, my husband and [ are in no great need. We're not rich, but 
we have enough to live on. If I felt the lack of anything, I'd only have to 
tell my husband—no, I wouldn’t even have to do that. He himself 
would notice that I needed more money, and I would have more. Now 
he’s occupied not with those things that are most profitable, but with 
those he likes best. But we love each other very much, and he always 
wants to do what will make me happy, just as I do for him. Therefore, if 
I lacked money, he would pursue a more profitable occupation than 
his present one. He would manage to find something, because he’s 
such a clever and resourceful man. But you know him alittle. If he isn’t 
doing that, then it means the money we have is enough for me. And 
that’s because I have no great passion for money. You know that 
people have different passions, not all of them only for money. Some 
like to go to balls, others like to wear fine clothes or play cards. All 
these people are prepared to ruin themselves for their passions, and 
many do. No one is surprised that they hold these passions dearer 
than money. It happens to be my passion to set up this enterprise with 
you. And not only won't I ruin myself with my passion, but I don’t even 
spend any money on it. I’m only pleased to be able to do it, even if I 
earn nothing myself. I see nothing unusual in this. Who expects to 
earn any income from his passion? Most people spend their money on 
it. But I'm not going to do that. In other words, I enjoy an advantage 
over others because I can indulge my passion and take pleasure in it 
while incurring no loss, while others have to pay for their pleasure. 
Why do I have this passion? Here’s why. Many good, clever people 
have written books on the subject of how one should live on this earth 


What Is to Be Done? 191 


so that all people may be happy. According to them, the most impor- 
tant thing is to organize workshops according to a new system."4 I'd 
like to see if together we can establish the new system they prescribe. 
It’s the same as wanting to build a fine house, plant a nice garden, or 
erect a greenhouse for one’s own enjoyment. I want to organize a nice 
sewing shop so that I may enjoy it. 

“Of course, it would be fine if I did nothing else every month except 
distribute the profits among you as I do now. But clever people say 
that there’s a much better way of doing it so that we receive even 
higher profits and make better use of them. They say that things can 
be organized very well. So we'll see. Little by little I'll tell you what else 
we can do according to the ideas of these clever people, and you 
yourselves should keep watch and take notice. If it occurs to you that 
something can be done better, we'll try that too, gradually, as best we 
can. But I can assure you that I won't organize anything new without 
your participation. The only changes will be those that you yourselves 
want. Clever people have said that things turn out well only if people 
themselves desire it. That’s what I think, too. So you've no need to fear 
anything new; everything will continue to be done in the same way 
unless you wish to change it. Nothing will be changed without your 
consent. 

“And here’s my last pronouncement as owner, made without your 
advice. You see that accounts must be kept and care must be taken so 
that we have no unnecessary expenses. Last month I did it alone; I no 
longer want to do that. Choose two of you who can work together with 
me. I'll do nothing without them. It’s your money, not mine; therefore, 
you must look after it. This enterprise is still new and we don’t know 
yet which of you is best suited to this task, so at first you must choose 
people for a short term. In a week you'll see whether you should 
choose someone else or leave those two in the position.” 

These extraordinary words aroused lengthy debate. But Vera Pavlov- 
na had already obtained their confidence; she spoke very simply, with- 
out looking too far ahead and without painting alluring prospects that, 
after momentary ecstasy, would engender distrust. Therefore, the girls 
didn't think that she was mad, and that was essential. The enterprise 
proceeded apace. 

Of course it did. Here's a brief history of the workshop over the next 
three years, during which it constituted the principal feature of Vera 
Pavlovna’s own personal history. 


94. The cooperative forms of labor advocated by such utopian socialists as Charles 
Fourier, Victor Considérant (see nn. 39 and 40 above), and, especially, Louis Blanc (1811— 
1882), a French journalist and political activist who figured prominently in the revolu- 
tionary events of 1848 in France and whose work Chernyshevsky respected greatly. 


192 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


The girls from whom the nucleus of the workshop was formed were 
chosen very carefully; they were good seamstresses and had a direct 
interest in the success of the enterprise. Therefore, it was only natural 
that the work proceeded well. The workshop didn't lose a single cus- 
tomer who had ever entrusted an order to it. A certain amount of envy 
was manifested by other shops and sewing establishments, but this 
had no real impact except that in order to curtail their nagging, Vera 
Pavlovna soon found it necessary to obtain the right to display a sign 
above her workshop. Soon they began to receive more orders than the 
girls who'd originally entered the workshop could handle, and their 
number began to increase gradually. In a year and a half almost twenty 
girls were employed, later even more. 

One of the first consequences of giving a vote in managing the whole 
enterprise to the girls themselves was a decision that could have been 
expected. During the first month of self-management the girls decided 
that it wouldn't do for Vera Pavlovna to work without compensation. 
When they informed her, she said that they were right. They wanted to 
give her one-third of the profits. For a while she put that amount aside 
until she could convince the girls that this contradicted the basic idea 
of their system. They couldn’t understand this for quite a long time. At 
last they came to realize that Vera Pavlovna had refused a special share 
of the profits not out of any sense of pride but only because the nature 
of the enterprise demanded it. By this time the workshop had grown 
to such an extent that Vera Pavlovna alone couldn't cope with all the 
cutting, and it was necessary to hire another worker. They paid Vera 
Pavlovna the same wages as the second cutter. The share of the profits 
she’d previously put aside was now returned to the till by her own 
request, minus the wages due her as a cutter. The remainder was used 
to establish a bank. For about a year Vera Pavlovna spent most of her 
day in the workshop and worked no fewer hours than any other girl. 
When she saw the possibility of spending less than a full day there, her 
wages were reduced accordingly. 

How were the profits to be divided? Vera Pavlovna wanted to achieve 
the goal of equal division among all. This was accomplished, but only 
toward the middle of their third year of operation; before then they 
passed through several different stages, starting with a division of the 
profits in proportion to the wages of each. Soon they realized that if a 
girl missed several days of work because of illness or some other valid 
excuse, it wasn’t fair to reduce her share of the profits that resulted not 
from her own labor during those days but from the overall progress of 
their work and the general condition of the shop. Then they agreed 
that the cutters and the girls who received extra wages for delivering 
orders and for performing other duties were already being sufficiently 


What Is to Be Done? 193 


compensated by their individual wages and that it would be unjust for 
them to receive a larger share of the profits as well. The ordinary 
seamstresses who had no extra duties were so modest that they 
wouldn't insist on this, even after they noticed the injustice of the 
previous order, which they'd helped to establish. It was the other girls, 
those with extra duties, who felt the awkwardness of receiving more 
and who refused it, once they came to appreciate the idea of the new 
system. However, it must be said that this temporary modesty (the 
patience of the ones and the refusal of the others) did not represent 
any special feat, given the constant improvement in the affairs of both 
groups. The most difficult thing of all was to develop the idea that the 
ordinary seamstresses should each receive the same share of the prof- 
its, although some managed to earn more wages than others, and that 
those who worked better than others were already being sufficiently 
compensated by receiving higher wages. This was the final change in 
the distribution of profits made in the middle of the third year, after 
the workers understood that receipt of profits is not a reward for the 
skill of individual workers, but rather the result of the general nature of 
the enterprise, its organization and its goal. This goal was the greatest 
possible equality in distribution of the fruits of labor for participants in 
the enterprise, regardless of their personal characteristics. Any profit 
sharing by workers depended precisely on the nature of the work- 
shop. The nature of the workshop, its spirit, and its order consisted in 
the unanimity of all; to achieve this unanimity, each participant was 
equally important. The tacit consent of the most timid or the least 
talented was no less essential in the maintenance and development of 
the enterprise for the general good and success of the whole than the 
active zeal of the liveliest or most talented. 

I choose to omit many details here, because I’m not really describ- 
ing the workshop, merely mentioning it insofar as it's necessary to 
characterize Vera Pavlovna’s activity. If I dwell on some particulars, it’s 
only because I want to show how she led the way step by step, and 
how she patiently, indefatigably, and resolutely maintained her own 
rule: not to issue pronouncements, but to consult, explain, offer coop- 
eration, and assist in carrying out the decisions reached by the entire 
group. 

The profits were divided every month. At first each girl took her full 
share and spent it separately. Each one had her own pressing needs, 
and there was no habit of acting in concert. When, as a result of 
constant participation in the enterprise, they had acquired the habit of 
considering the entire operation of the workshop, Vera Pavlovna di- 
rected their attention to the fact that since the quantity of orders 
varied considerably from month to month, in especially profitable 


194 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


months it might not be such a bad idea to put aside a part of the 
profits to distribute during the less profitable ones. ‘The accounts were 
kept very precisely. ‘The girls knew that if one of them left the work- 
shop, she would receive her fair share of the profits remaining in the 
till without any delay. Therefore they agreed to the proposal. A small 
reserve of capital was formed and it gradually grew. They began to 
seek different ways of using it. From the very beginning they all under- 
stood that it could be used to make loans to those who encountered 
some need for extra cash; no one wanted to charge interest for the use 
of their funds. Less prosperous people believe that the best financial 
assistance is always interest-free. After the establishment of a bank, 
they organized a purchasing agency. The girls found that it was advan- 
tageous to buy tea, coffee, sugar, footwear, and many other things 
through the workshop, which could purchase goods in large volume 
and therefore at cheaper prices. Some time later they went even fur- 
ther. They realized that it might be similarly advantageous to organize 
the purchase of bread and other supplies bought daily in bakeries and 
retail shops. But they immediately realized that to do this, they would 
have to live in the same neighborhood. They began to move in to- 
gether, a few to an apartment, not far from the workshop. Thus they 
were able to organize their own purchasing agency to deal with the 
bakery and other retail shops. Within a year and a half almost all the 
girls lived in one large apartment; they had a common table and they 
purchased their provisions just like a large household. 

Half of the girls were single. Several had older relatives, mothers or 
aunts. Two supported their fathers and many had younger brothers 
and sisters. Three girls were unable to move into the common apart- 
ment because of family ties: one mother was hard to get along with, 
the other was the wife of a civil servant and didn’t want to live with 
peasant girls, and the third had a drunk for a father. They made use 
only of the purchasing agency, just as the married seamstresses did. 
Except for these three, all the other single girls who had relatives to 
support lived in the common apartment. There were two or three to a 
room, and their relatives were settled according to their needs. Two 
older women had separate rooms while the rest lived together. ‘There 
was one room for young boys and two for young girls. It was decided 
that boys could live there only until the age of eight; older boys were 
sent out as apprentices. 

An accurate account was kept of everything so that the entire group 
was of the firm conviction that no one was being offended or exploited 
by anyone else. The charges for room and board for the single girls 
were simple to calculate. After some hesitation they decided to set the 
rate for a brother or sister up to eight years old at one-forth the 


What Is to Be Done? 195 


amount of an adult; girls from eight to twelve were charged one-third, 
and from twelve up, one-half. From the age of thirteen girls became 
apprentices in the workshop unless something else had been ar- 
ranged. It was decided that at sixteen they became full members of the 
group if it was agreed that they had acquired the requisite sewing 
skills. Naturally the charge for adult relatives was the same as that for 
the seamstresses themselves. There was also a special charge for a 
single room. Almost all of the old women and all three of the old men 
who were living in the apartment worked in the kitchen and helped 
with other household chores; of course they were compensated for 
this work. 

All of this can be portrayed in words very quickly; and even in reality 
it all seemed very easy, simple, and natural once it was established. 
However, it was very slow to be organized and each new step was 
accompanied by considerable discussion; every change was the result 
of a whole series of efforts. It would be too long and dry to describe 
other aspects of life in the workshop in as much detail as I’ve devoted 
to the distribution and investment of profits. So as not to weary the 
reader, many things will have to be omitted, while others will be men- 
tioned only briefly. For example, the workshop established its own 
agency for selling ready-made clothes, which were assembled when 
they weren't busy filling private orders. Although they didn’t have a 
separate store, they'd entered into an agreement with one of the shops 
in the Shopping Arcade; they also had a small stand in the flea market 
where two of the old women were in charge. There's one other aspect 
of life in the workshop which must be described in greater detail. 

From the very first Vera Pavlovna had begun to provide books. After 
giving the seamstresses instructions, she began to read aloud to them 
and would continue to do so for half an hour or even an hour, unless 
she was interrupted sooner by the need to provide further instruc- 
tions. Then the girls would get a rest from listening; more reading was 
followed by another rest. Needless to say, from the very beginning the 
girls conceived a liking for reading; some had been avid readers even 
before. Within two or three weeks this reading during work hours had 
become a regular institution. After three or four months several excel- 
lent readers emerged from the group. It was decided that they would 
replace Vera Pavlovna and would read for half an hour each, and this 
time would be counted as part of their work. Once Vera Pavlovna had 
been relieved of her obligation to read aloud, she began to relate more 
tales of her own devising (some of which she'd already done as an 
alternative to reading). Gradually her tales began to resemble light 
lectures on various fields of knowledge. Then—and this was a very 
large step—Vera Pavlovna saw the possibility of establishing a regular 


196 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


course of instruction. The girls were so eager to learn and their work 
was going so well that they decided to take a long break in the middle 
of the day just before dinner to conduct their lessons. 

“Aleksei Petrovich,” said Vera Pavlovna one day during a visit to the 
Mertsalovs, “I have a favor to ask of you. Natasha has already sided 
with me. My workshop is becoming a lycée®S of all kinds of learning. 
Come and be one of our professors.” 

“What would I teach? Latin and Greek, perhaps? Or logic and rhet- 
oric?” asked Aleksei Petrovich with a laugh. “My specialty is not terri- 
bly interesting either to you or to another individual whom I know 
very well.”96 

“But it’s precisely as a specialist that you’re needed. You'll serve as 
our shield of morality and a guarantor of the correct orientation of our 
curriculum.” 

“Now that’s true! I can see that there could be no morality without 
me. Name the subject.” 

“Well, Russian history, for example, or an outline of world history.” 

“Splendid. I'll lecture on that subject and it will be supposed that 
I’m an expert. Excellent. Two occupations: professor and shield.” 

Natalya Andrevna, Lopukhov, two or three students, and Vera Pav- 
lovna herself acted as the other “professors,” as they jokingly referred 
to themselves. 

In addition to instruction, entertainment was arranged. There were 
parties in the evening and outings to the countryside. At first these 
were infrequent; then, when more money became available, they were 
held more often. They rented boxes at the theater. By the third winter 
they bought a subscription for ten inexpensive seats to hear Italian 
opera.97 


There was much joy and happiness for Vera Pavlovna; there was also 
a great deal of work and trouble, even some disappointment. The 
misfortune of one of the finest girls in the workshop made a particular- 
ly strong impression not only on her but on the entire workshop. 
Sashenka Pribytkova, one of the three original seamstresses whom 
Vera Pavlovna had hired, was extremely attractive and very sensitive.

school for children of the social elite. Vera Pavlovna's educational efforts reflect the 
movement to educate adult workers and members of similar urban groups in special 
“Sunday schools” that were organized in several Russian cities during the late 1850s. 
Radical intellectuals often used these schools as a forum for disseminating revolutionary 
ideas.

She was engaged to a nice, kind young man, a civil servant. Once, 
when she was out walking along the street rather late at night, she was 
accosted by some “gentleman.” She quickened her pace. He pursued 
her and seized her hand. She tugged and pulled away, but the move- 
ment of her hand struck his chest and caused this fine gentleman’s 
watch to fall out onto the pavement. This fine gentleman seized Pri- 
bytkova with considerable aplomb and, seized by a sense of his own 
legal rights, he shouted, “Stop, thief! Police!” Two policemen came to 
the scene and carted Pribytkova away to the jail at the police station. 
For three days not a word was heard from her in the workshop and no 
one could imagine what had become of her. On the fourth day a kind 
soldier, one of the attendants at the jail, brought Vera Pavlovna a note 
from Pribytkova. Lopukhov left at once to make inquiries. They were 
very rude to him and he was twice as rude back. Then he went off to 
see Serge. Serge and Julie were out of town at some large affair and 
returned only the next day. Two hours later the district police officer 
apologized to Pribytkova and went to apologize to her fiancé. But he 
couldn't find the young man. He’d been to the jail to see Pribytkova the 
evening before and had found out the gallant’s name from the arrest- 
ing officers. He went to find him and promptly challenged him to a 
duel. Before hearing the challenge, the gallant had apologized for his 
mistake in a rather sarcastic tone; after hearing the challenge, he burst 
out laughing. The civil servant replied, “Surely you won't refuse this 
challenge,” and then slapped his face. The gallant grabbed a stick and 
the civil servant shoved him away. The gallant fell; his servants ran in 
to see what the noise was all about. They found their master lying 
dead on the floor; he'd been knocked down and in falling had struck 
his temple on the sharp end of a carved wooden table leg. The civil 
servant wound up in prison, a criminal action was instigated, and 
there was no end to the matter in sight. What else is there to say? 
Nothing much, except that from then on Pribytkova was a pitiful sight 
to behold. 

There were a few other episodes in the workshop, not of a criminal 
nature, but not very cheerful either. These were ordinary affairs after 
which young girls weep for a good long time, whereas young men or 
middle-aged men have enjoyed a brief but pleasant diversion. Vera 
Pavlovna realized that with prevailing ideas and circumstances, such 
episodes were inevitable; no amount of caution on the girls’ part or 
solicitude by others on the girls’ behalf could succeed in protecting 
them each and every time. It was exactly the same with smallpox in 
days of old, before people learned how to prevent the disease. Now a 
person who suffers from smallpox has only himself to blame, and even 
more those close to him. But that wasn't always so. In the past, there 


198 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


was nothing to blame—except a vile epidemic, a filthy village or town, 
or even another person suffering from the disease who came into 
contact with someone else, rather than locking himself up under quar- 
antine until he recovered. So it is now with these episodes. Someday 
people will be rid of this kind of smallpox as well; the remedy is 
already available,?8 but people still prefer not to swallow it, just as they 
chose not to adopt any cure against smallpox for years and years. Vera 
Pavlovna understood that this foul epidemic was sweeping relentless- 
ly through towns and villages and claiming victims from even the most 
solicitous hands. Still, that’s poor consolation when you know only 
that “I’m not to blame for your misfortune, nor are you, my friend.” 
Nevertheless, each one of these ordinary episodes brought Vera Pav- 
lovna much sorrow and even greater effort. Sometimes she had to go 
in search to render aid; more often she didn’t need to search, just to 
help—to soothe, restore courage, bolster pride, and to explain that “as 
soon as you stop crying, you'll see that there’s really nothing to cry 
about.” 

But much greater, oh, so much greater, were the joys! Except for the 
sorrows, it was all joy. The sorrows were individual and infrequent 
occurrences. Today or in half a year, you start grieving over one, while 
at the same time you rejoice over all the others. And after two or three 
weeks, you can even rejoice over that one. The ordinary course of 
events was bright and cheerful; it constantly filled Vera Pavlovna with 
joy. If the routine was upon occasion grievously broken by sorrows, 
the exceptionally joyous events, which were more frequent than the 
sorrows, more than compensated for them. For example, they would 
succeed in finding an excellent position for the younger brother or 
sister of one of the girls. In the third year two girls passed an exam to 
become private tutors. What good fortune for them! There were several 
similar happy events. The most frequent cause for celebration in the 
whole workshop and the most common source of Vera Pavlovna’s joy 
were the marriages. There were rather a lot of them, all of them good 
matches. Each wedding was arranged with great gaiety. They held 
many evening parties both before and after the event, and the bride-to- 
be received many surprises from her friends in the workshop. They 
were provided with a dowry from the reserve fund. But here again, 
there was much work for Vera Pavlovna; needless to say, she had her 
hands full. At first, Vera Pavlovna did one thing that was considered 
tactless: when the first bride asked her to act as proxy mother during 
the ceremony, Vera Pavlovna refused. The second bride made the 
same request and had the same result. Most often Natasha Mertsalova 


98. Another allegorical allusion to the revolutionary transformation of society. 


What Is to Be Done? 199 


acted as proxy mother, or even Natasha’s mother, who was also a very 
fine woman, but never Vera Pavlovna. She would dress the bride and 
escort her to the church, but only as one of her friends. The first time 
the girls thought that her refusal indicated some sort of displeasure; 
but that wasn’t it. Vera Pavlovna was pleased to be asked, but wouldn't 
agree to the request. The second time they realized that it was simply 
her modesty. Vera Pavlovna didn’t want to appear as the official patro- 
ness of the bride. In general she avoided any form of influence; she 
tried to push others to the forefront and succeeded in doing so. Many 
ladies who came into the workshop with orders were unable to distin- 
guish her from the two other cutters. But Vera Pavlovna took the great- 
est possible pleasure in the workshop when explaining to someone 
that the entire system was organized and maintained by the girls 
themselves. With these explanations she was trying to convince herself 
of what she wanted to believe; namely, that the workshop could func- 
tion without her, that other workshops of the same sort could appear 
completely independent of theirs, even—Why not? It would be splen- 
did! Best of all!—even without any supervision from someone outside 
the seamstresses’ ranks, but entirely as a result of the ideas and skills 
of the seamstresses themselves. That was Vera Pavlovna's fondest 
dream. 


Vv. 


And thus almost three years have passed since the establishment of 
the workshop, more than three since Vera Pavlovna’s wedding. How 
quietly and actively have these years gone by, how full of serenity, joy, 
and all good things they were! 

Upon awakening, Vera Pavlovna lies in bed for a long time luxuriat- 
ing; she loves to do so. It’s as if she were dozing a bit, but not quite, 
thinking about what she has to do. So she lies there, not quite dozing 
and not quite thinking. Yes, she is thinking: “How warm, soft, nice, and 
splendid to luxuriate in the morning.” And so she does, until from the 
neutral room (no, we must say one of the neutral rooms, since there 
are now two in this, the fourth year of their marriage) her husband, 
that is, her “dearest,” says, “Verochka, are you awake?” “Yes, my dear- 
est.” That means that her husband can make the tea, as he does every 
morning, while Vera Pavlovna (no, in her own room she's Verochka, 
not Vera Pavlovna) starts to get dressed. How long it takes her! No, she 
gets dressed quickly, in a minute or so, but she spends a long time 
splashing in the basin (she so enjoys splashing) and brushing her hair. 
No, it’s not the brushing that takes time; she does that in one minute; 


200 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


she spends a long time playing with her hair because she loves it so. 
Moreover, she sometimes spends a very long time on one particular 
item in her wardrobe—her shoes. She has wonderful shoes. In gener- 
al, her wardrobe is very modest, but shoes are her passion. 

Now she’s come out to drink her tea. She embraces her husband 
and asks, “How did you sleep, my dear?” During tea she chats with 
him about various matters, both trivial and serious. However, Vera 
Pavlovna (no, Verochka . . . at morning tea she’s still Verochka) doesn’t 
drink tea as much as she drinks cream. Tea is merely a pretext for 
cream, which fills more than half her cup, since cream is also her 
passion. It’s hard to get good cream in Petersburg, but Verochka man- 
ages to find the real, unadulterated stuff. She dreams of having their 
own cow; well, if things continue as they have been going, it might 
even be possible in a year or so. 

But now it’s ten o'clock. Her “dearest” goes off to his lessons or to 
work. He’s employed in a manufacturer's office. Vera Pavlovna (now 
she’s definitely Vera Pavlovna until the next morning) attends to her 
household chores. She has only one servant, a young girl, who has to 
be shown everything. As soon as she's been trained, you have to start 
all over again. Vera Pavlovna can’t keep servants for very long; they go 
off and get married. Within half a year or so you'll see Vera Pavlovna 
making herself a cape or a pair of cuffs to act as proxy mother at 
another wedding. She can no longer refuse: “But Vera Pavlovna, you 
arranged it all! There’s no one else besides you.” 

Yes, there are many household chores. Then she sets off for her own 
lessons—rather a lot, about ten hours a week. More would be difficult 
to handle, and she hardly has enough time. Before the lessons she 
spends rather a long time in the workshop; after returning from the 
lessons, she must look in again. Then there’s dinner with her “dear- 
est.” They quite often have guests—one, more often two, but no more 
than that. Even when there are two guests it entails sufficient labor: 
preparing an extra dish so that there’ll be enough food to go around. If 
Vera Pavlovna is tired when she returns, dinner is simple. She sits in 
her own room resting before dinner. The meal is one she’s helped with 
earlier, but it’s completed without her. If she isn’t tired when she 
comes home, then things really start happening in the kitchen. A 
special dish appears at the table, some kind of pastry, more often than 
not something eaten with cream—that is, something to serve as a 
pretext for eating cream. 

During dinner Vera Pavlovna talks and asks questions; she usually 
talks more than she asks. And how could it be otherwise? There’s so 
much news to report just about the workshop alone! After dinner she 
sits with her dearest for another quarter of an hour. Then it’s good- 


What Is to Be Done? 201 


bye, and they retire to their own rooms. Once again Vera Pavlovna lies 
on her bed, reading and luxuriating. She often takes a little nap, even 
very often; as much as half the time she dozes for an hour or an hour 
and a half. This is her weakness, almost a vulgar one, but Vera Pavlovna 
naps after dinner whenever she can. She loves it, feeling neither shame 
nor remorse at this vulgar habit. She gets up after sleeping or lounging 
for an hour and a half or even two hours; then she gets dressed and 
returns to the workshop, where she remains until teatime. If there are 
no guests coming that evening, she chats with her dearest, spending a 
half hour or so in the neutral room. Then it’s “Good night, my dearest”; 
they kiss and part until tea the following morning. Then Vera Pavlovna 
works, sometimes until very late, almost two in the morning, reading 
or resting from her reading at the piano in her own room. The piano 
was purchased not that long ago; before that they'd rented one. It was 
quite an event when they purchased their own piano. It proved to be 
cheaper, too. It was bought by chance for only a hundred rubles. It 
was a little old Erard,99 and all the necessary repairs cost only another 
seventy rubles. But it produces an excellent sound. Occasionally her 
dearest would come to hear her singing, but only occasionally. He had 
a great deal of work to do. Thus they passed the evening: working, 
reading, playing, and singing—but reading and singing most of all. 

That's when there were no guests. But very often they had guests in 
the evening—young people for the most part, younger than her dear- 
est, and younger than Vera Pavlovna herself. Among them were also 
the teachers from the workshop. They have a great deal of respect for 
Lopukhov and consider him one of the best minds in Petersburg. 
Perhaps they aren’t mistaken at all, and their real tie with Lopukhov 
consists in the fact that they find it useful to converse with him.1° 
They share unlimited veneration for Vera Pavlovna; she even allows 
them to kiss her hand without feeling any humiliation. She behaves as 
if she were fifteen years older than they are, that is, if she’s not being 
silly. But, to tell the truth, she usually acts very silly, running around 
and playing along with them. Theyre delighted: they dance a galop or 
a waltz, chase each other about, play the piano, chat and laugh, but 
most of all, they sing. But all this chasing, laughter, and everything else 
in no way prevent these young people from idolizing Vera Pavlovna 
totally, unconditionally, and boundlessly. They respect her more than 
most people respect their older sisters, as even a good mother isn't

always respected. Moreover, the songs they sing aren't pure nonsense, 
although sometimes there’s some of that, too.!°! For the most part 
Vera Pavlovna performs serious songs; at times she plays serious mu- 
sic without singing, and her listeners sit in silence. 

Rather often the Lopukhovs entertain older guests, about their own 
age. For the most part they are Dmitry’s former colleagues and their 
acquaintances, two or three young professors, almost all unmarried. 
The Mertsalovs are almost the only married visitors. The Lopukhovs 
don't go visiting all that often, and almost solely to the Mertsalovs or to 
Natasha's parents. These kind and simple old folks have a large num- 
ber of sons who occupy respectable positions in various departments. 
Thus Vera Pavlovna gets to see a rather broad and diverse society in 
their comfortable home. 

Vera Pavlovna really enjoys this free, open, and active life, which is 
not without its sybaritic side—luxuriating in her soft, warm bed, as 
well as savoring real cream and pastries with cream. 

Can life really be any better in this world? Vera Pavlovna thinks not. 

Yes, and for soneone in her early youth it could scarcely be better. 

But years pass, and as they do, life gets continually better if it goes 
on as it should and as it does now among a very few. Someday it will 
be like that for everyone.

One day toward the end of summer the girls had gathered in their 
customary fashion for a Sunday outing in the country. During the 
summer they went out to the islands in boats almost every holiday.!°2 
Vera Pavlovna usually went along with them; this time Dmitry Sergeich 
was coming too, which is why the outing was to be so special. His 
company was a rarity: it was only the second time that summer he was 
going along with them. When the girls in the workshop heard the good 
news, they were very pleased. Vera Pavlovna would be even more 
cheerful than usual and one could expect that the outing would be 
very, very lively. A few girls who'd been planning to spend Sunday 
elsewhere changed their plans and joined those preparing to go on 
the outing. They had to take five large dinghies instead of four, and 
even that turned out to be insufficient, so they took six. The group 
consisted of some fifty people or more: over twenty seamstresses (only 
six didn’t participate), three older women, a dozen or so children, the 


101. An allusion to such revolutionary songs as La Marseillaise (see n. 5 above). 
102. Several of the islands in the Neva estuary became favorite recreational spots for 
the inhabitants of St. Petersburg. 


What Is to Be Done? 203 


seamstresses' mothers, sisters, and brothers, three young suitors (one 
was a watchmaker's apprentice, the second a merchant, and neither of 
them yielded an inch in manners to the third, a teacher in the district 
school), five or six other young men of diverse callings including even 
two officers, and eight or nine students from either the university or 
the Medical Academy. They took along four big samovars, great piles of 
baked goods, and huge amounts of cold veal and similar supplies. 
These people were young; there would be plenty of activity in the fresh 
air, so one could count on hearty appetites. They also took along half a 
dozen bottles of wine: not much for fifty people (including more than 
fifteen healthy young men). 

And indeed, the outing turned out to be even better than expected. 
Nothing was lacking. They danced in a group of sixteen couples, then 
in twelve, then eighteen, and one quadrille even in twenty. They 
played a game of tag!°3—almost twenty-two couples—and then de- 
vised three swings between trees. In the intervals they ate and drank 
tea. For half an hour (no, less, much less) almost half the group listened 
to an argument between Dmitry Sergeich and two students who were 
closest to him of all his younger friends.1°* They attacked each other 
for inconsequentiality, moderatism, and bourgeois tendencies.!°% 
These were general charges. But then each and every one in particular 
was accused of a special fault: for one it was romanticism, for Dmitry 
Sergeich, schematism, for another, rigorism. Needless to say, it was 
difficult for the uninitiated to tolerate these investigations for more 
than a few minutes. Even one of the debaters, the romantic, couldn't 
stand more than an hour and a half;!°6 he ran off to join the dancers, 
but not without his moment of glory. He was indignant at some mod- 
eratist (it could have been me, except I wasn’t there),!°7 and knowing 
that the object of his wrath was quite advanced in years, he exclaimed, 
“Why are you talking about him? I'll quote some words uttered several 
days ago by a very respectable person, a very clever woman: ‘A person 
can maintain an honest way of thinking only up to the age of twenty- 

103. Gorelki (“catch”) is a popular Russian game in which one player tries to catch the 
others, who in turn run away in pairs. 

104. Part of the group clearly had formed a radical circle, and were using the outing as 
a pretext to get together to discuss revolutionary ideas and strategy. One of the students, 
the “rigorist,” is Rakhmetov (see n. 96 above). 

105. “Inconsequentiality” means inconsistency, while “moderatism” signifies modera- 
tion. Radicals used these epithets to accuse their comrades or opponents of insufficient 
dedication and effectiveness in their pursuit of the revolutionary cause. 

106. Perhaps a reference to Chernyshevsky's coeditor of the journal Sovremennik, the 
poet and publisher Nikolai Nekrasov (1821-1878), whose popularity among younger 
radical intellectuals rested as much on his willingness to publish their work as on his 
own verse criticizing the tsarist social and political order. 


107. Chernyshevsky is referring to his own inability to take part in such events because 
of his imprisonment.

yo 


five.” “I know that lady,” said an officer who, unfortunately for the 
romantic, had just come up to the debaters. “It was Madame N. and I 
was there when she said it. She really is an excellent woman, but she 
was caught because only half an hour before that she’d boasted that 
she herself was twenty-six years old. Remember how she laughed 
along with everyone else?” Then all four of them burst out laughing, 
and the romantic ran off laughing, too. 

But the officer replaced him in the debate; the enjoyment was even 
greater than before and lasted right up to teatime. The officer attacked 
the rigorist and the schematist more fiercely than the romantic had, 
while he in turn was accused of Auguste Comteanism.!°8 After tea the 
officer declared that so long as he still had some years of honest 
thought left, he wasn’t averse to joining other people of the same age. 
Dmitry Sergeich, and then even the unwilling rigorist, followed his 
example. They refused to join in the dancing but did agree to play a 
game of tag. When the men decided to run races, jump over a ditch, 
and wrestle, the three thinkers showed themselves to be very enthusi- 
astic contenders in these masculine pursuits. The officer took first 
place jumping over the ditch; Dmitry Sergeich, a very strong man, got 
upset when the officer defeated him in a wrestling match. He’d hoped 
to come in second in this event, behind the rigorist, who'd effortlessly 
lifted both the officer and Dmitry Sergeich into the air and then 
pinned them both to the ground. This aroused no further ambition in 
either Dmitry Sergeich or the officer. The rigorist was an acknowl- 
edged athlete. However, Dmitry Sergeich in no way wished to endure 
the affront of being defeated by the officer. He wrestled with him five 
times; five times, even though with some difficulty, the officer pinned 
him. After the sixth bout, Dmitry Sergeich acknowledged that he was 
undoubtedly the weaker of the two: both were utterly exhausted. Then 
the three thinkers lay down on the grass and continued their argu- 
ment. Now it was Dmitry Sergeich who turned out to be the Auguste 
Comtean and the officer a schematist, while the rigorist remained a 
rigorist as before. 

Thev left for home at eleven o'clock. The older women and children 
fell asleep in the boats. It was a good thing they'd brought along plenty 
of warm clothing. Meanwhile the others talked incessantly; in all six 
dinghies there was no end to the merriment and laughter. 


108. The French philosopher and sociologist August Comte (1798-1857) founded the 
positivist school of philosophy and originated the term “sociology” to signify the scien- 
tific, empirical study of society. He believed that such study would lead to reforms that 
could ensure social harmony and bring about general well-being. Although influenced 
by his ideas, Chernyshevsky branded Comte “inconsequential” because of the idealism 
expressed in his later works. 


What Is to Be Done? 205 
vii. 


Two days later during morning tea Vera Pavlovna remarked to her 
husband that she didn't like the pallor of his face. He replied that he'd 
slept badly and that he'd not been feeling too well since last evening, 
but that it was nothing. Probably he'd caught a mild cold on their 
outing, no doubt from lying on the grass so long after the races and the 
wrestling match. He scolded himself for being so careless and con- 
vinced Vera Pavlovna that there was no cause for concern. He went 
about his usual business. At evening tea he said that he was feeling 
much better. 

The next morning, however, he announced that he ought to stay 
home for a few days. Vera Pavlovna, who'd been very concerned the 
day before, was now extremely alarmed. She demanded that Dmitry 
Sergeich send for a doctor. “But I’m also a doctor, and I can treat 
myself if need be. For the moment that isn't necessary,” he replied. But 
Vera Pavlovna was insistent. So he wrote a note to Kirsanov saying that 
his illness was minor, but that he was asking him to come simply in 
order to please his wife. 

As a result Kirsanov was in no hurry. He stayed at the hospital until 
dinner and it was already six o'clock in the evening when he arrived at 
the Lopukhovs'’. 

“Well, Alexander, it’s a good thing I called you,” said Lopukhov. “It’s 
not dangerous, and probably won't be, but I have pneumonia. Of 
course, I could have cured myself without you, but do call in on me. It 
can't be helped. It’s needed to ease my conscience, since I'm not a 
bachelor like you.” 

For a long time they probed; Kirsanov sounded Lopukhov’s chest 
and they both agreed that Lopukhov's diagnosis was correct. It wasn't 
dangerous and probably wouldn't be, but he did have a bad case of 
pneumonia. He would have to remain in bed for a week and a half or 
so. Lopukhov had let the illness go a bit too far; still it wasn’t very 
serious. 

Kirsanov had to spend a long time with Vera Pavlovna to soothe her 
fears. At last she was completely convinced that they weren't deceiving 
her and that in all probability the illness was not only not dangerous 
but not even too serious. Still, only “in all probability”! How many 
things can happen against all probability? 

Kirsanov began to visit the patient twice a day. They both saw that 
there weren't any complications and that the illness wasn’t danger- 
ous. On the fourth day Kirsanov said to Vera Pavlovna, “Dmitry is doing 
fine. For the next three or four days it may be rough going, but no 
worse than yesterday. Then he'll start to mend. But I need to have a 


206 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


serious talk with you, Vera Pavlovna. You’re behaving badly! Why aren't 
you getting any sleep at night? He doesn’t need a nurse to sit up with 
him and he doesn't need a doctor. You'll harm your own health and all 
for nothing. Why, even now your nerves are somewhat strained.” 

He tried to reason with her for a long time, but to no avail. “Never,” 
she said, “impossible.” “I'd be glad to, but I couldn’t possibly,” that is, 
get some sleep at night and leave her husband unattended. At last she 
replied, “Everything you say to me now, he has said to me before, 
many times, as you well know. Of course I would have obeyed him 
sooner than you. In other words, I cannot.” 

There was no way to counter such an argument. Kirsanov shook his 
head and left. 

He came back to see the patient at ten o'clock that evening and sat at 
his side for about a half hour along with Vera Pavlovna. Then he said to 
her, “Vera Pavlovna, now you must go and get some rest. We both 
beseech you. I'll spend the night here.” 

Vera Pavlovna was embarrassed. She herself was half convinced 
(even more than half) that there really was no need to sit up all night 
next to the patient, and that she was forcing a busy man like Kirsanov 
to waste his time. What about it? Perhaps it wasn't really necessary? 
Perhaps, but who knows? No, she couldn't possibly leave her dearest 
alone! Who knows what might happen? He might want a drink or a 
cup of tea. He’s so considerate! He wouldn't wake me up. That means 
she'd have to attend him. There was no need for Kirsanov to stay; she 
wouldn't allow it. She said that she wouldn't leave because she wasn't 
all that tired, and that she got lots of rest during the day. 

“In that case, forgive me, but I must ask you to leave, I simply insist 
on it.” 

Kirsanov took her by the hand and almost had to lead her to her 
own room by force. 

“T really feel guilty before you, Alexander,” uttered the patient. “What 
a ridiculous role you have to play, sitting up at night with a sick man 
whose illness doesn’t require it. But I'm very grateful to you. I couldn't 
persuade her to find a nurse, since she was afraid to leave me alone. 
There was no one she would trust.” 

“If I had realized that she can’t possibly be at peace entrusting you 
to someone else, then, needless to say, I wouldn't have sacrificed my 
own comfort. But I hope that now she'll get some rest. After all, I’m 
both a doctor and your friend.” 

In fact, as soon as she reached her bed, Vera Pavlovna collapsed 
upon it and fell fast asleep. The three sleepless nights she’d spent 
were not significant in and of themselves, nor was her anxiety. But the 
anxiety on top of three sleepless nights, without any rest during the 
day, was really very dangerous. Another two or three days without 


What Is to Be Done? 207 


sleep and her condition would have been far worse than her hus- 
band's. 

Kirsanov spent another three nights with the patient. This didn’t tire 
him at all, naturally, because he slept very soundly, only taking the 
precaution of locking the door so that Vera Pavlovna couldn't observe 
his negligence. She suspected that he was fast asleep at his post, but 
she was calm nevertheless. He was a doctor, after all, so there was 
nothing to fear. He knows when he can sleep and when he can't. She 
was ashamed that she'd been unable to calm herself before, that she'd 
troubled Kirsanov. But now he paid no attention whatever to her 
assurances that she could get some rest even if he weren't there. “You 
are to blame, Vera Pavlovna. Therefore you must be punished. I no 
longer trust you.” 

But four days later it was obvious to her that the patient was almost 
well; the evidence was too clear even to her skeptical mind. That 
evening the three of them sat together playing cards. Lopukhov was no 
longer lying down, but almost sitting up, and his voice was strong. 
Kirsanov could now curtail his sleepy night watches and told them so. 

“Alexander Matveich,” said Vera Pavlovna, “why have you been ne- 
glecting me entirely? I’m talking about myself now. You're still good 
friends with Dmitry, he goes to see you rather frequently. But up until 
his illness you hadn't been to see us for almost half a year. And it’s 
been that way for quite a while. Remember what good friends you and 
I were in the beginning?” 

“People change, Vera Pavlovna. Then again, I’m working very hard, if 
I say so myself. I hardly go visiting. There's no time, and besides, I’m 
lazy. I get so tired from spending my days in the hospital and at the 
Academy that I can’t bear to change into any other clothes from my 
uniform except my dressing gown.!° Friendship is a good thing, but— 
don’t be offended—lying on a sofa in one’s dressing gown smoking a 
cigar is even better.” 

The truth was that Kirsanov had hardly visited the Lopukhovs at all 
for over two years. The reader has not found his name among the list 
of usual guests; among infrequent visitors he had long been the most 
infrequent of all.

The perspicacious reader (I'm addressing only the males in the 
group, since the females are too clever to bore us with their shrewd 
guesses; therefore, once and for all, I declare that I’m not addressing

them. There are also among my male readers a few who aren't stupid; 
I'm not addressing them either. But the majority, including almost all 
men of letters and those purporting to be men of letters, are per- 
spicacious people with whom I always enjoy chatting.) And so it is this 
perspicpacious reader who says, “I understand where all this is lead- 
ing. A new romance is beginning in Vera Pavlovna’s life. Kirsanov will 
play a role in it. I understand even more. Kirsanov has been in love 
with Vera Pavlovna for some time now and that’s why he stopped 
visiting the Lopukhovs.” Oh, how perceptive you are, my perspicacious 
reader! As soon as I tell you something, you immediately reply, “I knew 
that,” and you rejoice in your perspicacity. I bow before you in admira- 
tion, O perspicacious reader! 

And so a new person is appearing in Vera Pavlovna’'s life. | would 
have to describe him if I hadn't done so already. When I spoke of 
Lopukhov, it was difficult to distinguish him from his closest friend, 
and I was unable to say anything about him which could not also be 
said about Kirsanov. All that the perspicacious reader can really dis- 
cover from the following list of Kirsanov's characteristics will be a 
repetition of the description of Lopukhov. Lopukhov was the son of a 
petit bourgeois who was reasonably well off for his class, that is, they 
had meat in their cabbage soup fairly often. Kirsanov was the son of a 
clerk in a district court, that is, they rarely had meat in their cabbage 
soup, which also means that they sometimes did. From his early 
youth, almost since childhood, Lopukhov had earned his own living. 
From the age of twelve Kirsanov had helped his father by copying 
documents; by the time he was in his fourth year at school he was also 
giving lessons. Both men made their own way in life through their own 
efforts, with neither connections nor acquaintances. 

What sort of man was Lopukhov? One didn’t really learn French in 
the gymnasium, and in German class one learned only to decline der, 
die, das with a few mistakes. But upon entering the Academy, Lopu- 
khov soon realized that one can't go far in science knowing only Rus- 
sian. He took a French dictionary and whatever books he could lay his 
hands on—Télémaque,'!° some novels by Madame de Genlis,!!! and a 


110. LesAventures de Télémaque (1699; first published in translation in Russia in 1747); 
written by the influential French writer, mystical Catholic theologian, and pedagogue 
Archbishop Francois de Salignac de la Mothe Fénelon (1651-1715) for the edification of 
Louis, dauphin de France, the heir to the French throne. The book extolled the virtues of 
limited monarchy and agrarian life. Fenelon is best known for his innovative, though still 
conservative and moralistic, ideas on the education of women. 

111. The French writer Stéphanie-Félicité du Crest de Saint-Aubin, comtesse de Genlis 
(1746-1830), a disciple of the French Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rous- 
seau, was a tutor to Louis Philippe (see n. 41 above) and the author of rationalist chil- 
dren’s stories and sentimental novels that were very popular in earlv-nineteenth-cen- 
tury Russia. 


What Is to Be Done? 209 


few issues of our very clever journal Revue étrangére!!2—not very 
tempting works, but still he took them. He was, naturally, an avid 
reader. He said to himself, “I won’t open another Russian book until I 
can read French fluently.” And he did just that. He proceeded with 
German in a different manner. He rented a corner in an apartment 
where a large number of German workmen lived. His corner was 
squalid, the Germans were boring, and it was a long walk to the Acade- 
my, but he endured it nevertheless, for as long as he needed to. 

It was different with Kirsanov. He learned German by reading vari- 
ous books with the help of a dictionary as Lopukhov had French, but 
he learned French in a different way, concentrating on one text with- 
out a dictionary: the Gospels—a very familiar work. He acquired the 
New Testament in the Geneva translation and read it through eight 
times.113 By the ninth he understood everything. He was all set. 

What sort of man was Lopukhov? Here’s what sort. One day he was 
out walking along Kamennoostrovsky [Stone Island] Prospekt in his 
well-worn uniform (returning home from a lesson three versts past the 
Lycée! forwhich he had received fifty kopecks). From the other direc- 
tion heading toward him was a portly gentleman, out on a constitu- 
tional. The portly gent headed straight for him, not about to give way. 
Now at that time Lopukhov had a rule never to yield to anyone except 
a woman. They bumped shoulders. The gentleman, turning slightly 
toward Lopukhov, said, “What sort of swine are you, you pig!” He was 
about to continue this edifying speech when Lopukhov turned to face 
him, seized the gentleman in a bear hug, and deposited him in the 
gutter, very carefully. He stood over him and said, “Don’t move or I'll 
drag you out there where the mud is deeper.” Two peasants came by, 
looked, and applauded. A civil servant went past, looked, and didn’t 
applaud, but smiled sweetly. Some carriages drove by but no one 
looked out—they couldn't have seen that someone was lying in the 
gutter. Lopukhov stood there for some time; then he took the gentle- 
man by the hand (rather than in a bear hug), lifted him up, led him 
back to the street, and said, “Oh, my dear sir, did you stumble? I trust 
you haven’t hurt yourself. Allow me to brush you off.” A peasant came 
by and began to help brush him off; two petit bourgeois went past and 


112. The Revue étrangeére de la littérature, des sciences et des arts (St. Petersburg, 
1832-1863), a journal that contained primarily works by foreign, especially French, writ- 
ers and descriptions of life abroad.

(1506-1538) in 1535, the Geneva Bible was reworked by Calvin between 1545 and 1551

they helped as well. They finished brushing him off and everyone went 
his own way.!15 

Kirsanov didn't have that kind of experience, but had a different one. 
A certain lady who had several people doing her bidding decided that 
she should have a catalogue made of the library left her by her hus- 
band, who'd died some twenty years before, and who'd been a devot- 
ed follower of Voltaire.1!6 Why it was that twenty years later a cata- 
logue was needed isn’t at all clear. Kirsanov was chosen to do the job, 
for which he would receive the sum of eighty rubles. He worked on it 
about a month and a half. Suddenly the woman decided that the 
catologue wasn’t really needed at all. She came into the library and 
said, “Don't trouble yourself, I've changed my mind. Here’s what I owe 
you for your labor.” She handed Kirsanov ten rubles. “Madame,” he 
said, using the lady's full title, “I've done more than half the work. Out 
of seventeen bookcases I’ve already catalogued ten.” “Do you mean to 
say that I’ve underpaid you? Nicolas, come in here and have a little talk 
with this gentleman.” Nicolas came crashing in. “How dare you insult 
maman?” “Why, you young whippersnapper,” said Kirsanov (an un- 
justified expression, as Nicolas was at least five years older than Kir- 
sanov). “You should listen before you interfere.” Nicolas screamed for 
the servants. “Oh, the servants, eh? I'll show you servants!” In a twin- 
kling of an eye the lady shrieked and fainted; Nicolas realized that he 
could no longer move his arms, both of which were pinned to his sides 
as if by an iron band (which was really Kirsanov’s right arm) and that 
Kirsanov'’s left hand, which had yanked his head back by the forelock, 
was now grabbing him around the throat. Kirsanov said, “See how 
easily I could strangle you,” and he began to squeeze the throat. Nic- 
olas realized how easily indeed he could be strangled; Kirsanov re- 
leased his grip on Nicolas’s throat so that he could breathe but didn’t 
take his hand completely away. Turning to the Goliaths who'd ap- 
peared at the door, Kirsanov said, “Stop right there or I'll choke him. 
Step aside or I'll strangle him.” Nicolas understood all this in a twin- 
kling of an eye and indicated by a gesture that yes indeed, the gentle- 
man was telling the whole truth. “Now, brother, you'll escort me to the 
stairs,” said Kirsanov, turning again to Nicolas and maintaining his 
hold. He went into the hallway and down the stairs, accompanied 
from afar by tender looks from the Goliaths. On the bottom step he 
released his grip on Nicolas’s throat, pushed him out the way, and 


115. Lopukhov's behavior is meant to demonstrate both his rejection of the estab- 
lished social hierarchy and his basic humanitarianism. Having asserted his equality by 
defying his nominal social superior, he humanely helps the gentleman out of the gutter 
into which he has pushed him. 

116. On Voltaire, see n. 77 above. 


What Is to Be Done? 211 


went off to find a shop where he could buy himself a cap to replace the 
one he'd left as Nicolas’s booty. 

Well, what difference do you see between these two men? All of their 
most outstanding traits belong not to the two individuals but to a 
type—one so different from those to which you are accustomed, O 
perspicacious reader, that any individual differences are masked by 
general similarities. When seen among others these people are like a 
few Europeans among the Chinese; the Chinese can’t distinguish be- 
tween them, seeing only one thing—that they're all “redheaded bar- 
barians, ignorant of ceremony.”!!7 In Chinese eyes the French are just 
as “redheaded” as the English. And the Chinese are correct: in their 
relations with them, all Europeans behave as one, not as individuals, 
but as representatives of a type, and nothing more. None of them eats 
cockroaches or woodlice, none cuts people up into small pieces; they 
all drink vodka and wine made from grapes instead of rice; even the 
one thing that the Chinese recognize as their own native custom, tea 
drinking, is done differently by Europeans, who take their tea with 
sugar rather than straight. 

In just the same way people of the type to which Lopukhov and 
Kirsanov belong seem to be alike to people of a different sort. Each of 
them is a man of courage, unwavering and unyielding, capable of 
grappling with any task; upon doing so, he keeps a firm grasp on that 
task so that it doesn’t slip away. This is one side of their character. On 
the other hand, each of them is a man of such irreproachable honesty 
that it never even occurs to us to ask, “Can this man be relied upon 
unconditionally?” This is as clear as the fact that each man is alive and 
breathing. As long as his chest continues to rise and fall with each 
breath, it’s both passionate and true: you can lean your head upon it 
confidently and rest it there. These general characteristics are so 
prominent that any individual differences behind them are blurred. 

This type arose among us not that long ago. Before then there were 
only isolated individuals who foreshadowed it. They were exceptions 
and as such they felt isolated and impotent. As a result they did 
nothing; they experienced despair or exaltation, romanticized or fan- 
tasized; that is, they couldn't partake of the main characteristics of this 
type—cold-blooded practicality, measured and calculated activity, 
and active common sense. Though they were people of the same 
nature, they had not yet developed into this type. This type arose quite 
recently. It didn’t exist yet during my time, though I'm not very old, 
perhaps not old at all. I myself couldn't develop in that way, since I 
grew up in a different era. Because I don't belong to this type, I can 


117. The source of this curious quotation is unknown. 


212 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


express my unabashed admiration for it. Unfortunately, I’m not prais- 
ing myself when I say that these people are truly splendid. 

This type appeared quite recently but now it's propagating quickly. 
It was engendered by its epoch; it’s an emblem of it, and (shall I say it?) 
it will vanish together with it all too quickly. Its fate was to appear not 
that long ago and to vanish very soon. These people couldn't even be 
found just six years ago; three years ago they were despised; and 
now—but it doesn't really matter what people think of them now. Ina 
few years, a very few, people will call out to them, “Save us!” What this 
type says will be done by all. A few years later, perhaps not even years, 
but a few months later, they'll be cursed, driven from the stage, hissed 
at, and insulted. So what? Hiss and hurl insults, drive them away and 
curse them; you got your use out of them, and that’s enough for them. 
And amidst the noise of hissing and the thunder of curses they'll leave 
the stage, proud and humble, stern and kind, just as they always were. 
But won't even one of them be left on stage? No. How will we fare 
without them? Badly. But life will still be better after them than before. 
Years will pass and people will say, “Life is better after them, but it’s 
still not good.” And when they say this, it will mean that the time has 
come for this type to reappear. It will be reborn in even greater num- 
bers and in better forms, because there will be more good in the world 
then, and all that’s already good will be better. History will repeat itself 
in a new form. And so it will continue until such time as people say, 
“Well, now life is good.” Then this special type will cease to exist 
because all people will be of this type. It will be difficult to understand 
that there ever was a time when this type was regarded as special, and 
not as the general nature of all people.

But just as Europeans among the Chinese seem to have one and the 
same face and one way of acting only in Chinese eyes, in fact there are 
incomparably more variations among Europeans than among the 
Chinese. So, too, in this new, apparently single type, the diversity of 
personalities develops into numerous varieties that differ from one 
another more than all the individuals of all the other types differ 
among themselves. There are all kinds: sybarites and ascetics, stern 
people and tender, and others, and others besides. . . . But just as the 
most savage European is very gentle, the most cowardly very brave, 
and the most voluptuous very moral in the eyes of the Chinese, so it is 
with them. The most ascetic consider that men need more comforts 
than people not of their type can imagine; the most sensual are stricter 


What Is to Be Done? 213 


in their moral precepts than moralizers of another type. But they have 
their very own ideas about morality and comfort, sensuality and virtue. 
They view these things in their own special way, all in the same way. 
They view it not only in the same way, but in such a way that some- 
how morality, comfort, virtue, and sensuality all seem to be one and 
the same thing. But again, all this is only when viewed from the point 
of view of the Chinese; among themselves there’s a great variety of 
conceptions according to their different natures. But how can we 
grasp these differences in nature and concepts among them? 

Europeans reveal their variety in conversations among themselves, 
but only among themselves, not in the presence of the Chinese. Thus 
the very great variety among people of this type becomes apparent 
when they're conducting their own business, but only then and not 
with outsiders. We have met two people of this type, Vera Pavlovna and 
Lopukhov, and we've seen how relations were arranged between 
them. Now a third person appears. Let’s see what differences emerge 
when were given an opportunity to compare one with the other two. 
Vera Pavlovna sees before her both Lopukhov and Kirsanov. Previously 
she had no choice; now she does.

But first we must say a few words about Kirsanov’s external appear- 
ance. He has regular and handsome features, just like Lopukhov. Some 
people regard Kirsanov as the better looking of the two, others Lopu- 
khov. Lopukhov has a darker complexion, chestnut-brown hair, spark- 
ling brown eyes that appear almost black, an aquiline nose, thick lips, 
and a somewhat oval face. Kirsanov has dark blond hair, dark blue 
eyes, a straight Grecian nose, a small mouth, and an oblong face, 
remarkably pale. Both are fairly tall men and both slender; Lopukhov is 
a bit broader in frame, Kirsanov a bit taller. 

Kirsanov’s circumstances are rather good. He already occupies a 
chair. The great majority of the faculty had been against him; not only 
didn't they want to give him a chair, they didn’t even want to grant his 
degree. But that proved to be impossible. Two or three young men, 
and one of his former professors who wasn't so young, all of them his 
friends, had declared to the rest of the faculty some time before that 
there was a certain man named Virchow who lived in Berlin,118 and 


118. The German pathologist Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) contributed significantly to 
several branches of medical research, especially cellular pathology, and pioneered sani- 
tary reform in medical practice. 


214 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


one named Claude Bernard who lived in Paris,!!* and a few more men 
whose names I can't remember and who lived in different cities, and 
that these Virchows, Claude Bernards, and others were the luminaries 
of medical science. All of this seemed to us extremely unlikely, since 
we knew very well that the luminaries of medical science were Boer- 
haave!2° and Hofeland.12! Harvey was also a great scientist, who dis- 
covered the circulation of the blood;!?? and Jenner, who taught us how 
to vaccinate against smallpox.!23 Those names we knew, but we didn't 
recognize these Virchows and Claude Bernards. What sort of lumin- 
aries were they? On the other hand, how the devil could you tell for 
sure? Well, it was this very same Claude Bernard who'd spoken re- 
spectfully about Kirsanov’s work when the young student was still 
completing his studies. Therefore, it proved to be impossible: they 
granted Kirsanov’s degree and a year and a half later they awarded 
him a chair. The students said that with his arrival the contingent of 
good professors had increased significantly. He didn’t take on private 
patients and declared that he'd given up practicing medicine. But he 
spent a great deal of time in the hospital; some days he had dinner 
there and occasionally even spent the night. What was he doing there? 
He said he was working on behalf of science, and not for the patients: 
“I’m not treating anyone. I'm merely making observations and doing 
experiments.” The students confirmed this, adding that at the present 
time only quacks treated patients, since it wasn’t possible to cure 
them yet. The hospital attendants thought differently. They said 
among themselves, “Well, if Kirsanov’s taking this patient into his 
ward, it must be a difficult case.” Afterward they would remark to the 
patient, “Take heart. It’s a rare disease that can stand up to this doctor. 
He’s a real master and will be like a father to you.” 


119. The French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813-1878) is considered the founder of 
experimental medicine both for his path-breaking research, especially on the digestive 
process, and for his theories on scientific methodology, expressed most fully in his 
famous treatise Introduction a la medicine expérimentale (1865). 

120. The Dutch physician and humanist Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738) revived the 
Hippocratic method of bedside instruction for training physicians and instituted the 
practice of conferences between physicians and pathologists to diagnose diseases after 
his studies demonstrated the link between symptoms and lesions. 

121. The German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland (1762-1836) taught at Jena 
and Berlin universities, helped to pioneer the use of vaccination, and treated such 
distinguished people as Goethe, Herder, and the Prussian royal couple. 

122. Widely considered to be the founder of modern medicine, the English physician 
William Harvey (1578-1657) contributed significantly to comparative anatomy and em- 
bryology. He was also first to demonstrate the function of the heart and the complete 
circulation of the blood. 

123. The English physician Edward Jenner (1747-1823) helped to eradicate smallpox 
and laid the foundation for modern immunology by proving that exposure to cowpox 
provided immunity to smallpox. The comparison of Kirsanov with medical scientists of 
such standing as Jenner is meant to indicate not only Kirsanov's exceptional personal 
qualities and the social utility of his work but also the attainment by Russian scientists of 
equality with their European counterparts. 


What Is to Be Done? 215 
xi. 


During the first few months of Vera Pavlovna's married life Kirsanov 
visited the Lopukhovs very often, almost every other day, or, to be 
more accurate, almost every day. Soon, right from the beginning, he 
became extraordinarily friendly with Vera Pavlovna, just as friendly as 
he was with Lopukhov. This situation continued for about half a year. 
One day the three of them were sitting together: he, the husband, and 
she. The conversation was proceeding as usual, without any 
ceremony. Kirsanov was chatting more than the other two, when he 
suddenly fell silent. 

“What's the matter, Alexander?” 

“Why have you gone so quiet, Alexander Matveich?” 

“Oh, it’s nothing much—just feeling depressed.” 

“That rarely happens to you, Alexander Matveich,” said Vera Pavlov- 
na. 

“And never without some cause,” said Kirsanov in a somewhat 
strained tone. 

A little while later, somewhat earlier than usual, he got up and left, 
taking his leave simply as always. 

Two days later Lopukhov told Vera Pavlovna that he’d dropped in on 
Kirsanov and that it seemed to him that he was received in a rather 
strange way. Kirsanov was trying hard to behave in a friendly fashion 
toward him, which was completely unnecessary in their relationship. 
Looking him straight in the eye, Lopukhov had said, “Alexander, you 
seem to be angry at someone. Is it me?” 

“No.” 

“Verochka?” 

“No.” 

“Well, then, what is it?” 

“Nothing at all. Why do you think so?” 

“Youre not being very nice to me today. You seem constrained, 
trying hard to be friendly, and annoyed at something.” 

Kirsanov kept reassuring him copiously that there was nothing 
wrong, and by so doing demonstrated conclusively that he was indeed 
annoyed. Then he must have become ashamed; he was his old self 
again—simple and good. Lopukhov, availing himself of the man’s rea- 
sonableness, asked him again, “Well, Alexander, now tell me, what 
were you sulking about?” 

“I never did anything of the kind,” he replied, and once again he 
became unctuous and disagreeable. 

What a mystery! Lopukhov could recall nothing that might have 
offended him; that didn’t even seem possible given their mutual re- 
spect and warm friendship. Vera Pavlovna also tried hard to recall if 
she'd offended him in any way; she too could think of nothing. She 


216 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


knew that as far as she was concerned, it was impossible for the very 
same reason as in her husband's case. 

Two more days passed. It was very unusual for four days to go by 
without Kirsanov coming to visit the Lopukhovs. Vera Pavlovna began 
to wonder whether he might be ill. Lopukhov dropped by to see. II? 
Nonsense! But he was still sulking. Lopukhov questioned him per- 
sistently. After repeated denials, he began to utter some nonsense 
about his feelings for Lopukhov and Vera Pavlovna, how he loved and 
respected them. From everything he said, it seemed that they were 
neglecting him, but how exactly—and this was the worst part of all— 
there wasn't the slightest indication in his bombastic speech. It was 
clear that the gentleman had taken offense. All this was so strange to 
behold in a man such as Lopukhov considered Kirsanov to be that the 
guest said to his host, “Listen, you and | are friends. You should be 
ashamed of yourself.” Kirsanov replied with affected forbearance that 
perhaps it was indeed petty on his part, but what could he do if he’d 
been offended by so many things? “Well, by what?” Kirsanov began to 
list a multitude of instances that had offended him of late, all of the 
following kind: “You said that the lighter a man’s hair is, the drabber 
he is in general. Vera Pavlovna said that the price of tea had risen. The 
former was a caustic remark about the color of my hair; the latter, a 
hint that I’m eating you out of house and home.” Lopukhov stood 
there stupefied. The man had gone mad or was obsessed by pride; 
more accurately, he’d simply become a fool, a petty fool. 

Lopukhov returned home sadly. He was grieved to see that side of a 
man whom he'd loved so much. In reply to Vera Pavlovna’s inquiries as 
to what he'd learned, he answered sadly that it was best not to talk 
about it; Kirsanov had uttered unpleasant nonsense and was probably 
indisposed. 

Two or three days later Kirsanov must have come to his senses and 
realized the extreme vulgarity of his wild behavior. He came to visit the 
Lopukhovs and acted normal. Then he began to describe how vulgar 
he'd been. From Vera Pavlovna’s reaction he realized that she hadn't 
heard any of his inanities repeated by her husband and he sincerely 
thanked Lopukhov for his discretion. So, to punish himself, he began 
to tell her everything he'd said. Then he became deeply moved; he 
apologized and declared that he'd been indisposed and things turned 
out badly once again. Vera Pavlovna tried to say that he should forget 
it, that it was all a mere trifle. He latched on to the word “trifle” and 
began to utter the same kind of trite nonsense he had spoken during 
the earlier conversation with Lopukhov. With great delicacy and sub- 
tlety he developed the theme that of course it was only a mere “trifle,” 
since he well understood his insignificance in the eyes of the Lopu- 
khovs, and that he deserved no better, etc., etc. All of this was said with 
the darkest, subtlest innuendos accompanied by the most cordial ex- 


What Is to Be Done? 217 


pressions of respect and sincerity. Hearing it all, Vera Pavlovna was as 
stupefied as her husband had been. When Kirsanov left, they recalled 
that he'd been acting strange for several days before his first vulgar 
outburst. They hadn’t noticed it or understood it then; now all of his 
previous remarks had become clear—they were in the same vein, but 
only pale indications of what was to come. 

After this Kirsanov began to visit the Lopukhovs fairly frequently, but 
a continuation of their previous simple relations was no longer possi- 
ble. For those few days such a long ass's ear had stuck out from behind 
a respectable man’s mask that the Lopukhovs would have lost too 
much of the respect they’d had for their former friend even if that ear 
were to be hidden away again forever. But that ear continued to show 
itself every now and then, not for so long a time, and it was quickly 
concealed, still it was there—pitiful, rotten, petty. 

Soon the Lopukhovs grew. cold toward Kirsanov; once having been 
provided with a valid excuse not to enjoy his visits there, he stopped 
them entirely. 

But he continued to meet the Lopukhovs at the homes of certain 
mutual friends. In a little while Lopukhov's aversion to him began to 
lessen. Kirsanov behaved quite decently, as a gentleman. Lopukhov 
began to drop in on him. In a year or so Kirsanov even renewed his 
own visits to the Lopukhovs and became his former excellent self— 
simple and honest. But his visits were infrequent. Clearly he found it 
awkward to recall the details of those absurd scenes he'd enacted. 
Lopukhov had almost forgotten all about it. So had Vera Pavlovna. But 
once relations are broken off, they can’t really be reestablished. To all 
appearances he and Lopukhov were friends again, and in fact Lopu- 
khov began to respect him as before and visit him frequently. Vera 
Pavlovna also restored to him part of her previous affection, but she 
saw him very rarely. 


xii. 


And now Lopukhov’s illness, or more precisely, Vera Pavlovna’s ex- 
traordinary attachment to her husband, forced Kirsanov to spend 
more than a week in intimate, daily contact with the Lopukhovs. He 
realized that he was walking a perilous path when he decided to sit up 
at night with the patient to relieve Vera Pavlovna of her vigil. He was so 
glad and proud of the fact that about three years ago, having observed 
the first signs of passion in himself, he’d so successfully managed to 
do all that was necessary to arrest its development. He felt so good as a 
result. For two or three weeks he'd been drawn to the Lopukhovs’, but 
at the same time he experienced more pleasure from the awareness of 
his resolve in the struggle than pain from the deprivation. Within a 


218 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


month the pain had completely disappeared and there remained only 
satisfaction with his own integrity. His soul was so calm, so sweet. 

But now the danger was greater than ever before. During the three 
intervening years Vera Pavlovna had, of course, undergone great moral 
development. Then she was scarcely more than a child, but not any 
more. The feeling she inspired no longer resembled the amusing at- 
tachment to a little girl whom one both loves and laughs at simultane- 
ously. Vera’s development was not only moral. If a woman's beauty is 
genuine, then here in the North such a woman continues to improve 
with each passing year. Yes, three years of life at such a period do a 
great deal to develop much that is good in the soul, in the eyes, in 
facial features, and in the whole person, provided that person is good 
and life is, too. 

The danger was great, but only for Kirsanov. What danger was there 
for Vera Pavlovna? She loved her husband. Kirsanov was not so empty- 
headed and stupid as to consider himself a dangerous rival to Lopu- 
khov. It was not out of false modesty that he thought so. All respect- 
able people who knew both him and Lopukhov considered them 
equals. On Lopukhov’s side there was the immeasurable advantage 
that he'd already earned Vera's love. Yes, he'd done so, and had also 
won her heart. Her choice had been made; she was very satisfied and 
happy with it. The idea of looking for something better couldn't even 
occur to her. Wasn't she happy? Why, it was foolish even to think 
about such a thing! To worry about her or Lopukhov would have been 
no more than absurd self-conceit on Kirsanov’s part. 

And for this nonsense, for a month or two, maximum, of heartache, 
he was going to allow a woman to strain her nerves and risk serious 
illness by sitting up nights on end in a sickroom; and merely to avoid 
any unimportant and brief disruption in the serenity of his own life 
was he going to permit serious harm to come to another, no less 
worthy person? Why, that would be dishonest! And such a dishonest 
act is fundamentally much more unpleasant than any slight struggle 
within himself which he would have to endure, and concerning the 
outcome of which (in proud satisfaction at his own resolve) he had no 
doubt. 

This is the way Kirsanov reasoned when he decided to relieve Vera 
Pavlovna of her unnecessary vigil. 

The need for the vigil passed. To maintain appearances and to avoid 
effecting a break so abrupt that it would attract attention, Kirsanov was 
compelled to visit the Lopukhovs two or three more times, then a week 
later, then in a month, then in six months. At that point his absence 
could be adequately explained by other obligations. 


xiii. 


Everything was going well with Kirsanov, as he’d expected. His at- 


What Is to Be Done? 219 


tachment was renewed, and became even stronger than before, but his 
struggle with it was manageable and entailed no serious torment. Now 
Kirsanov is visiting the Lopukhovs for the second time, one week after 
Dmitry Sergeich’s recovery, and staying until nine o'clock in the eve- 
ning. That's enough: propriety has been maintained. He would come 
again in two weeks. The separation has almost been accomplished. 
Now he need stay only another hour or so. Within this week the 
development of his passion has almost been arrested; in a month it 
will pass completely. He’s very pleased with himself. He takes part in 
the conversation so naturally that he himself rejoices in his success; as 
aresult of his satisfaction, the naturalness of his conduct increases all 
the more. 

Tomorrow Lopukhov had been planning to go outside for the first 
time. Consequently Vera Pavlovna was in a particularly good mood 
and was rejoicing almost as much as—no, certainly even more than— 
the convalescent himself. Their conversation touched on his illness 
and they all laughed about it, facetiously praising Vera Pavlovna’s con- 
jugal self-sacrifice, very nearly ruining her own health by worrying 
about something that wasn’t worth worrying about. 

“Well you may laugh,” she said, “but I know you wouldn't have had 
the strength to behave any differently if you’d been in my position.” 

“Just look at the influence that the concern of others exerts on a 
person,” said Lopukhov. “Why, that person himself is partially subject 
to the delusion that he needs God-knows-what kind of care when he 
sees how worried others are. I could have gone outside three days ago, 
yet I remained inside. This morning I wanted to go out, but I post- 
poned it for another day just to be on the safe side.” 

“Yes,” Kirsanov confirmed, “you could have gone outside some time 
ago.” 

“That’s what I call heroism, and to tell the truth, I'm sick of it. I'd like 
to run outside at once.” 

“My dear, you were behaving so heroically for my sake. If in fact 
you're so eager to put an end to your quarantine, let’s go outside at 
once. I'll soon be going over to the workshop for half an hour. Let's go 
together: it would be very nice if the very first visit you paid after your 
illness was to our shop. The girls will take notice and be very pleased 
by such attention.” 

“All right, let’s go together,” said Lopukhov with noticeable pleasure 
at the thought of breathing in some fresh air that very day. 

“What a tactful hostess I am,” said Vera Pavlovna. “Alexander Mat- 
veich, it never occurred to me that perhaps you might not want to 
come with us.” 

“No, on the contrary, it would be very interesting. I’ve been meaning 
to go there for some time.” 

And indeed, Vera Pavlovna’s idea was a fortuitous one. The girls 
really were pleased that Lopukhov should pay them his first visit after 


220 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


his recovery. Kirsanov really was interested in the workshop. How 
could a man of his way of thinking not be so? If a special reason hadn't 
prevented him, he would have been one of the most enthusiastic 
instructors in it from the very beginning. Half an hour, perhaps even 
an hour, flew by unnoticed. Vera Pavlovna took him through various 
rooms showing him everything. As they were returning from the din- 
ing area to the workrooms, a young woman came up to Vera Pavlovna 
who'd not been there before. She and Kirsanov exchanged glances. 

“Nastenka!” 

“Sasha!"!24 and they embraced. 

“Sashenka,!75 my friend, I'm so glad to see you!” The girl kept kissing 
him, laughing and crying at the same time. When she'd recovered from 
her joy, she said, “No, Vera Pavlovna, I can’t talk about business now. I 
can't bear to part with him. Sashenka, let’s go to my room.” 

Kirsanov was just as glad as she was, although Vera Pavlovna had 
observed considerable sadness in his eyes when he first recognized 
her. There was good reason: the girl was in the final stages of con- 
sumption.}26 

Nastya Kryukova had joined the workshop about a year before, and 
even then she was very ill. If she'd remained in the shop where she'd 
been working previously, she surely would have been dead long since 
from overwork. But in this workshop she'd been given a chance to live 
a little longer. The girls had released her from any real sewing; there 
was plenty of other work to be done which would pose no threat to 
her health. She looked after about half the everyday needs of the 
workshop, helping to supervise various storerooms and to receive or- 
ders. No one could argue that Kryukova was less useful in the work- 
shop than any of the other girls. 

The Lopukhovs left without waiting for the end of the meeting be- 
tween Kirsanov and Kryukova. 


xiv. Kryukova’s Story 


Early the next morning Kryukova went to see Vera Paviovna. “I'd like 
to talk with you about what you saw yesterday, Vera Pavlovna,” she 
said. Then she was at a loss for some time as to how to go on. “I don't 
want you to think ill of him.” 

“What do you mean? You yourself seem to be thinking ill of me, 
Nastasya Borisovna!”

“No, had I been someone else, I'd never have thought this. But you 
know I’m not like the others.” 

“No, Nastasya Borisovna, you have no right to talk about yourself like 
that. We've known you for a year. Many members of our community 
have known you even longer.” 

“So I see that you don’t know anything about me.” 

“No, on the contrary. I know a great deal about you. You worked as a 
maid, most recently for the actress N. When she got married, you left 
to get away from her husband's father. Then you went to work in a 
shop, after which you came to us. I know all this with all the details.” 

“Of course, I was sure that Maksimova and Sheina, who knew all 
about me before, wouldn't tell my whole story. All the same, I thought 
you or the others might have heard about me from someone else. Oh, 
I'm so glad they don't know everything! I'll tell you anyway, so you'll 
know how kind Kirsanov is. I was a very wicked girl, Vera Pavlovna.” 

“You, Nastasya Borisovna?” 

“Yes, Vera Pavlovna, I was. And I was very insolent, shameless, and 
always drunk. That's why I'm so sick now, Vera Pavlovna; in spite of my 
weak chest, I used to drink too much.” 

Vera Pavlovna had encountered similar cases on three or four other 
occasions. Girls whose behavior was irreproachable after they met 
Vera Pavlovna had told her that for some time before they'd been 
leading wicked lives. She was astonished the first time she heard such 
a confession. But after thinking about it for a few days, she asked 
herself, “What about my own life? The soil I grew up in was also bad, 
but it didn’t stick to me; thousands of women who grow up in families 
no better than mine manage to remain pure just the same. What's so 
extraordinary about emerging from that humiliation intact, if good 
fortune has enabled you to be spared?” When she listened to the 
second confession of this sort she was no longer so astonished that 
the girl making it had preserved all the noble qualities of a human 
being: unselfishness, loyalty in friendship, a tender heart—even a fair 
share of innocence. 

“Nastasya Borisovna, I've already had conversations such as the one 
you wish to begin. It’s painful both to the speaker and to the listener. 
I'll respect you no less, probably more than ever, now that I know how 
much you've endured. But I understand everything even without hav- 
ing heard you out. Let’s not talk about it: there’s no reason for you to 
explain yourself to me. I myself spent many years in great misery. I try 
not to think about it now, and I don't like to talk about it. I find it all 
very painful.” 

“No, Vera Pavlovna, I feel differently. I want to tell you how kind he 
is. | want someone to know how obligated I am to him. Who can | tell 
besides you? It will be a relief to me. Of course, there’s nothing to be 


222 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


said about the kind of life I led—it’s the same for all such poor crea- 
tures. I only want to tell you about how I first became acquainted with 
him. I enjoy talking about him so much. Since I’m going to move in 
with him, you should know why I’m leaving the workshop.” 

“If telling the story will give you pleasure, Nastasya Borisovna, I'd be 
glad to hear it. Just let me pick up some work to do.” 

“Yes, but I can’t do any work. The girls have been kind enough to 
find me a job suited to my health. I want to thank each and every one 
of them. Vera Pavlovna, tell them that I asked you to thank them for 
me. 

“IT used to walk along Nevsky Prospekt, Vera Pavlovna. I'd just gone 
out that day, and it was still early. A student went by and I accosted 
him. He said nothing, but crossed to the other side of the street. He 
looked back at me. I ran up to him and seized his hand. ‘No,’ I say, 
‘you're so good looking I won't let you go.’ ‘I beg you to let go of me,’ he 
says. ‘No,’ I reply, ‘come with me.’ ‘No need to,’ he says. ‘Well, then I'll 
go with you. Where are you going? I just won't leave you.’ I was so 
shameless, much worse than the others.” 

“Perhaps, Nastasya Borisovna, you were ashamed because you were 
really very bashful.” 

“Yes, perhaps. At least I’ve observed that in others. Of course, I didn't 
understand it at the time, only much later. So when I said to him that I 
would definitely go with him, he started to laugh and said, ‘Come if 
you want to, but it will be in vain.’ He wanted to teach me a lesson, as 
he explained later. He was annoyed that I was chasing after him. So I 
went along and told him all sorts of nonsense. He was silent. We 
arrived at his place. For a student he was living comfortably even then. 
He received twenty rubles a month from his lessons and at the time he 
was living alone. I sprawled on his sofa and said, ‘Well, give me some 
wine.’ ‘No,’ he says, ‘I won't give you any wine, but you may have some 
tea if you'd like.’ ‘With punch,’!27 I said. ‘No, without.’ I began to do all 
sorts of foolish things, behaving in a shameless manner. He sat there 
staring straight ahead, not paying me any attention; this irked me. 
Nowadays one can meet lots of young men like him, Vera Pavlovna. 
Recently young men have gotten a lot better; such a man used to be a 
rare find. But even this was insulting, so I started to abuse him. ‘If 
you're going to be so wooden,’ I said, adding some insult, ‘then I’m 
going to leave.’ ‘Why leave now?’ he said. ‘Have some tea. The landlady 
will bring the samovar any minute. But no more abuse.’ He addressed 
me using only polite forms.!28 ‘Why don't you tell me who you are and 
how this happened to you.’ 

“So I began to tell him a story that I'd thought up. We all make up 
different stories and that’s why no one ever believes us. But there are 


127. An alcoholic drink made of rum boiled with sugar, water, and fruit flavoring. 
128. See n. 54 above. 


What Is to Be Done? 223 


some girls who don't make up stories: there are in fact some wellborn 
and well-educated girls among us. He listened and said, ‘No, that isn't 
a very good story. As much as I'd like to believe it, I can’t.’ We were 
already drinking our tea. Then he said, ‘Do you know what I can see 
from your constitution? Drinking is bad for you. Your lungs have prob- 
ably been affected by it already. Why don't you let me examine you?’ 
Well, Vera Pavlovna, you won't believe it, but I was embarrassed! And 
what kind of life had I been leading? I'd been behaving so shamelessly 
just before. He noticed this and said, ‘No, I only want to examine your 
lungs.’ Although he was only in the second year at school, he already 
knew a great deal of medicine; he was way ahead in science. He 
listened to my chest. ‘You know,’ he said, ‘you shouldn't drink at all. 
Your lungs are in bad shape.’ ‘What? Not drink?’ I said. ‘That's not 
possible for the likes of us!’ It really isn't, Vera Pavlovna. ‘Well,’ he said, 
‘then give up that sort of life.’ ‘Why should I give it up? It’s fun!’ ‘No,’ he 
said, ‘it’s not much fun. Now I have to get to work. Run along.’ So I left, 
angry that the evening had been wasted. I was also offended that he 
was so unresponsive. We have our pride, you know. 

“Well, about a month later I happened to be in that neighborhood 
again. ‘I'll just drop in on that wooden fellow,’ I thought, ‘and have 
some fun with him!’ It was just before dinner. I was feeling well rested 
from the night before and wasn’t drunk yet. He was sitting with a book. 
‘Hello there, you wooden creature.’ ‘Hello,’ he said, ‘how are you?’ I 
started behaving foolishly again. ‘I'll chase you away,’ he said. ‘Stop it. I 
told you I don't like it. You're not drunk now, so you can understand. 
Better listen to what I have to say: your face looks sicker than before. 
You must give up drinking. Straighten up your clothes and let’s have a 
good chat!’ Indeed, my chest had already begun to ache. He examined 
me again and said that my lungs were much worse. He said a great 
deal. My chest was so painful that I broke down and cried. I didn’t 
want to die. Why was he scaring me with all that talk of consumption? 
I said to him, ‘How can I give up this kind of life? ‘The madam won't 
release me. I owe her seventeen rubles.’ They keep us constantly in 
debt so that we have no other choice. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘I don’t have 
seventeen rubles right now, but come again the day after tomorrow.’ 
That seemed so strange to me! That wasn’t at all why I'd said it. And 
how could I have expected it anyway? I couldn't quite believe what I'd 
heard. I cried all the more, thinking he was making fun of me. ‘It’s a sin 
to abuse a poor girl when you can see she’s crying,’ I said. I didn't 
believe him for the longest time, even when he assured me that he was 
in earnest. And what do you think? He got hold of the money and two 
days later handed it over to me. I could hardly believe it even then. ‘But 
how on earth?’ I said. ‘Why on earth are you doing this if you want 
nothing from me?’ 

“I paid off the madam and rented myself a room. But there was 


to

ry

nothing else I could do. We're issued special passports.!29 What can 
you possibly do then? I had no money. So, I resumed my previous 
life—no, not exactly. What a difference, Vera Pavlovna! I received only 
certain aquaintances, those men I knew to be good, who wouldn't 
abuse me. And I didn't drink. ‘That's why it was so different. Compared 
to my previous life, it was easy for me. No, it was still difficult. Here’s 
what I want to say: you may think it was difficult because I had so 
many male friends—five or so. But I was fond of them all; that wasn’t 
it. Forgive me for saying so, but I’m being honest with you. And I still 
think that. You know me. Am I immodest now? Who's heard anything 
but good of me? I spend a lot of time with the children in the work- 
shop. Everyone likes me. The old women can't claim that I've taught 
them anything bad. But to be honest with you, Vera Pavlovna, I still 
think that. If you're fond of a man, then there's no harm, provided 
there’s no deceit. It's a different story if there’s deceit. 

“That's how I lived. Three months passed and I was able to get some 
rest because my life was so calm. Although I felt guilty about money 
being involved, I no longer considered myself a wicked girl. 

“But Sashenka used to visit me at that time, Vera Pavlovna, and I 
would visit him. Now I've returned to the main subject that I should 
have been talking about all along. He didn’t come for the same reason 
as the others, but to make sure I hadn't returned to my previous 
weakness and started drinking wine again. Indeed, during the first few 
days he gave me support because | felt a strong craving for it. But I was 
ashamed: what if he came by and saw me? Undoubtedly I couldn't 
have resisted without his help because my friends, all good people, 
would say, ‘I'll send for some wine.’ But I was so ashamed before him 
that I said, ‘No, you mustn't.’ Or else I would have been tempted. The 
idea that wine was harmful to me would not have been enough. ‘Then 
after about three weeks, I began to grow stronger. My craving for wine 
passed, and I abandoned my drunken ways. All the while I was saving 
up money to pay him back. In about two months I repaid the full 
amount. He was so happy that I did. The next day he brought me some 
muslin for a dress and a few other things that he’d bought with that 
money. He used to visit me after that, still only as a doctor looking after 
a patient. Then, about a month after I'd repaid him, during one of his 
visits he suddenly said, ‘You know, Nastenka, now I am starting to find 
you attractive. Indeed, wine can spoil one’s looks, and the effect 
doesn’t fade at once; but by then it had, and my face had become more 
delicate, my eyes clearer. ‘Then too, I'd given up my old habits and 
begun to talk modestly. Do you know that my ideas became more 
modest as soon as I stopped drinking? I would still get words mixed 

129. To control the spread of venereal diseases, prostitutes in prerevolutionary Russia

(“yellow tickets”) attesting to their “health.”

up and sometimes I lapsed into absent-mindedness from my former 
slovenliness. But by then I was getting accustomed to behaving myself 
and talking more modestly. As soon as he said that he was starting to 
find me attractive, I was so happy that I wanted to throw myself on his 
neck, but I didn’t dare. He said, ‘So you see, Nastenka, I'm not so 
unresponsive?’ He said that I'd become sweet and modest, and he 
began to caress me. How? He took my hand and placed it on his and 
then began to stroke mine with his other hand. All the while he was 
looking at my hand. In fact, at that time my hands were very white and 
delicate. As soon as he took my hand (you won't believe it), I blushed. 
After my life, Vera Pavlovna, it was strange to be acting like an innocent 
young maiden, but that’s what happened. In spite of my embarrass- 
ment (it’s amusing to say it, Vera Pavlovna, but in spite of my embar- 
rassment, that’s the truth!), I said to him, ‘Why are you befriending me, 
Alexander Matveich?’ He replied, ‘Because you’re an honest woman 
now, Nastenka.’ Those words, calling me an honest woman, made me 
so happy that I burst into tears. Then he asked, ‘What's the matter, 
Nastenka?’ He kissed me. And do you know what? As a result of that 
kiss my head started to spin, and I fainted. Can you believe it, Vera 
Pavlovna, can you believe that such a thing could happen to me after 
the life I'd led? 

“The next morning I was sitting at home weeping, wondering what I 
could do now, a poor creature, how could I live? The only choice was 
to throw myself into the Neva. I felt that I couldn't go on living the way 
I had been. Come what may, I might starve to death, but I couldn't go 
on. You see, this meant I'd been in love with him for some time. But 
since he'd shown me no affection whatever and I'd had no hope that 
he'd ever find me attractive, this love had died away within me. I 
wasn't even aware that it still existed. But now it all came to light again. 
Naturally, when you feel that kind of love, how can you look at anyone 
else except the man you love? You yourself feel that it’s impossible. 
Everything else disappears, except that one man. So there I sat and 
wept, wondering what I could do and how I could live. And I'd really 
made up my mind to go and see him once more and then drown 
myself. I cried the whole morning. Then suddenly I noticed that he’d 
come in. He began to kiss me and said, ‘Nastenka, will you come live 
with me?’ I told him what I'd been thinking about. Then we started to 
live together. 

“That was such a happy time, Vera Pavlovna. I think there are very 
few people who can have enjoyed such happiness. How he liked look- 
ing at me! Many times I'd wake up and he'd be sitting there with a 
book. He’d come over to look at me and would forget all about the 
book and just sit there looking. But he was so modest, Vera Pavlovna. I 
could understand that later, when I began to read and find out how 
love is described in novels; only then was | able to judge. But with all 


226 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


his modesty, he still loved to feast his eyes on me. What a feeling when 
the man you love is looking at you with delight! It's a joy that one can 
hardly imagine. Like the first time he kissed me: my head started to 
spin, and] sank into his embrace. You would think the feeling is sweet, 
but it’s not; it’s not that at all. Then, you see, your blood is boiling and 
you feel anxious; in that sweet feeling there’s some element of torment 
so that it’s even a bit painful. Of course, it goes without saying that it’s 
sheer bliss; one might easily sacrifice one’s life for such a moment— 
and people do, Vera Pavlovna. It’s sheer bliss, but that’s not it either; 
that’s not it at all. It’s just the same when you sit alone daydreaming 
and think, ‘Oh, how I love him!’ But then there’s no anxiety, no pain in 
that pleasure; you feel so calm and so quiet. Well, it’s just like that, only 
a thousand times stronger when the man you love looks at you loving- 
ly. You feel such serenity. It’s not that your heart is pounding. No, that 
would mean you were experiencing some anxiety. Rather it’s beating 
evenly, pleasantly, softly; your chest becomes broader, you breathe 
more easily. Yes, that’s the truth; it’s very easy to breathe. Oh, how easy 
it is! Thus an hour or two pass by like a single minute; no, not a 
minute, not a second—no time at all. It’s just like when you fall asleep 
and then wake up. When you do, you know that a great deal of time 
has passed since you fell asleep. How did this time pass? It wasn’t 
even a single moment. And it’s just like awakening after a long sleep: 
you feel no exhaustion, only freshness and energy—as if you've had a 
good rest. And so it is: you've had a good rest. I said, ‘It’s very easy to 
breathe.’ That's the most genuine feeling. What power there is in his 
glance, Vera Pavlovna. No other caress can comfort you in that way or 
give you such pleasure as his glance. Of all the things that make up 
love, there’s nothing else so tender. 

“How he loved to look at me! How he feasted his eyes on me! Oh, 
what rapture! No one can imagine it who hasn’t experienced it for 
herself. But you know all this, Vera Pavlovna. 

“And how is it that he never tired of kissing my eyes and my hands; 
then he starts kissing my breast, my feet, everything. How is it that I 
feel no shame when I'd already become the kind of girl then that I am 
now? You know, Vera Pavlovna, that a look from another woman em- 
barrasses me. Our girls will tell you how bashful I am. That’s why I live 
in a separate room. How strange it is, quite beyond belief, but when he 
looks at me and kisses me, I feel no shame. It’s so pleasant and so easy 
to breathe. Why is it, Vera Pavlovna, that I'm embarrassed by other 
girls, but feel no shame at his glance? Perhaps it’s because he no 
longer seems to be another person; we've become one and the same. 
It's as if he weren't looking at me, but I was looking at myself, as if he 
weren't kissing me, but I was kissing myself. That’s just how I imagine 
it, and that’s why I feel no shame. But you know all this. There’s no

myself away from the thought. No, I'll go now, Vera Pavlovna. It's 
impossible to talk about anything else at the moment. I merely wanted 
to tell you how kind Sashenka is.” 


XV. 


Kryukova finished telling her story to Vera Pavlovna during the days 
that followed. She lived with Kirsanov for about two years. The symp- 
toms of her illness seemed to have disappeared. ‘Then, at the end of 
the second year, just as spring was arriving, her consumption sud- 
denly manifested itself in the late stages of development. Had she 
continued to live with Kirsanov, Kryukova would have been condemn- 
ing herself to an early death. If she separated from him, she might be 
able to count on another period of remission. They decided to part. If 
she took up some demanding work, that would also mean her end. 
She had to find a position as a housekeeper, maid, or nanny— 
something of that sort, and in a household where there’d be no ex- 
hausting obligations and, even more important, no unpleasantness. 
Rather rare conditions, these! But a suitable position was found. Kir- 
sanov had some acquaintances who were budding actors. Through 
them Kryukova was hired as a maid by an actress in the Russian 
theater,!3° an excellent woman. Oh, how many times did Nastya and 
Kirsanov say farewell ... and each time they changed their minds. 
“Tomorrow I shall leave to take up my position,” she would say. But 
one tomorrow followed another. They cried and wept in each other's 
arms; the actress, who knew the circumstances surrounding her new 
maid, finally came to fetch her. She had guessed why her maid was so 
late in appearing; she carried her away from the prolonged farewell 
that threatened her health. 

As long as the actress remained on stage, Kryukova lived very well. 
The actress was a sensitive woman, and Kryukova valued her 
position—it would have been hard to find another like it. Since she 
never experienced any unpleasantness with the actress, Kryukova 
soon became quite attached to her. Seeing this, the actress became 
even kinder to her. Kryukova lived a tranquil existence; there was very 
little development of her disease, almost none. But then the actress got 
married, left the stage, and settled in her husband's household. There, 
as Vera Pavlovna had previously heard, the husband’s father began to 
make advances to the maid. Kryukova’s virtue was not, it must be said, 
subject to temptation, but a domestic quarrel ensued. The former 
actress started to shame the old man, and the father began to get 
angry. Kryukova did not wish to be the cause of a family squabble.

Petersburg in 1832.

Even if she did, she couldn't have lived tranquilly in that position; so 
she left it. 

That was about two and a half years after her parting from Kirsanov. 
She hadn't been seeing him at all during this time. At first he used to 
visit her; but her joy at their meeting had such a detrimental effect on 
her that he asked her permission to cease his visits for her own good. 
Then Kryukova tried to work as a maid in two or three other house- 
holds; but she found so much anxiety and unpleasantness everywhere 
that it became preferable to hire herself out as a seamstress, even 
though it meant condemning herself to the rapid development of the 
disease. It would have progressed all the same as a consequence of 
any unpleasantness; it was better to suffer the same fate without bit- 
terness, as a result of the work alone. A year as a seamstress com- 
pletely undermined Kryukova’s health. When she entered Vera Pavlov- 
na's workshop, Lopukhov, who was their house doctor, did everything 
possible to slow the course of her consumption. He did a great deal, 
that is, a great deal if one considers the difficulty involved in obtaining 
even these meager results. Her end was fast approaching. 

Until recently Kryukova had been living under the usual delusion of 
consumptive patients, imagining that her disease had not progressed 
very far; therefore she did not seek out Kirsanov for fear of his injurious 
effect on her. But about two months ago she began to press Lopukhov 
to tell her how long she had left to live. She didn’t say why she wanted 
to know; Lopukhov, who saw nothing in her questions except the 
usual attachment to life, didn't consider it his right to tell her how 
near the crisis really was. He reassured her. But, as most often hap- 
pens, she wasn't reassured and merely refrained from doing the one 
thing that might have afforded her some joy at the end. She knew that 
she didn't have long to live; all her feelings were determined by that 
thought, but the doctor convinced her that she must still take care of 
herself. She knew that she had to trust him more than herself. There- 
fore, she listened to him and didn't seek out Kirsanov. 

Of course, this misunderstanding couldn't last for very long. As the 
crisis approached, Kryukova’s questions would have become more 
persistent. Either she would have revealed that she had a special 
reason for wanting to know the truth or else Lopukhov or Vera Pavlov- 
na would have guessed that there was a particular urgency in her 
inquiries. Then, two or three weeks later, perhaps only a few days 
later, the result would have been exactly the same as what actually 
happened a little earlier and somewhat unexpectedly for Kryukova, 
thanks to Kirsanov’s appearance in the workshop. But now the misun- 
derstanding was over, as a result not of the further course of her 
questions but of an accidental circumstance. 

“How happy I am, how very happy! I kept meaning to come and see 


What Is to Be Done? 229 


you, Sashenka!” cried Kryukova ecstatically when she led him to her 
room. 

“Yes, Nastenka, and I’m just as happy as you are! Now we'll never be 
parted. Come and live with me,” said Kirsanov, overcome by a feeling 
of compassionate love. Having said it, he suddenly thought, “How 
could I have said that? She’s probably not aware that the end is so 
near.” 

But either she didn’t understand the meaning of his words at first or 
she understood but didn't bother to pay any attention to the meaning. 
Her joy at the resumption of their love stifled any sorrow at the 
thought of her impending doom. Whichever it was, she was overjoyed 
and said, “What a kind man you are to love me the way you did 
before.” 

But when he left, she did cry a little; it was only now that she 
grasped, or was able to realize that she grasped, the meaning of the 
resumption of their love: “There’s no reason to protect you now—it 
won't do any good. At least have some joy while you can.” 

And she really was very happy. He didn’t leave her for a moment, 
except for those hours he had to spend in the hospital or the Acade- 
my. Thus she lived for almost a month. They were together all the 
time. They told many stories, about what each had been doing during 
the time of their separation, recalling even more often the pleasures of 
their previous life. They took walks together; he hired a carriage, and 
every evening they rode through the outskirts of Petersburg and ad- 
mired them. People find nature so pleasant that they enjoy even the 
pitiful, miserable scenery around Petersburg, which cost millions and 
tens of millions of rubles. They read together, played cards and lotto; 
she even began to learn how to play chess, as if she had the time to 
master the game. 

On several occasions Vera Pavlovna spent late evenings with them 
after they returned from one of their outings, or, more often, she 
dropped by during the morning to distract Kryukova when she was 
left alone. When the two women were alone together, Kryukova would 
talk, at length and passionately, about nothing but how kind and 
tender Sashenka was, and how much he loved her. 


XVi. 


Four months or so passed. Kirsanov was deceived first by his wor- 
ries about Kryukova, then by his memories of her. It seemed to him 
that now he was out of danger as far as Vera Pavlovna was concerned. 
He didn't avoid her during her visits to Kryukova, when she met him 
and spoke to him, or afterward, when she tried to distract him. And, in 


230 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


fact, while he was in mourning, he wasn’t aware of having any feelings 
for Vera Pavlovna, except that of friendly gratitude for all her help. 

But—(the reader already knows the meaning of this “but,” just as 
you always know “beforehand” what's going to happen following the 
pages you've just read)—but, of course Kirsanov's feeling for Kryukova 
at the time of their second meeting wasn't at all like hers for him. Any 
love for Kryukova had long since passed. He merely remained fond of 
her, as one does of a former lover. His previous love was only a result of 
his youthful desire to love someone, anyone at all. Naturally, Kryukova 
was no match for him because they were really no match for each 
other as far as their development was concerned. When he outgrew 
his youth, he could feel sorry for her, but no more. He could be tender 
to her for memory’s sake or out of compassion, but that’s all. Indeed, 
his grief at losing her faded away very quickly; but even after the grief 
had disappeared, he imagined that he was still preoccupied with it. 
When he noticed that he no longer felt any grief but merely recalled it, 
he saw that he'd become quite involved with Vera Pavlovna and that 
he’d come upon a great misfortune. 

Vera Pavlovna tried to distract him; he allowed himself to be dis- 
tracted, considering that he was in no danger. Perhaps he didn't real- 
ize that he was in love with Vera Pavlovna, and that in submitting to 
her care, he was courting disaster. And what was happening now, 
some two or three months after Vera Pavlovna had begun to distract 
him from his grief over Kryukova? Nothing more than that all during 
this period he spent almost every evening at the Lopukhovs'’ or else he 
escorted Vera Pavlovna somewhere, sometimes with her husband but 
more frequently without. That's all there was to it. But it was more 
than enough not only for him but for her as well. 

What is Vera Pavlovna’s day like now? Up until evening it’s the same 
as before. But now it’s about six o'clock. Previously she would go to the 
workshop alone or sit in her room working. But now, if she has to visit 
the workshop in the evening, Kirsanov has been told the day before, 
and he arrives in time to escort her. Along the way, both there and 
back (not a very long trip), they chat about something or other, usually 
the workshop. Kirsanov is now her most active associate in matters 
pertaining to it. Once there she’s occupied giving various instructions, 
while he too has a lot to do. Thirty girls find quite a few favors to ask 
and requests to make; surely it would be convenient for him to assist? 
In between these tasks, he sits chatting with the children. Even here a 
few girls participate in the conversation about everything under 
the sun—how splendid the stories are from The Thousand and 
One Arabian Nights,!3! many of which he'd read to them, or about 

131. The anonymous Arabic literary classic in which the heroine, Scheherazade, re- 


lates a different tale each night to her husband for 1,001 nights to prevent him from 
killing her.

the white elephants that are so esteemed in India (just as many of us 
love white cats). Half the group considers that this shows a lack of 
taste. White elephants, cats, and horses—all are albinos, a sickly 
breed. You can tell from their eyes that they don’t enjoy as good health 
as animals with real color.!3? The other half of the group takes the side 
of the white cats. 

“Do you know any more details about the life of Mrs. Beecher Stowe, 
whose novel we all know from your stories?”!33 asks one of the older 
participants in the discussion. No, Kirsanov doesn’t know anything 
more, but he could find out because he too is curious. But he could 
tell them something about John Howard, who was almost the same 
sort of person as Mrs. Beecher Stowe.!34 Then Kirsanov would tell 
them stories or argue with members of the group, the junior half of 
which is always the same, while the senior half constantly changes. 

After Vera Pavlovna has finished her business, she returns home 
with him to have tea. The three of them sit together for a long time 
afterward. Nowadays Vera Pavlovna and Dmitry Sergeich spend much 
more time over their tea than they did before Kirsanov joined them. 

An hour or sometimes two of almost every evening the three of them 
spend together without other company are devoted to some musical 
activity. Dmitry Sergeich plays and Vera Pavlovna sings, while Kirsanov 
sits and listens. Sometimes Kirsanov plays; then Dmitry Sergiech sings 
together with his wife. 

But it often happens nowadays that Vera Pavlovna hurries home 
from the workshop to dress for the theater. They frequent the opera 
now, about half the time all three of them together, the other half, just 
Kirsanov and Vera Pavlovna. Besides, the Lopukhovs have started to 
entertain guests more often. Previously, except for some young people 
(And what sort of guests are they? More like one’s own nephews!), the 
Mertsalovs were their only guests. But now the Lopukhovs have be- 
come close to two or three other nice couples. The Mertsalovs and two 
couples have agreed to take turns organizing little evening parties with 
dancing for their circle every week. Sometimes there are six couples 
present, even as many as eight. Lopukhov never goes to the opera 
without Kirsanov, or to visit other couples, but Kirsanov often escorts 
Vera Pavlovna alone on these outings. Lopukhov says that he prefers to

stay at home in his everyday clothes on his own sofa. ‘Therefore, they 
spend only about half their evenings as a threesome; but at such times 
they're together without interruption. It’s true that when the Lopu- 
khovs are entertaining no other guests besides Kirsanov, the sofa often 
draws Lopukhov away from the room where the piano is. It's now 
been moved from Vera Pavlovna’s room into the living room, although 
this fact doesn’t really help Dmitry Sergeich much. Within a quarter of 
an hour or at most half an hour, Kirsanov and Vera Pavlovna have also 
abandoned the piano and are sitting next to him on the sofa. In fact, 
Vera Pavlovna doesn’t sit there for long; she soon manages to recline 
on the sofa, but in such a way that her husband isn’t disturbed in the 
least. It's a large sofa; that is, it’s really not all that spacious, but she's 
slipped one arm around her husband, and therefore he’s still comfort- 
able sitting there. 

Thus pass another three or more months. 

The idyll is no longer in fashion, and I myself don't like it very much, 
that is, I personally don't like it, just as I don’t like taking walks or 
eating asparagus. There’s a lot I don't like! But it’s impossible for any 
one person to like every kind of food and all forms of recreation. Yet I 
know that these things, although not to my personal taste, are very 
good things and that they are to the liking, or would be, of a much 
greater number of people than those who, like me, prefer a game of 
chess to taking a walk or a plate of sauerkraut with hempseed oil to 
asparagus. I even know that the majority, who doesn't share my pen- 
chant for a game of chess and would be glad not to share my enthusi- 
asm for sauerkraut with hempseed oil, has tastes no worse than mine. 
Therefore I say, take as many walks as you like, and let sauerkraut with 
hempseed oil disappear from the face of the earth, as long as there 
remains just a little left as an antiquarian relic for a few eccentrics like 
me! 

Similarly I know that for the vast majority of people no worse than I 
am, happiness must have its idyllic character. So I exclaim, let the 
idyllic character of life reign over all others! For a few eccentrics who 
aren't fond of idylls, there'll be other kinds of happiness, but the ma- 
jority requires the idyll. And as for the fact that it’s no longer fashion- 
able and therefore people spurn it, that’s no real objection at all. They 
shun the idyll as the fox in the fable spurned the grapes.'*5 They think 
it inaccessible; consequently they conclude, “Let it no longer be fash- 
ionable.” 

But it’s pure nonsense that the idyll is inaccessible. It’s not only a 
fine thing for almost all people, but even feasible, very much so. It 
wouldn't be all that difficult to establish—not just for one person or 


135. In Aesop's fable “The Fox and the Grapes,” the fox convinces himself that some 
tasty-looking grapes are unpalatable merely because they are beyond his reach.

even for a dozen men, but for all people. Why, it’s impossible for five 
people to sustain the Italian opera, but it’s entirely feasible for all of 
Petersburg to do it, as everyone can see and hear.!36 Why, the Com- 
plete Collected Works of N. V. Gogol (Moscow, 1861) is impossible for a 
dozen people to sustain, but for the whole reading public it’s entirely 
feasible and not even expensive, as everyone knows. But until there 
was Italian opera for the whole town, only a few odd concerts were 
available to particularly devoted music lovers; until the second part of 
Dead Souls was published for the whole reading public, only a few 
particularly devoted admirers of Gogol were able to prepare their own 
handwritten copies, despite the labor involved.!37 A handwritten 
manuscript can't compare to a printed book; a few odd concerts are 
no match for the Italian opera. But still, they’re both good, each in its 
own way.

If an outsider had come to consult with Kirsanov about the position 
in which he found himself when he came to his senses, and if Kirsanov 
had been a total stranger to all those involved in the affair, he’d have 
said to the outsider, “It’s too late to remedy the situation by running 
away. I don’t know how it will turn out, but it’s equally dangerous both 
to run away and to stay here; as for those whose peace of mind 
concerns you, your running away would be more dangerous than 
staying here.” 

Of course Kirsanov would have said this only to the sort of man who 
was similar to him or Lopukhov, that is, a man of resolute character 
and unfailing honesty. It would be useless to discuss such matters 
with other people, because they’d undoubtedly behave in an abomina- 
ble and worthless way; they'd shame the woman, dishonor them- 
selves, and then go around to their friends whining or boasting, 
savoring either their heroic virtue or their amorous appeal. Neither Lo- 
pukhov nor Kirsanov would enjoy talking with such people about the 
way honorable men should behave. But Kirsanov would be correct in 
telling anyone of his own ilk that running away now would be almost 
worse than staying. The implications would be clear. “I know how 
you'd have to behave if you stayed: so as not to reveal your feelings, 


136. An allusion to the popularity of Italian opera among fashionable Petersburg 
society (see also n. 97 above). 

137. The date of publication given by Chernyshevsky is inaccurate. Multivolume edi- 
tions of Gogol’s collected works were published in 1842, 1857, and 1862. Although Gogol 
burned most of the second part of his masterpiece Dead Souls (vol. 1, 1842; vol. 2, 1855), 
fragments of it survived and circulated among intellectuals in manuscript form until it 
was published in 1855. 


234 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


since that’s the only way you could stay and not become a scoundrel. 
The task before you is to disrupt as little as possible the serenity of a 
woman whose life is going along smoothly. It already seems impossi- 
ble not to disrupt it at all. The feeling that’s incompatible with her 
present relations has probably (why say ‘probably’— it’s better to say 
‘undoubtedly’ arisen in her already, but she hasn't noticed it quite yet. 
It’s not yet known whether it will manifest itself to her soon without 
your instigation. But your departure now would serve as that instiga- 
tion. In other words, your departure would merely hasten the very 
process you seek to avoid.” 

However, Kirsanov was considering this affair not as an outsider but 
as a participant. He imagined that it would be harder to leave than to 
remain. His feelings were inducing him to stay. Consequently, 
wouldn't that mean submitting to those feelings, yielding to desire, if 
he stayed? What right did he have to believe so absolutely that he 
would not reveal his feelings or provide any instigation by a word or a 
glance? Therefore, it would be wiser to leave. In one’s own affairs it's 
difficult to distinguish how much one’s reason has been seduced by 
the sophistries of desire, because honesty is saying, “If you go against 
desire, you'll have a greater chance of behaving in an honorable way.” 
This represents a translation from theoretical language into ordinary 
speech. The theory that Kirsanov advocated considers fine words such 
as “honorable” to be ambiguous and obscure. In his own terminology 
Kirsanov would have expressed himself thus: “Every man is an egoist 
and so am I. Now the question is, what's most advantageous for me, to 
leave or to stay? By leaving, I'll suppress one private feeling in myself; 
by staying, I risk upsetting my sense of human dignity by a stupid 
word or glance occasioned by that particular feeling. That feeling can 
be suppressed; in time my serenity will be restored and I'll once again 
be content with my life. But if ] ever act against my own human nature, 
then once and for all I shall forfeit the possibility of serenity and self- 
satisfaction and will poison my entire life. My position is like this: | 
love wine. Before me stands a glass containing some very good wine, 
but I suspect that the glass has been poisoned. I can't determine 
whether my suspician is well founded or not. Should I drink the glass 
or spill it out so that it no longer tempts me? I mustn't call my decision 
honorable or even honest—these words are too grand. I'll call it mere- 
ly calculated and sensible. I spill out the glass. In doing so I deprive 
myself of some pleasure and cause myself some displeasure, but I 
protect my health, that is, the possibility of drinking much more wine 
for a very long time—wine that I'll know for sure hasn’t been poi- 
soned. I'm not behaving foolishly; and that’s all the praise I deserve.” 


What Is to Be Done? 235

How could he withdraw? His previous trick of pretending to be 
offended, displaying some vulgar side of his character and using it as a 
dodge—all that would never do. You couldn't try the same thing 
twice. The second time would merely reveal the true meaning of the’ 
first and show him to be acting the hero not only in these new circum- 
stances but in the previous ones as well. And, in general, it was neces- 
sary to reject any abrupt break in their relations. Such a departure 
would be easier, but it would be too dramatic and attract attention, 
that is, it would now be too base and vulgar (according to Kirsanov’s 
theory of egoism, it would be a foolish miscalculation). Consequently, 
only one, the most difficult and painful way, remained: a quiet with- 
drawal in a slow, unobtrusive manner, in such a way that no one 
would even notice that he was leaving. This was a difficult and a 
delicate matter—to disappear from sight so that no one noticed your 
movements, even though all eyes were focused on you. But there was 
nothing else to be done. He had to do it. Besides, according to Kir- 
sanov’s theory, it shouldn't be painful, but even pleasant. The more 
difficult a task, the more one delights (according to egoism) in one’s 
strength and agility at accomplishing it successfully. 

And he accomplished it very successfully indeed. He didn’t betray 
his intention by a single word, either implied or stated, or by a single 
glance. He was as free and jovial with Vera Pavlovna as ever; it was 
obvious that he enjoyed her company as much as before. But various 
obstacles arose which began to prevent him from visiting the Lopu- 
khovs as often as he used to, or from spending the entire evening with 
them. Somehow it seemed that more often than ever Lopukhov would 
grab him by the arm or by the lapel and say, “No, friend, you can't get 
away from this debate just yet.” More and more of the time that Kir- 
sanov spent at the Lopukhovs’ turned out to be at his friend’s side on 
the sofa. And all this came about so gradually, no one noticed the 
change as it was occurring. When obstacles arose, Kirsanov refrained 
from exaggerating them; on the contrary, he regretted them (but not 
every time—that would never do). The obstacles appeared so natural 
and unavoidable that sometimes the Lopukhovs themselves would 
urge him to leave, reminding him that he'd forgotten his promise to be 
at home today, because he was expecting certain acquaintances of 
whom he'd been unable to rid himself. Or he’d forget that today, if he 
didn’t call in on So-and-so, that person would take offense. Or he'd 
forget that he'd at least four hours of work left to do before morning; 
didn’t he want to get any sleep at all that night? Why, it was ten o’clock 
already! What was he doing there fooling around with them? It was 
high time for him to head home and get to work! Kirsanov didn’t even 
heed their reminders all the time. He just wouldn't go to see his 


236 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


acquaintance: let the fellow get angry! Or the work wouldn't go away— 
there was still time to do it, and he’d spend the rest of the evening 
with them. But these obstacles kept mounting. Learned pursuits all 
the more persistently took Kirsanov away evening after evening. “The 
devil take these learned pursuits!” he’d occasionally and casually ex- 
claim. Meanwhile his acquaintances imposed more and more obliga- 
tions on him. “And what obligations,” he'd sometimes, also casually, 
complain. While it seemed a bit odd to him, it was all perfectly clear to 
the Lopukhovs: Kirsanov was becoming better known. That’s why in- 
creasing numbers of people were requiring his services. And he 
couldn't neglect his work; it would be a mistake to slack off. Indeed, 
he'd been so lazy during the last few months that it would be difficult 
for him to get back to work again. “But you really must, brother Alex- 
ander.” “Yes, it’s high time you did, Alexander Matveich!” 

This maneuver was a difficult one. Week after week it was necessary 
to drag out this about-face and move as slowly and smoothly as the 
hour hand on a clock. Look at it as attentively as you please, you won't 
see it budge, but it goes about its business very quietly all the same, 
moving ever so slowly away from its previous position. On the other 
hand, Kirsanov the theoretician derived immense enjoyment from the 
exercise, admiring his own agility. Egoists and materialists act only to 
satisfy themselves! Yes—and Kirsanov could swear, placing his hand 
on his heart, that he was acting only to satisfy himself. He rejoiced at 
his skill and his mettle. 

Thus passed a month, perhaps a little more. If someone had been 
reckoning, he would have found that during that month Kirsanov's 
intimacy with the Lopukhovs diminished not in the least, although the 
time he spent with them had been reduced to a quarter of its previous 
level; and of that time, the proportion spent with Vera Pavlovna had 
been reduced by another half. In another month, in spite of their 
unwavering friendship, these friends would see very little of each 
other—and it would be in the bag! 

“Lopukhov has sharp eyes. Surely he’s noticed something!” 

“No, not a thing.” 

“What about Vera Pavlovna?” 

“No, she hasn't noticed anything, either.” 

“Has she noticed anything in herself?” 

“No, Vera Pavlovna hasn't noticed anything in herself, either. But she 
does have a dream.” 


xix. Vera Pavlovna’'s Third Dream 


And Vera Pavlovna has a dream. 
After tea and a brief chat with her “sweetheart,” she’s returned to 


What Is to Be Done? 237 


her own room to lie down—not to sleep, for it was much too early for 
that. Why, it was only half past eight! No, she hasn’t even gotten un- 
dressed. She simply lies down to read. And there she is on her bed 
reading; but soon the book slips from her hands and Vera Pavlovna 
begins to ponder: “Why have I been feeling a little bored lately? Per- 
haps it’s not boredom at all, but nothing in particular. No, it’s not 
boredom. Today I simply remembered that I wanted to go to the 
opera, but Kirsanov was so preoccupied that he was too late to buy 
any tickets. As if he didn’t know that when Bosio is singing, it’s impos- 
sible to get two-ruble tickets by eleven o’clock.!38 Of course, one can't 
blame him: he was at work until five o’clock this morning; surely it was 
almost five, even though he wouldn't admit it. . . . Still, it is his fault. 
Yes, from now on I shall ask my sweetheart to buy the tickets and shall 
go to the opera with him. My sweetheart would never forget, and he’s 
always glad to accompany me. He’s so sweet, my sweetheart. And now, 
on account of Kirsanov, I missed hearing La Traviata.139 How awful! I'd 
go to the opera every night if there were a performance every night— 
any opera at all, no matter how bad, as long as Bosio were singing the 
main role. If I had a voice like hers, I would sing all day long. I wonder 
if I could ever get to meet her? How could it be arranged? That artillery 
officer is friendly with Tamberlick!#°—perhaps he could arrange it. 
No, that’s impossible. What a peculiar idea! Why should I want to meet 
Bosio? Would she really sing for me? Surely she has to save her voice. 

“And when did Bosio ever have time to learn Russian? How clear her 
pronunciation is! But what funny words! Where did she unearth such 
vulgar doggerel? Why, yes, she must have used the same Russian 
textbook I did. Those very same verses were quoted to illustrate the 
rules of punctuation. How absurd to include such lines in a grammar 
book! If only they hadn't been so vulgar! But there’s no reason to think 
about the words; instead one should listen to how she sings: 


Seize, oh, seize 
The hour of delight; 
Give up to love 
The years of youth... .141 


138. In the late 1850s the celebrated Italian mezzo soprano Angiolina Bosio (1830— 
1859) performed regularly in St. Petersburg, where she enjoyed considerable popularity 
among operagoers and, thanks to her frequent appearances at charitable events, stu- 
dents and radical intellectuals. 

139. Verdi's opera was first performed in St. Petersburg in Italian in 1856 and in 
Russian in 1858. 

140. The Italian tenor Enrico Tamberlick (1820-1889) performed frequently in St. Pe- 
tersburg, where he enjoyed considerable success, particularly in the role of the Duke in 
Rigoletto (see n. 28 above). 

141. A partially misquoted passage from Pushkin’s lyric poem “To Adele” (1822). Cher- 
nyshevsky substituted the word naslazhden'ya (delight), which actually appears two 
lines earlier, for the word upoen’ya (ecstasy). 


238 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“What strange words: both ‘years’ and ‘youth’ have the wrong ac- 
cents!!42 But what a voice she has, and what feeling! Yes, her voice has 
become much better lately, incomparably so. Miraculous! How could 
it have become so much better? I didn't know how to arrange to meet 
her, but now she herself has come to visit me! How did she learn of my 
desire?” 

“You've been summoning me for some time,” says Bosio in Russian. 

“I, summon you, Bosio? How could that be, when I don't even know 
you? But I'm very glad to see you.” 

Vera Pavlovna parts her bed curtain to shake hands with Bosio, but 
the singer begins to laugh. Why, it isn’t Bosio at all! It turns out to be de 
Merrick playing the gypsy girl in Rigoletto.14+5 Yet while the gay laugh- 
ter is characteristic of de Merrick, the voice still belongs to Bosio. She 
pulls back and hides herself behind the bed curtain. How annoying! 
The curtain hides her, but it wasn't there before! Where did it come 
from? 

“Do you know why I've come?” asks the singer, laughing as if she 
were de Merrick, but still she’s Bosio. 

“Who are you? You're not de Merrick, are you?” 

“No.” 

“Well, are you Bosio?” 

The singer laughs. “You'll find out soon. But for now, we must at- 
tend to my reason for coming. I want to read your diary with you.” 

“I don't have a diary. I've never kept one.” 

“Look here! What's this lying on the table?” 

Vera Pavlovna looks. There on the bedside table lies a notebook 
bearing the inscription “V. L.'s Diary.” Where did it come from? Vera 
Pavlovna picks it up and opens it. It’s written in her own hand. But 
how could that be? 

“Read the last page,” says Bosio. 

Vera Pavlovna reads, “Once again I'm obliged to stay home alone for 
long evenings. But it doesn’t matter; I'm used to it.” 

“Is that all?” asks Bosio. 

“Yes, that’s all.” 

“No, you're not reading everything.” 

“There's nothing more written here.” 

“You won't fool me,” says the visitor. “What's this here?” A hand 
reaches out from behind the bed curtain. What a beautiful hand! No, 
this splendid hand isn’t Bosio’s. And how did it extend through the 
bed curtain without parting it? 


142. Vera Pavlovna is obviously unaware of the older use of the Russian word leto to 
denote “year” as well as “summer.” In the plural, /éta means years and /eta, summers. 

143. The celebrated French soprano Henriette Méric-Lelande (?—1867) performed fre- 
quently in Italian operas in St. Petersburg. 


What Is to Be Done? 239 


The visitor's hand touches the page. Beneath it new words appear 
which weren't there before. “Read,” says the visitor. Vera Pavlovna’s 
heart grows heavy. She hasn’t looked at these lines yet; she doesn’t 
know what's written here; but even so her heart grows heavy. She 
doesn’t want to read these new lines. 

“Read,” insists the visitor. 

Vera Pavlovna reads. “No, it’s so boring to be alone now. It wasn’t 
always so. Why wasn't I bored before when I was alone, but now I am?” 

“Turn back a page,” says the visitor. 

Vera Pavlovna turns back a page and reads, “Summer of this year.” 
What a way to write a diary! I should have written: 1855, June or July, 
and should have marked the date. . . . Instead of that, “Summer of this 
year. As usual we go to the country, to the islands. This time my 
sweetheart is joining us. How nice for me.” “Oh, so it’s August. What 
date? The fifteenth or the twelfth? Yes, sometime around the fifteenth. 
It's that excursion after which my poor sweetheart fell ill,” thinks Vera 
Pavlovna. 

“Is that all?” 

“Yes, that’s all.” 

“No, you're not reading everything. What's this here?” asks the visi- 
tor, and again the splendid hand appears through the unopened bed 
curtain and touches the page. New words appear. Vera Pavlovna reads 
them against her will: “Why doesn’t my sweetheart accompany us 
more often?” 

“Turn to another page,” says the visitor. 

“My sweetheart’'s so busy, and it’s all for my sake. He works for me, 
he does.” “That's the answer to my question,” thinks Vera Pavlovna 
joyfully. 

“Turn to another page.” 

“What honest, noble people these students are, and how they re- 
spect my sweetheart. It’s so amusing to be with them. It’s as if we were 
all brothers and sisters: no one stands on ceremony.” 

“Is that all?” 

“Yes, that’s all.” 

“No, read on.” And again the hand appears and touches the page. 
New lines appear and Vera Pavlovna reads them against her will: “The 
sixteenth of August,” “that is, one day after our trip to the islands,” 
thinks Vera Pavlovna. “That means we went on the fifteenth.” “My 
sweetheart spent the whole time talking to that Rakhmetov, the rigor- 
ist,14 as they refer to him in jest, and to his other comrades. He spent 


144. See n. 104 above. Rakhmetov may have been modeled in part on the radical 
student Dmitry Karakozov (1840-1866), a former student of Chernyshevsky's at the 
Saratov gymnasium who was executed in 1866 after attempting to assassinate Emperor 
Alexander II (see also n. 159 below).

me 


scarcely a quarter of an hour with me.” “That’s not true, more than half 
an hour, | think, yes, more than that, I’m sure,” thinks Vera Pavlovna. 
“Plus the time we sat together in the boat... .” “The seventeenth of 
August. Yesterday the students spent the whole evening with us.” “Yes, 
that was the day before my sweetheart fell ill,” she thinks. “My sweet- 
heart talked to them all evening. Why does he spend so much time 
with them, and so little with me? Surely he’s not working all the time. 
Why, he himself says that he’s not working all the time, that it’s not 
possible to work without relaxation, that he relaxes a good deal, and 
that he thinks about something special to relax. But why does he think 
alone? Why not with me?” 

“Turn to another page.” 

“July, and every other month up to my sweetheart’s illness, the same 
last year, and the same before that, too. The students were here five 
days ago, and yesterday as well. I enjoyed myself with them—it was so 
amusing. They'll come again tomorrow or the day after, and we'll have 
some more fun.” 

“Is that all?” 

“Yes, that's all.” 

“No, read on.” The hand appears again and touches the page. New 
lines emerge beneath it and Vera Pavlovna reads them against her will. 

“The beginning of this year, particularly at the end of spring. Yes, 
previously I enjoyed myself with the students—and that was that. But 
now I often wonder about something. These are merely children’s 
games and will continue to amuse me for a good long time. No doubt 
even when I'm an old lady and too old to play myself, I'll marvel at the 
games of the young which remind me of my own childhood. But even 
now, although I look upon these students as if they were my younger 
brothers, I don’t always want to be ‘little Verochka’ when I seek respite 
from serious thoughts and labors. I’m already ‘Vera Pavlovna’; some- 
times it’s pleasant to amuse myself like little Verochka—but not all the 
time. Vera Pavlovna would sometimes like to amuse herself and still 
remain Vera Pavlovna. It would be with people of the same age and 
experience.”!45 

“Turn back a few more pages.” 

“In a few days I'll be opening a dressmaking establishment. I went to 
see Julie in search of orders. My sweetheart came to fetch me. Julie 
insisted that we stay for luach; she served champagne and prevailed 
upon me to drink two glasses. She and I began to sing, run around,

with children. By contrasting her proper name with its affectionate diminutive, Vera is 
insisting on her own intellectual maturation and personal independence.

and wrestle. It was so much fun. My sweetheart looked on and 
laughed.” 

“Is that really all there is?” asks the visitor. Again new words appear 
beneath her hand and Vera Pavlovna reads them against her will. 

“My sweetheart only looked on and laughed. Why didn’t he join in 
our merriment? It would have been even more fun. Perhaps it would 
have been too awkward? Maybe he wouldn't have known how to take 
part in our games? No, it wouldn’t have been awkward at all, and I'm 
sure he would have known how to play. That’s just his character. He 
doesn't interfere; he encourages and rejoices—but no more.” 

“Turn one page ahead.” 

“Today my sweetheart and I went to visit my parents for the first 
time since we were married. I found it very painful to see the kind of 
life that had so stifled and oppressed me before my marriage. My 
sweetheart! What an abominable existence he delivered me from! That 
night I had a terrible dream. My mother was reproaching me for in- 
gratitude; she was telling the truth, but the truth was so awful that I 
began to moan. My sweetheart heard me and came into my room, but 
by then I was already singing (all of this in my dream), because my 
beloved beautiful woman had come to console me. My sweetheart 
acted like my maid. It was very embarrassing. But he was so modest 
and merely kissed my shoulder.” 

“Is that really all that’s written? You won't fool me. Read on... . 
Once again new words emerge under the visitor's hand and Vera 
Pavlovna reads them against her will. 

“It was almost insulting.” 

“Turn back a few more pages.” 

“Today I was waiting for my friend D. on the boulevard near the 
Novyi [New] Bridge.146 The lady at whose house I hoped to be a gov- 
erness lives nearby. But she didn’t agree to it. D. and I returned home 
despondent. Before dinner I sat in my room and thought that it would 
be better to die than to live as I had, when suddenly, at dinner, D. says, 
‘Vera Pavlovna, let’s drink to the health of my fiancée and your intend- 
ed.’ I could hardly refrain from bursting into tears of joy in front of 
everyone at such unexpected deliverance. After dinner D. and I talked 
at length about how we'd arrange our lives. How I do love him! He's 
leading me out of the cellar.” 

“Read it all.” 

“There is no more.” 

“Look closely.” Again new lines emerge beneath the visitor's hand. 


”

Schmidt Bridge), the first permanent span across the Neva River, built in 1842-1850. 


242 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“I don’t want to read any more,” says Vera Pavlovna in fear. She 
hasn't even managed to decipher what's written in those new lines, 
but she’s already afraid. 

“When I order you to read, you have no choice.” 

Vera Pavlovna reads. 

“Can it be that I love him because he’s leading me out of the cellar? 
Do I really love him or my deliverance from the cellar?” 

“Turn back further. Read the very first page.” 

“Today, on my birthday, I spoke with D. for the first time and fell in 
love with him. I've never before heard such noble, comforting words 
spoken by anyone. How he sympathized with everything that merits 
sympathy; he wants to help anyone who’s in need of help. He’s so 
convinced that happiness is possible for all mankind and that it must 
eventually come into being; that malice and grief are not eternal; and 
that a bright new life is rapidly approaching. How my heart swelled 
with joy when I heard these assurances from such a serious, learned 
man. My own thoughts were confirmed by his words. . . . He was so 
very kind when he spoke about us, poor women. Why, any woman 
would soon come to love such a man! How clever he is, how noble, 
how kind!” 

“Good. Turn again to the last page.” 

“But I’ve read that one already.” 

“No, that wasn’t the last one. Turn one more page.” 

“But there’s nothing here.” 

“Read on! You'll see how much is written there.” And again lines 
that were not there before emerge at a touch of the visitor’s hand. 

Vera Pavlovna’s heart grows cold. 

“I don’t want to read it. I can’t.” 

“It’s an order. You must.” 

“I can’t and I won't.” 

“Then I shall read what you wrote. Listen. 

“He is a noble man;he is my liberator. But nobility inspires respect, 
confidence, friendship, and readiness to act in concert. A liberator is 
rewarded with gratitude and devotion—but that’s all. Perhaps his 
nature is more passionate than mine. When his blood seethes, his 
caresses burn. But there exists another kind of need—a need for quiet, 
calm caresses, and the desire to doze blissfully in a sea of tenderness. 
Does he share this need? Are our natures and needs really compat- 
ible? He’s prepared to die for me, and I for him. But is that enough? Is 
his life sustained by thoughts of me? Is mine nourished by thoughts of 
him? Do I love him with the kind of love I yearn to feel? Previously I 
hadn't recognized the need for this quiet, tender feeling. No, my feel- 
ing for him isn’t...” 


What Is to Be Done? 243 


‘IT don’t want to hear any more!” cries Vera Pavlovna, tossing aside 
the diary with indignation. “You're a vile, wicked creature! Why did 
you come here? I didn’t summon you. Go away!” 

The visitor laughs with a gentle, kind laugh. 

“No, you don’t love him. These words were written by your own 
hand.” 

“I curse you!” 

With this exclamation Vera Pavlovna awakens. Before she realizes 
that she’s been dreaming and has only just awakened, she jumps up 
and runs out of her room. 

“Embrace me, my dear, protect me! I had an awful dream!” She 
snuggles up to her husband. “Caress me, my dear, be tender, protect 
me.” 

“Verochka, what's the matter?” Her husband embraces her. “You're 
trembling.” He kisses her. “You have tears on your cheeks and a cold 
sweat on your brow. And, my dear, you ran in here barefoot across the 
cold floor. I'll kiss your little toes to warm them up.” 

“Yes, caress me, save me! I had a nasty dream. I dreamed that I 
didn't love you.” 

“But, my dear, whom do you love, if not me? No, it was an absurd, 
idle dream!” 

“Yes, I do love you. Only, caress me, kiss me. I do love you and want 
to love you.” 

She holds her husband tightly and snuggles up to him. Soothed by 
his caresses, she falls asleep quietly, still kissing him. 


XX. 


The next morning Dmitry Sergeich had no need to summon his wife 
to tea: she was already there, snuggled up next to him. She was still 
asleep. He looked at her and wondered, “What’s the matter with her? 
Why was she so frightened? What caused that dream?” 

“Stay here, Verochka, I'll fetch you some tea. Don’t get up, my dear, 
I'll bring you the basin and you can wash right here.” 

“Good. I won't get up. I’m so comfortable. I'll just lie here for a while. 
How ingenious you are, dear, and how I do love you. There, I’ve 
washed. Now you can bring me some tea. No, first give me a hug!” Vera 
Pavlovna held her husband in an embrace for quite a long time. “Oh, 
my dear, what a silly girl | am! How] came running in to you! What will 
Masha think? No, we'll hide the fact that I woke up here in your room. 
Fetch my clothes so I can get dressed. Caress me, my dear, caress me. I 
want to love you; I need to love you; I will love you as never before!” 


244 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Vera Pavlovna’s room now stands empty. Without concealing any- 
thing from Masha now, she’s moved into her husband's room. How 
tender he is, how affectionate. “How could I ever think that I didn’t 
love you, my dear? How silly I am!” 

“Verochka, now that you've calmed down a bit, my dear, tell me 
about that dream you had a few nights ago.” 

“Oh, it was all such nonsense. I've already told you all there is to tell. 
I merely dreamed that you weren't caressing me enough. But I feel 
better now. Why haven't we always lived together like this? I never 
would have had such an awful dream. It was a horrible, terrible dream 
and I don’t want to think about it anymore.” 

“But without it we wouldn't be living together as we are now.” 

“That’s true. I’m very grateful to that terrible woman. She really isn't 
so horrible after all, she’s good.” 

“What ‘woman’? Do you have a new friend now in addition to that 
other ‘beautiful woman’ of yours?” 

“Yes, I do.Some other woman came to me with an enchanting voice, 
much better than Bosio’s. And what fine hands she has! Oh, what 
wonderful beauty: her hand was all I saw. The rest of her was hidden 
behind the bed curtain (that’s why I had to leave the place where I had 
that dream). 1 dreamed that there was a bed curtain and that my new 
guest was hiding behind it. What splendid hands she had, my dear! 
She sang to me about love and explained what love is all about. Now I 
understand, my dear. How foolish I was before! I didn’t understand a 
thing. I was such a little girl, a foolish little girl.” 

“My dear, my angel, there’s a time for everything. The way we were 
living before was love, and the way we are living now is also love. Some 
people need one kind of love, other people need a different kind. 
Before, one kind of love was enough; now you need another. Yes, 
you've become a woman now, my friend. You need something now 
that you never needed before.” 


A week passes. Two weeks. Vera Pavlovna luxuriates. She goes to her 
own room only when her husband isn’t home or when he’s working. 
But no, even when he’s at work she often sits near him in his study. 
When she sees that she’s disturbing him, that his work demands his 
complete attention, then why interfere? But everyone has only a little 
of that kind of work. The larger part of even scholarly research is 
purely mechanical. Therefore, he sees his wife sitting near him about 
three-quarters of the time, and sometimes they even caress each other. 
Only one modification was required: they had to purchase another 
sofa, smaller than her husband’s. That way after dinner Vera Pavlovna 


What Is to Be Done? 245 


can stretch out luxuriously on her own little sofa. Her husband sits 
alongside admiring her. 

“Why are you kissing my hands, my dear? You know I don't like it.” 

“Really? I forgot that it offends you; well then, I'll offend you.” 

“My dear, you have liberated me once again. You have rescued me 
from wicked people, saved me from myself. Caress me, my dear, caress 
me!” 


A month passes. After dinner Vera Pavlovna luxuriates on her soft, 
small, but wide sofa in their room, that is, in her husband's study. He’s 
sitting next to her on the sofa; she embraces him, lays her head on his 
chest, but soon becomes pensive. He kisses her, but her pensiveness 
doesn't pass; tears have welled up in her eyes and are almost ready to 
pour forth. 

“Verochka, my dear, why are you so pensive?” 

Vera Pavlovna weeps, but makes no reply. No. She wipes away her 
tears. 

“No, don’t caress me, my dear. Enough. Thank you!” she says, look- 
ing at him so tenderly and sincerely. “Thank you. Youre so kind to 
me.” 

“Kind, Verochka? What do you mean?” 

“Kind, my dear. You're very kind.” 


Two more days pass. Vera Pavlovna is luxuriating once again after 
dinner. No, she’s not luxuriating; she’s only lying there thinking—in 
her own room on her own bed. Her husband's sitting next to her; he’s 
embracing her and also thinking. 

“No, there’s something wrong. There's something lacking in me,” 
thinks Lopukhov. 

“How kind he is and how ungrateful I am,” thinks Vera Pavlovna. 

That's what they’re both thinking. 

She says, “My dear, go back to yourownroom and do a little work or 
get some rest.” She tries and even manages to say these words in a 
clear, cheerful tone. 

“Why are you chasing me away, Verochka? I feel wonderful here. 

..” and he tries and even manages to say these words in a clear, not 
cheerless tone. 

“No, go on, my dear. You're doing enough for me. Go and get some 
rest.” 

He kisses her. She loses her train of thought; once again she can 
breathe sweetly and easily. 

“Thank you, my dear,” she says. 


246 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Meanwhile Kirsanov was perfectly happy. This time the struggle was 
a bit more difficult; but then again, it afforded him much more inner 
satisfaction. This feeling didn’t pass away as soon as the struggle end- 
ed; it would warm his heart for a long time, to the end of his days. He 
had behaved honorably. Yes. He brought them closer together. Yes, he 
really had. Kirsanov lay on his sofa smoking. He thought, “Be honor- 
able, that is, calculate carefully; make no errors in your calculations. 
Remember that the whole is greater than any of its parts, that is, your 
human nature is stronger and more important to you than each of 
your individual aspirations. Favor its advantage over that of each indi- 
vidual aspiration if you find they're in conflict. That's all there is to it. 
To state it simply: be honorable and everything will turn out very well 
indeed. There's only one rule, and how simple it is; it represents the 
entire result of science, the whole code of laws needed for a happy life. 
Yes, happy are they who are born with the ability to grasp this one 
simple rule. And I'm rather fortunate in this regard. Of course, I'm 
much indebted to my development, more so than to my nature. But 
this will gradually become a general rule inculcated by one’s upbring- 
ing and life circumstances. Then it will be as easy for everyone to live 
on earth as it is now for me. Yes, I’m very satisfied. However, I really 
should drop in on them. I haven't been there in three weeks. It’s high 
time, even though I'll find it unpleasant. I no longer feel drawn there. 
But it’s time. In a few days I'll stop by for half an hour. Or shall I 
postpone it for another month? I think so. Yes, my retreat has been 
accomplished; my maneuvers have been completed. I’ve disappeared 
from sight; now they won't even notice whether I haven’t been there 
for three weeks or three months. It’s very pleasant to reflect from afar 
on people with whom one has behaved so honorably. I shall rest on 
my laurels.” 


Meanwhile, Lopukhov, two or three days later, also after dinner, 
walks into his wife’s room, lifts his Verochka up in his arms, and 
carries her to the ottoman in his own room. “Have a rest here, my 
friend,” he says, enjoying looking at her. She smiles and begins to doze. 
He sits reading. Then she opens her eyes wide and begins to think. 

“How his room is arranged! There’s nothing in it except what’s 
absolutely necessary. No, he has his own whims, too. There's that 
enormous box of cigars I gave him last year. It hasn't been opened yet; 
it’s still waiting its turn. Yes, that’s his only whim: cigars are his one 
extravagance.!47 No, here’s another one: a photograph of that old man. 


147. Lopukhov continues the line of cigar-smoking radicals in Russian fiction. His 
predecessors include Beltov in Herzen’s novel Who Is to Blame? and Bazarov in Fathers 
and Sons (1862), by the politically moderate Ivan Turgenev (1818-1883) (on both, see

What a noble face, what a combination of benevolence and perspicaci- 
ty in his eyes, in his entire expression! Dmitry went to a great deal of 
trouble to get it, for no one has any photographs of Robert Owen 
anywhere.!48 He wrote him three letters. Two of the messengers never 
found the old man; the third found him and plagued him until a really 
excellent photograph could be taken. How happy Dmitry was when he 
received it along with a letter from that ‘holy old man,’ as Dmitry used 
to call him. It was a letter in which Owen even had some praise for me, 
based on Dmitry’s words.!*9 And here's yet another extravagance: my 
portrait. For half a year he saved up enough money to commission a 
good artist; how he and that young painter pestered me. Only two 
portraits, and nothing else. Would it really be all that expensive to buy 
some engravings and photographs as I've done in my room? And he 
has no fresh flowers, while I have so many. Why doesn’t he need them, 
while I do? Is it really only because I'm a woman? What nonsense! Or 
is it because he’s such a serious, scholarly person? But Kirsanov has 
engravings and cut flowers in his room, and he’s also a serious, schol- 
arly person. 

“And why does it bore him to spend so much time with me? I know 
that it costs him a great deal of effort. Is it really because he’s such a 
serious, scholarly person? But Kirsanov is . . . No, no, Dmitry's a good, 
kind man. He’s done everything for me; he’s ready and willing to do 
anything for me. Who could possibly love me the way he does? And I 
do love him; I'm ready to do anything for him. . . .” 

“Verochka, you're not asleep, my dear friend?” 

“Dearest, why don’t you have any fresh flowers in your room?” 

“If you'd like, my dear, I'll get some. First thing tomorrow. It simply 
hadn't occurred to me that it would be a good idea. But now I see that 
it would.” 

‘I'd also like to suggest one other thing: buy yourself some photo- 
graphs. Even better, I'll use some of my own money to buy you some 
flowers and photographs.” 

“Then I'd certainly enjoy them. I'd have liked them anyway, but if 
you buy them they'll provide even greater pleasure. But Verochka, why 


Introduction, pp. 25-27). In What Is to Be Done? Chernyshevsky sought in part to refute 
the critical depictions of the “new people” in Turgenev's work. While Beltov's cigar 
represents an old aristocratic habit and Bazarov’s a defilement of nature meant to offend 
the liberal Kirsanovs, Rakhmetov's cigar humanizes Chernyshevsky's extraordinary man. 

148. Believing that environment shaped individual character, the British utopian so- 
cialist and reformer Robert Owen (1771-1858) founded several self-sufficient communi- 
ties based on the principle of cooperative labor in an attempt to foster social harmony, 
justice, and general well-being. 

149. Chernyshevsky uses this reference to Vera Pavlovna’s sewing cooperative to link 
his own ideas on social and economic reform with Owen's. 


248 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


were you so pensive just now? You've been thinking about your 
dream. Will you let me ask you to tell me more about that dream that 
frightened you so?” 

“My dear, I really wasn't thinking about it just now. It’s very painful 
for me to recall it.” 

“But, Verochka, perhaps it would be good for me to know more 
about it.” 

“If you like, my dear. I dreamed that I was annoyed because I 
couldn't go to the opera. I was thinking about Bosio. Then some wom- 
an appeared to me whom I took to be Bosio at first, but she kept hiding 
from me. She made me read my own diary. It said there only how 
much we loved each other, but when she touched a page with her 
hand, new words appeared saying that I didn’t love you.” 

“Forgive me, my friend, for asking you another question. Was it really 
only a dream?” 

“My dear, if it had been otherwise, wouldn't I have told you? I 
informed you about my dream right away.” 

This was said so tenderly, so sincerely, so simply that Lopukhov 
experienced a feeling of warmth and sweetness in his heart, a feeling 
of the kind that one fortunate enough to experience it never forgets for 
the rest of his life. Oh, what a pity that so few men ever come to know 
this feeling! Compared to it all the joys of happy love are insignificant. 
This feeling always fills a man’s heart with the purest contentment, the 
most sacred pride. These words that Vera Pavlovna uttered with some 
sadness contained a reproach, but its meaning was “Dear friend, don't 
you know that you've earned my complete trust? A wife is supposed to 
conceal from her husband the secret stirrings of her heart: such are 
the established relations between them. But, my dear, you've behaved 
in such a way that there's no need for me to hide anything. My heart is 
as open to you as it is to me.” 

This is a husband's great merit. This reward is earned only by high 
moral worth. One who's earned it can properly consider himself to be 
a man of irreproachable nobility. He can boldly hope that his con- 
science is clean and will always remain so; that his fortitude will never 
fail him; that whatever trials and tribulations befall him, he'll remain 
serene and steadfast; that fate has almost no control over the world of 
his soul; that from the time he’s earned this great honor to the end of 
his life, whatever blows are inflicted, he'll be content in the awareness 
of his own human dignity. We now know Lopukhov well enough to see 
that he wasn't a sentimental person; however, he was so touched by 
his wife’s words that his face became quite flushed. 

“Verochka, my dear, you've reproached me.” His voice shook for the 
second and last time in his life. The first time was a result of the doubt 


What Is to Be Done? 249 


surrounding his hypothesis; now it was shaking from joy. “You’ve 
reproached me, Vera, but this reproach is dearer to me than all your 
words of love. I've offended you by my nasty question, but I’m so 
happy that it occasioned such a reproach. Look, there are tears in my 
eyes. This is the first time in my life since childhood that I've cried.” 

He didn’t take his eyes off Vera for the whole evening; it never once 
occurred to her that he was making any effort to be tender. That 
evening was one of the happiest of her life, at least up to that point. 
Several years after these events that I’m now relating to you, she'll have 
many more happy days, months, and years. It will be when her chil- 
dren have grown and she'll regard them as people who are happy, and 
deservedly so. This joy is greater than all others; what in every other 
personal joy is but a rare, transitory intensity, will be for her the 
ordinary level of everyday happiness. But this still lies in the future for 
her. 


Xxi. 


But after his wife fell asleep on his lap, and after he placed her on 
her own little sofa, Lopukhov began to ruminate in earnest about her 
dream. The important point for him was not whether she loved him; 
that was her own business and she had no control over it, nor, as he 
could plainly see, did he. That would resolve itself: there was no point 
in thinking about it except at one’s leisure. But there was no time for 
that now; he had to figure out what had caused the premonition that 
she didn't love him. 

This was not the first time he sat plunged in thought. During the last 
several days he’d realized that he would be unable to retain her love. It 
was a painful loss, but what was to be done? If he could have altered 
his own nature and acquired that propensity for quiet tenderness 
which her nature demanded, oh, then, of course, it would be a differ- 
ent story. But he realized that even the attempt would be in vain. If 
such an inclination is neither endowed by nature nor instilled by life 
experience independent of a person’s intentions, no one can create it 
in himself through force of will. Without this propensity, nothing can 
be done as it ought to be. Consequently, the question was resolved. 
Previous reflections had been wasted on this matter. But now, having 
dispensed with his own point of view (as an egoist he always thought 
of himself first, and about others only when there was nothing left of 
his own to think about), he could apply himself to someone else’s 
point of view, namely, hers. What could he do for her? She still didn’t 
understand what was happening; her heart had not experienced life 


250 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


as much as he had. Why, that was only natural. She was four years 
younger than he; at the beginning of young adulthood, four years 
make quite a difference. Couldn't he, the more experienced one, grasp 
what she couldn't? How could he decipher her dream? 

Soon Lopukhov arrived at a hypothesis: the cause of her ominous 
thoughts must be found in the circumstances that produced her 
dream. Its motivation must have some connection to its content.5° 
She says she was annoyed because she couldn't go to the opera. 
Lopukhov began to examine their way of life; gradually it all became 
very Clear. She used to spend the major part of her free time alone, just 
as he did. Then a change took place: she was constantly being enter- 
tained. Now once more their previous mode was returning. She 
couldn’t accept this resumption with indifference: it wasn’t in her 
nature, nor was it for the large majority of people. There was nothing 
mysterious about it! From here it was a very short step to the supposi- 
tion that the key to understanding the whole situation was her close 
relationship with Kirsanov followed by his estrangement. Why did 
Kirsanov withdraw? The reason was self-evident: a lack of time, a great 
deal of work. But it was impossible to deceive an honest and intelligent 
man, one experienced in life, particularly one who advocated the theo- 
ries Lopukhov did, by any tricks or ruses. He could, however, fool 
himself as a result of inattention, by failing to pay sufficient attention 
to some fact or other. Indeed, Lopukhov had made just that kind of 
mistake when Kirsanov had withdrawn the first time. To tell the truth, 
he’d seen no reason and therefore felt no desire to conduct a thorough 
investigation of the motives for his withdrawal. He’d only been inter- 
ested in discovering whether he was responsible for the breach in 
their friendship. It was clear that he wasn't, so there was nothing more 
to think about. Why, he was neither Kirsanov’s tutor nor his mentor, 
obliged to direct his pupil’s steps onto the path of righteousness, 
when the other person understood these things just as well as he did. 
And, in fact, what need was there to do so? Was there really something 
particularly significant for him in his relations with Kirsanov? When 
you're a good fellow and want me to like you, then it’s very pleasant; if 
not, then I’m sorry, but be on your way—it's all the same to me. It 
makes very little difference whether there’s one fool more or less on 
this earth. I mistook a fool for a good person; I regret it, but that’s that. 
If our own interests aren’t connected to a man’s actions, then his 
actions will interest us but little if we are serious people, with the 


150. On the one hand Chernyshevsky draws on the biblical tradition of revelation, and 
on the other hand he anticipates Freud's theories by using dreams and their interpreta- 
tion as the principal medium through which Vera liberates herself. 


What Is to Be Done? 251 


exception of two instances. However, these two seem to be exceptions 
to the rule only for those people accustomed to defining the word 
“interest” in too narrow a sense of ordinary reckoning. The first in- 
stance is if these actions hold any interest for us from a theoretical 
perspective, as psychological phenomena explaining the nature of a 
particular individual; that is, if we have any intellectual interest in 
them. The second instance is if the fate of a person depends on us and 
we would experience guilt for lack of attention to his actions; that is, if 
we have any moral interest in them. But there was nothing whatever in 
the foolish tricks Kirsanov had played at the time that Lopukhov 
would not have considered to be the most ordinary manifestations of 
contemporary conventions. Nor was there anything unusual about a 
man who had decent convictions yielding to vulgarity engendered by 
those conventions. Lopukhov couldn't possibly conceive that he might 
play an important part in Kirsanov’s fate. Why on earth would Kir- 
sanov require his solicitude? Consequently, be on your way, my friend, 
go wherever you like. I've no need to think any further about you. 

But it's not like that now. Kirsanov's actions appear to have an 
important bearing on the interests of the woman he loves. He can't 
help thinking about them very carefully. But to think about a fact 
carefully and to grasp its cause are almost one and the same for a 
person with Lopukhov's cast of mind. Lopukhov found that his theory 
provided an infallible means for analyzing the movements of the hu- 
man heart; I must confess that I agree with him entirely on this point. 
During the long years that I've relied upon this theory as true, it’s 
never led me astray and never once refused to reveal the truth to me, 
however deeply this truth was concealed by some human action. The 
truth is that this theory itself is not so easily embraced. One has to 
have lived and thought in order to be able to grasp it. 

After only about half an hour of reflection Lopukhov understood 
Kirsanov's relations with Vera Pavlovna completely. But for a long time 
he sat there thinking about it. There was no reason to explain it any 
further, but it was interesting nonetheless. His discovery was complete 
in every detail, but it was so intriguing that he was unable to fall asleep 
for a very long while. 

However, was it really worth straining his nerves with insomnia? 
Why, it was already three o'clock in the morning. If he couldn't get to 
sleep, he’d take some morphine. He took two pills; then he wanted “to 
go and have a look at Verochka.” But instead of going and looking, he 
moved his armchair over to her sofa, sat down, took her hand, and 
kissed it. “My dearest,” she mumbled halfasleep, “you've been working 
too hard, and all for me. How kind you are and how much I love you.” 

No spiritual travail can withstand a sufficient dose of morphine. 


252 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


This time two pills proved to be enough; he was becoming drowsy. 
Consequently, the spiritual travail was roughly equivalent in strength 
(according to Lopukhov’s materialist viewpoint) to four cups of strong 
coffee. One pill would have been too little, and three would have been 
too much. He fell asleep, still chuckling over this comparison. 


xxii. A Theoretical Conversation 


The next day, upon his return from the hospital, Kirsanov was just 
about to lie down like a sybarite to read and smoke a cigar after his late 
dinner when in walked Lopukhov. 

“An uninvited guest is worse than any Tatar,”!5! said Lopukhov in a 
jovial voice, but his tone was not really all that jovial. “I’m disturbing 
you, Alexander, but it can’t be helped. I have to do it. I want to have a 
serious talk with you. I wanted to come over sooner, but I overslept 
this morning and then I wouldn't have found you in.” Lopukhov was 
speaking in earnest. 

“What does this mean? Has he really guessed?” wondered Kirsanov. 

“Let’s have a talk,” continued Lopukhov, taking a seat. “Look me 
straight in the eye.” 

“Yes,” thought Kirsanov, “there’s no doubt about it. He’s going to talk 
about it.” 

“Listen, Dmitry,” said Kirsanov in an even more serious tone of 
voice. “You and I are friends, but there are some things that even 
friends can’t allow each other to do. I ask you to cut this conversation 
short. Right now I’m not much inclined toward serious talk. I never 
am.” Kirsanov's eyes glared with hostility as if before him stood a man 
who he suspected was about to commit a crime. 

“It’s impossible not to speak about it, Alexander,” continued Lopu- 
khov in a calm but slightly hollow voice. “I’ve now come to an under- 
standing of your maneuvers.” 

“Silence! I forbid you to speak unless you want me to be your eternal 
enemy or wish to lose my respect.” 

“Some time ago you weren't afraid of losing my respect, remember? 
Now it’s all clear. I didn’t pay any attention then.” 

“Dmitry, I beg you to leave, or else J shall.” 


151. A Turkic-speaking people, originally nomads of eastern Central Asia, the Tatars 
participated in the Mongol invasion and occupation of the eastern Slavic lands from the 
mid-thirteenth to the fifteenth century. In Russian usage, “Tatar” and “Mongol” become 
virtually synonymous and frequently appeared as a kind of popular racist epithet, as 
here. 


What Is to Be Done? 253 


“You can't leave. Do you suppose I’m concerned with your inter- 
ests?” 

Kirsanov remained silent. 

“My position is advantageous. Yours in conversation with me is not. 
I appear to be a man performing a great and noble deed. But that’s 
nonsense. I must behave according to common sense. Alexander, I ask 
you to stop all these maneuvers. They will get you nowhere.” 

“What? Is it really too late? Forgive me,” replied Kirsanov quickly. He 
couldn't decide whether it was a feeling of joy or sorrow that Lopu- 
khov’s last words provoked. 

“No, you haven't understood me correctly. It isn’t too late. Nothing 
has happened so far. We'll have to see what comes next. However, I 
don't really understand what youre talking about, Alexander, just as 
you don't really know what I’m talking about. We really don’t under- 
stand each other, right? We have no real need to understand each 
other, right? These riddles that you don’t understand must be very 
unpleasant. Well, there aren’t any. I haven't said a thing. I have nothing 
to say to you. Give me a cigar. Absent-mindedly I forgot to bring my 
own along. I'll have a smoke and then we'll discuss some learned 
questions. That’s really why I came over. I had nothing better to do 
and wanted to engage in some learned discussion. What do you think 
about these strange experiments to produce artificial albumin?”152 
Lopukhov moved another armchair up close so that he could stretch 
out his legs; he got himself comfortable, lit up his cigar, and continued 
his speech. “In my opinion it’s a great discovery if the results can be 
shown to be correct. Have you repeated the experiments?” 

“No, but I must try.” 

“You're fortunate to have a good laboratory at your disposal. Please 
try to repeat the experiments, and be as careful as possible. Why, it 
could mean a complete revolution in regard to the question of food, as 
well as the whole life of mankind! The manufacture of a fundamental 
nutritive substance directly from inorganic matter! That’s extraordi- 
nary, worthy of Newton’s discovery!!53 Don’t you agree?” 

“Of course, but I have serious reservations about the accuracy of the 
experiments. Sooner or later we'll get there, no doubt about it. It’s clear 
that science is heading in that direction. But we haven't got there yet.” 


152. From the late eighteenth until the early twentieth century, European scientists 
tried persistently to synthesize albumin, a form of protein used extensively in textile 
printing, food processing, and other processes. Nineteenth-century radicals believed 
that its successful synthesis would improve the lot of the poor by both increasing the 
supply of food and reducing its cost.

254 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Is that what you think? So do I. That means our conversation is at 
an end. Good-bye, Alexander. In taking my leave, I request that you 
resume your frequent visits to us, as before. Good-bye.” 

Kirsanov's eyes, which had been glaring with hostility at Lopukhov 
all the while, now blazed into indignation. 

“Apparently, Dmitry, you still wish me to believe that you have base 
thoughts.” 

“On the contrary. But you must visit us. There’s nothing strange 
about that! Why, you and I are friends. What's odd about my request?” 

“I cannot. You’re embarking on a reckless undertaking, therefore 
one that’s despicable.” 

“I don’t understand what task you're referring to; I must say that I 
don’t like this conversation any more than you did two minutes ago.” 

“I demand an explanation, Dmitry.” 

“There’s no need. There's absolutely nothing to explain and nothing 
to understand. You're getting excited over nothing.” 

“No, I can’t let you get away,” Kirsanov said, taking Lopukhov by the 
arm as he started to leave. “Sit down. You began talking when it wasn’t 
necessary. You demand God-knows-what from me. Now you must 
hear me out.” 

Lopukhov sat down. 

“What right do you have?” Kirsanov spoke with even greater indig- 
nation than before. “What right do you have to demand of me some- 
thing that’s so painful? Why am I obligated to you? What for? It’s 
absurd. Try to get rid of this romantic nonsense! Behavior that you and 
I consider normal will really only come into being when society’s 
concepts and conventions have changed. Society must be reeducated; 
it’s being done through the development of life. A person who’s been 
reeducated will certainly help others. But until society's been reedu- 
cated, completely reorganized, you do not have the right to place 
another's fate at risk. Don’t you see what a terrible thing this is, or have 
you taken leave of your senses?” 

“No, I don't understand a thing, Alexander. I don’t know what you're 
talking about. You tend to read some astonishing hidden meaning into 
your friend’s simple request that you stop neglecting him because he 
enjoys your company. I don’t understand why youre getting so agi- 
tated.” 

“No, Dmitry, you won't wriggle out of this conversation by making a 
joke. I must prove to you that you're insane for having conceived of 
such a base idea. There are quite a few things that you and I don’t 
admit, aren't there? We don't admit that a slap in the face in and of 
itself dishonors a person; that’s both a stupid and harmful prejudice, 
nothing more. But then, do you have the right to subject a man to such 


What Is to Be Done? 255 


a slap in the face? Why, that would constitute a base criminal act on 
your part and would deprive a person of his peace of mind. Do you 
understand, you fool? Do you understand that if I love another person, 
and you demand that I give him a slap in the face (which, according to 
both you and me, is pure nonsense, rubbish), do you understand that 
if you demand this, I'll consider you to be a fool and a base man? If you 
force me to do it, I'll kill either you or myself, depending on whose life 
is more expendable. I'll kill you or myself, rather than do what you 
demand. Do you understand that, you fool? I’m talking about a man 
and about a slap in the face, which, although an absurdity, can still 
deprive a man of his peace of mind. Besides men, there are also wom- 
en on this earth, and they are also people. Besides a slap in the face, 
there are other kinds of nonsense, which we rightly believe to be 
nonsense, but which also deprive people of their peace of mind. Do 
you understand that if you subject another person (even a woman) to 
some form of what we rightly believe to be nonsense (it doesn’t matter 
what form), do you understand that such an act is disgusting, vile, and 
dishonorable? Do you hear me? I'm saying that your scheme is dis- 
honorable.” 

“My friend, you are absolutely right about what's honorable and 
dishonorable. But I don’t know why you're saying all this and I don't 
understand what bearing it has on me. I haven't said one thing to you 
about any intention to jeopardize anyone's peace of mind, nothing of 
the kind. You're imagining it all, nothing more. I'm simply asking you 
as my friend not to neglect me, because as your friend I enjoy spend- 
ing time with you. That's all there is to it. Will you comply with your 
friend’s request?” 

“It's dishonorable, as I've told you. I won't do anything that’s dis- 
honorable.” 

“That's certainly very commendable. But youre all upset because of 
some figment of your imagination and now you've plunged into theo- 
ry. Obviously you want to theorize to no purpose, with no application 
to reality. Well, then, I will also begin to do so, equally in vain, and I'll 
pose a question to you which bears no relation to anything, except to 
clarify an abstract truth, with no applications whatsoever. If someone 
can give pleasure to another person without causing himself any dis- 
comfort, then in my opinion calculation demands that he do so, be- 
cause he himself would receive some pleasure from it as well. Isn't 
that so?” 

“That's rubbish, Dmitry. What you say is all wrong.” 

“I'm not saying anything, Alexander. I’m merely engaging in the- 
oretical speculation. Here’s another question. If some need is aroused 
in a person, can our attempt to stifle that need ever lead to anything 


256 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


good? What's your opinion? Isn't it rather that such an attempt can 
never lead to anything good? It merely results in a situation where the 
need increases enormously. And this is unhealthy; or it turns in a false 
direction—and that’s both harmful and vile; or, in being stifled, it 
stifles life as well. And that’s a great shame.” 

“That's not the point, Dmitry. I'll pose this theoretical question in 
another form. Does anyone have the right to subject another person to 
any risk, when that person’s life is just fine without risk? You and I 
know that there'll come a time when all the needs of every man’s 
nature will be entirely satisfied; but we also know full well that that 
time has not yet come. For the present a reasonable person is content 
if he can live comfortably, even if not all the sides of his nature are 
nurtured by that very situation in which he so comfortably lives. Let's 
suppose, as an abstract hypothesis, that such a reasonable person 
exists. Let’s suppose that this person is a woman. Further, again as an 
abstract hypothesis, let's suppose that the comfortable situation in 
which she lives is called marriage, and that this person is content with 
her situation. Now, I ask, given these conditions and this abstract 
hypothesis, who has the right to subject this person to the risk of 
losing something good (with which she is content), just to see whether 
this person might be able to acquire something better (which she 
could easily do without)? The Golden Age will dawn, Dmitry, we know 
that, but it still lies ahead. The Iron Age is passing, it has almost 
passed; but the Golden Age has not yet arrived.154 If, according to my 
abstract hypothesis, some strong need of this person (let's assume, 
only for the sake of an example, the need for love) were completely 
unsatisfied, or were ill satisfied, then I would say nothing against such 
a person’s incurring a risk herself, but only that particular kind of risk, 
and certainly not any other risk, inflicted on that person by someone 
else. But if that person does find a sufficient satisfaction of that need, 
then she shouldn't subject herself to any risk. Let’s suppose, in the 
abstract, that she doesn’t wish to incur any risk. I say that she’s right 
and sensible in not wishing to incur any; further, I say that anyone 
who subjects such a person to risk is acting in a stupid and senseless 
way. What can you possibly say to refute this hypothetical conclusion? 
Nothing! Understand, then, that you have no right.” 

“If I were in your place, Alexander, I would have said exactly the 
same as you did. I, too, am merely supposing that you have some 
personal interest in this question. I know that it really doesn’t concern 


154. By referring to the transformation of the prerevolutionary “Iron Age” into a post- 
revolutionary utopian “Golden Age” in almost alchemical terms, Chernyshevsky is allud- 
ing to the transformation of society through technological change as well as through 
socia] revolution. 


What Is to Be Done? 257 


either of us and that we're speaking merely as scholars about some of 
the more intriguing aspects of our general scientific views that seem 
valid to us. According to these views, each person evaluates every issue 
from his own point of view defined by his personal relationship to the 
matter. And only in this respect am I saying that if I were in your place, 
I would have said exactly the same as you did. And in my place, you 
would say the same as I. From a general scientific point of view, this is 
an undisputable truth. A in B’s place is B; if, in B’s place, A were not B, 
that would mean that A was not exactly in B’s place. A would have 
failed to get there—isn’'t that right? Consequently, you can’t object to 
this, nor can I to your words. But, following your model, I shall con- 
struct a hypothesis that is similarly abstract and has no application to 
anything whatsoever. First, let's suppose that there exist three individ- 
uals—an assumption that contains in and of itself nothing impossible. 
Then let’s suppose that one of them has a secret that he wishes to 
conceal from a second, and especially from a third; let’s suppose that 
the second guesses the secret and says to the first, ‘Do what I ask you 
or I'll reveal your secret to the third.’ What do you think about this 
case?” 

Kirsanov went a bit pale and twirled his mustache at length. 

“Dmitry,” he said at last, “you're treating me very badly.” 

“And why the devil should I treat you well? What do I care about 
you, pray tell? Besides, I don’t understand what you’re talking about. 
Were speaking as scholars; we're posing various abstract problems to 
each other. I finally managed to pose one that made you stop and 
think; now my scholarly pride is satisfied. Therefore, I shall conclude 
this theoretical discussion. J have a great deal of work, no less than you 
have. And so, farewell. By the way, I almost forgot. Alexander, you will 
honor my request to visit us, your good friends who are always so glad 
to see you, won't you? You'll come as often as you did in previous 
months?” 

Lopukhov rose. 

Kirsanov sat there examining his fingers as if each one stood for an 
abstract hypothesis. 

“You're treating me very badly, Dmitry. I have no choice but to honor 
your request. However, I shall impose one condition on you in return. 
I'll visit you; but if I ever leave your house to go somewhere not unac- 
companied, you must go with us everywhere. I don’t want to have to 
invite you, do you hear? You must come with us even without my 
asking. Without you, I shall go nowhere—neither to the opera nor to 
see acquaintances—not one step.” 

“Don't you think I will find this condition offensive, Alexander? What 
are you, a thief in my eyes, or what?” 


258 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“That’s not what I mean. I wouldn't offend you by suggesting that 
you regard me as a thief. I’d place my life in your hands without 
hesitation. I'd hope that I have the right to expect the same of you. It’s 
for me to understand what I mean. You must just do as I ask; that's 
that.” 

“Now I understand as well. Yes, you've already done a great deal in 
this regard. Now you want to go to even more trouble. Well, in this 
case, you're right. Yes, you must force me. But, as grateful as I am to 
you, my friend, nothing will come of it. I've tried to force myself. I have 
willpower, just as you do, and I too have conducted maneuvers, no 
less than you. But those things that are achieved through calculation, 
through a feeling of obligation, through an effort of the will, and not 
through the attraction of nature, emerge stillborn. You can only de- 
stroy something that way, just as you've been destroying yourself; you 
can't give life.” Lopukhov was deeply moved by Kirsanov's words, es- 
pecially when he said, “It’s for me to understand what I mean.” “Thank 
you, my friend. Why have we never embraced each other before? Per- 
haps you'd like us to do so now?” 


If Lopukhov as a theorist had examined his actions during this 
conversation, he would have remarked with pleasure, “How true the 
theory is: egoism plays with man. I concealed the most important 
thing. ‘Let's suppose,’ he said, ‘that this person is content with his or 
her situation.’ That’s just where I should have said, ‘Alexander, your 
assumption is wrong.’ But I was silent because it wasn't to my advan- 
tage to speak. It's pleasant to observe as a theorist the tricks that 
egoism plays in practice. You retreat from the battle because it’s a lost 
cause, but your egoism twists your gestures so that you act the role of 
a man performing noble deeds.” 

If Kirsanov as a theorist had examined his actions during this con- 
versation, he would have remarked with pleasure, “How true the theo- 
ry is: I wanted to preserve my peace of mind and rest on my laurels, 
but I wound up saying, ‘You have no right to risk a woman's peace of 
mind. And this means (you will understand) that I really was perform- 
ing noble deeds to my own detriment, for a certain person's peace of 
mind and for yours, my friend. Therefore you must bow before the 
magnanimity of my soul.’ It's pleasant to observe as a theorist the 
tricks that egoism plays in practice. I retreated from the battle so as 
not to play a fool and scoundrel; I rejoiced as if I'd performed heroic 
deeds of generous nobility. You refuse to yield at the first word of an 
invitation so as not to have to worry about yourself again, and so as not 
to be deprived of that sweet rejoicing over your own nobility. But 


What Is to Be Done? 259 


egoism twists your gestures so that you act the role of a man persisting 
in noble endeavors.” 

But neither Lopukhov nor Kirsanov had the opportunity to become 
a theoretician and to make these pleasant observations. The practical 
aspects of this matter weighed on both of them rather heavily. 


xxiii. 


The renewal of Kirsanov's frequent visits was explained very natu- 
rally. Having been so distracted and having neglected his work for five 
months or so, he'd had to spend about a month and a half catching up 
without any letup. Now that he’d managed to catch up with his ne- 
glected work, he could appropriate his time more freely. This fact was 
so clear that it needed almost no explanation. 

It was really all so obvious and splendid that it aroused no suspi- 
cions in Vera Paviovna’s mind. Meanwhile, Kirsanov played his part 
with the same irreproachable artistry as before. He was afraid that 
when he first arrived at the Lopukhovs' after the learned conversation 
with his friend, he’d make a fool of himself. He'd either blush from 
excitement when he saw Vera Pavlovna for the first time or he’d too 
obviously avoid looking at her at all, or something of the kind. But no, 
he was satisfied with himself, and rightfully so, at the moment he met 
her again. He displayed the pleasant, friendly smile of a man glad to 
return to old friends from whom he'd been separated for some time, a 
calm demeanor, and the lively and carefree conversation of a man who 
had nothing on his mind except those thoughts that he uttered freely. 
Had you been the most vicious gossip and scrutinized him with the 
most eager desire to find something inappropriate, you still wouldn't 
have seen him as anything but a man who was very glad that he had 
the time available and who was able to spend a pleasant evening 
enjoying the company of his good friends. 

If the first moments were carried off so well, what would prevent 
him from bearing up for the rest of the evening? And if he could carry 
off the first evening, would it be difficult to continue on following 
evenings? There wasn't one single word that wasn’t free and easy, not 
a single glance that wasn’t clear and simple, direct and friendly. And 
that's all there was to it. 

But while Kirsanov was behaving himself no worse than before, the 
eyes that were looking at him were inclined to notice much more than 
any other eyes could possibly have seen. Yes, no other eyes would 
have noticed. Lopukhov himself, whom Marya Aleksevna earlier ac- 


260 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


knowledged to be a born tax farmer,!5>5 was surprised at his friend’s 
self-possession, which didn’t betray Kirsanov even for a single mo- 
ment. As a theorist he derived great pleasure from these observations; 
almost against his will he found the psychological significance of this 
phenonemon very interesting from the scientific point of view. How- 
ever, Vera's dream visitor had neither sung her song nor forced Vera to 
read that diary in vain. One’s eyes become all too keen when this 
visitor whispers in one’s ear. 

Even those eyes could find nothing, but the dream visitor whis- 
pered, “Isn't it possible to see something, even though there’s really 
nothing here, as I myself know; nevertheless, let's try to take a good 
look.” The eyes began to look, and although they really didn’t see 
anything, the mere fact that they were looking was quite enough for 
them to notice that something was not quite right. 

For example, Vera Pavlovna, her husband, and Kirsanov are just 
setting off for an ordinary little evening gathering at the Mertsalovs’. 
Why isn’t Kirsanov waltzing at this informal little party, when even 
Lopukhov is? The general rule is: “Even if you’re a seventy-year old 
man and have wound up here, you must make a fool of yourself just 
like everyone else. Here no one looks at anyone. Everyone shares one 
and the same idea: the more noise and movement, the more enjoy- 
ment for each and every person.” So why isn’t Kirsanov waltzing? Now 
he’s started to, but why did he wait so long before beginning? Was it 
really worth spending that much time debating whether he would or 
wouldn't take such an important step? If he hadn’t started to waltz, 
then his secret would have been half revealed. If he had, but not with 
Vera Pavlovna, then his secret would have been entirely revealed all at 
once. But he was too skillful an actor playing his role. He didn’t want 
to dance with Vera Pavlovna, yet he realized at once that it would be 
noticed. Therefore, as a result of his brief hesitation, which had no 
visible relation to Vera Pavlovna or to anyone else on earth, there 
remained in her memory only a small, very slight question that, in and 
of itself would have gone unnoticed even by her, despite the whisper- 
ings of her dream visitor, if that very same visitor hadn't been whisper- 
ing a large number of just such small, insignificant questions into her 
ear. 

For instance, when they were returning from the Mertsalovs’ and 
making arrangements to hear the opera The Puritans!56 the next day, 
and Vera Pavlovna said to her husband, “My dear, you really don’t like 
this opera. You'll be bored. I'l] go with Alexander Matveich. He enjoys 


155. See n. 72 above. 
156. [ Puritani (1835), an opera by the noted Italian composer Vincenzo Bellini (1801— 
1835), was first performed in St. Petersburg in 1840. 


What Is to Be Done? 261 


every opera. If you or I wrote one, I think he’d listen to that, too,” why 
didn’t Kirsanov support Vera Pavlovna’s opinion? Why didn't he say, 
“Really, Dmitry, I won’t get you a ticket”? Why was that? Of course, the 
fact that her “dearest” wanted to go along anyway didn’t raise any 
questions. He’s been escorting his wife everywhere since the time she 
asked him to spend more time with her. He hasn't forgotten that; 
therefore it was perfectly natural that he'd want to go along. That only 
confirmed the fact that he was a kind man and she really ought to love 
him. That’s true enough, but Kirsanov didn’t know that. So why didn’t 
he support Vera Pavlovna’s opinion? Of course, these are mere trifles, 
almost unnoticable; Vera Pavlovna almost forgot all about it, but these 
unnoticed grains of sand kept falling onto one side of the scales, even 
though they went unnoticed. But here, for example, is a conversation 
that was more like a large pellet than a small grain of sand. 

The next day when they were going to the opera in a hired carriage 
(for it was cheaper than going in two cabs), their conversation touched 
on, among other subjects, the Mertsalovs, at whose apartment they’d 
spent the previous evening. They praised their harmonious life, obser- 
ving that it was a rarity. Everyone agreed, including Kirsanov, who 
said, “Yes, and another good point about Mertsalov is that his wife can 
bare her soul to him freely.” Kirsanov was the one who said it; each of 
them thought about saying the same thing, but it fell to Kirsanov to 
utter it. Why did he? What did it mean? If you took it in one way, it 
would sound like a compliment for Lopukhov and a tribute to Vera 
Pavlovna’s happiness with him. Of course, it could also have been said 
without a thought for anyone except the Mertsalovs. But if one as- 
sumes that Kirsanov was thinking about both the Mertsalovs and the 
Lopukhovs, it means that it was being said for Vera Pavlovna’s benefit. 
But to what end? 

Isn't that always the way it is: if a person’s inclined to look for 
something, he finds it wherever he looks. Even if there’s no trace of it at 
all, he still finds clear evidence. Even if there’s not even a shadow, still 
he sees not only a shadow of what he’s looking for but everything he’s 
looking for. He sees it in the most unmistakable terms, and these terms 
become clearer with each new glance and every new thought. 

Here, in addition, there really was a very tangible fact concealing 
within itself the solution to the entire matter. It was clear that Kirsanov 
respected the Lopukhovs. Why had he made himself scarce for more 
than two years? It was obvious that he was a completely honorable 
man. How was it, then, that he’d posed as such a vulgar person? As 
long as Vera Pavlovna didn’t have to think about these things, she 
hadn't thought about them, just as Lopukhov hadn’t. But now she 
tended to think about them. 


262 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 
xxiv. 


Slowly and imperceptibly this discovery dawned upon her. Steadily 
there accumulated all sorts of small, almost insignificant impressions 
of Kirsanov’s words and actions to which no one else would have paid 
any attention; she herself could scarcely notice them, for most were 
merely supposed or intimated. Gradually she became more and more 
intrigued by one question: Why had he avoided her for almost three 
years? An idea was slowly taking shape: “Such a man could not possi- 
bly have withdrawn merely as a result of petty vanity, which he lacks 
completely.” Yet behind all these inexplicable reflections there arose 
into her consciousness even more slowly and more obscurely from the 
deepest recesses of her being the question “Why am I even thinking 
about him? What is he to me?” 

One day after dinner Vera Pavlovna was sitting alone in her room 
sewing and thinking; she was reflecting very calmly, not about him, 
but about this and that, the household, the workshop, and her lessons. 
Gradually, very gradually her thoughts turned to the subject that for 
some reason or other had been occupying her more and more of late. 
Recollections surfaced, and then insignificant questions; they grew 
and multiplied; then thousands of them swarmed in her mind, grow- 
ing larger and larger, all merging into a single question whose form 
was becoming clearer and clearer: “What is happening to me? What 
am I thinking about? What am I feeling?” Vera Pavlovna’s fingers ne- 
glected their sewing; her work slipped from her downcast hands. She 
turned a little pale and then blushed; she became even paler and then 
her cheeks became bright red. A moment later, with cheeks as white as 
snow and eyes wild, she ran into her husband's room, threw herself 
on his knees, embraced him convulsively, laid her head on his shoul- 
der so that it would both support her and hide her face, and with a 
choking voice she uttered, “My darling, I love him.” Then she burst 
into tears. 

“So what, my dear? Why should that upset you?” 

“IT don’t want to hurt you, my dear. I want to love you.” 

“Try, dear, wait and see. If you can, then fine. Calm down. Give 
yourself some time, and you'll see what you can and can't do. You're 
so fond of me. How could you hurt me?” 

He stroked her hair, kissed her head, and squeezed her hand. Fora 
long time she was unable to stop her convulsive weeping, but gradu- 
ally she calmed down. He'd been awaiting this confession for some 
time; consequently he was able to receive it with equanimity, but then 
again she was unable to see his face. 


What Is to Be Done? 263 


“I don’t want to see him. I'll tell him he must stop visiting us,” Vera 
Pavlovna said. 

“As you see fit, my friend. Do what's best for you. When you've 
calmed down, we can talk about it. No matter what happens between 
us, you and I can't help but be friends. Give me your hand. Squeeze 
mine. There, see how warmly you did that?” Each of these phrases was 
uttered after a long pause during which he stroked her hair and ca- 
ressed her as a brother does his grieving sister. “Do you remember, my 
friend, what you said to me when we became engaged? ‘You're setting 
me free.” There was another long silence and more caresses. “Do you 
remember when we talked for the first time about what it meant to 
love someone? It means to delight in what’s good for the other person, 
to take pleasure in doing everything that makes the other person 
happy. Isn’t that so?” Again, silence and caresses. “What's best for you 
will also give me pleasure. But you must decide what's best for you. 
Why be so distressed about it? If you're all right, then I will be too.” 

These halting words, repeated many times with slight variations, 
took up a considerable length of time, which was painful for both 
Lopukhov and Vera Pavlovna. But calming down gradually, Vera Pav- 
lovna at last began to breathe more easily. She embraced her husband 
warmly and repeated just as warmly, “I want to love you, my dear, you 
alone. I don’t wish to love anyone else.” 

He didn't point out to her that this was beyond her control. It was 
essential to let some time pass so that her strength would be restored 
by her settling calmly on some one thought or other, it didn’t matter 
which. Lopukhov managed to write a note that he gave Masha to 
deliver to Kirsanov in case he should come: “Alexander, don’t come in 
just now. Don't visit us for a little while. There’s nothing wrong, nor 
will there be. She just needs some rest.” “She just needs some rest,” 
and “there’s nothing wrong’—what a wonderful combination! Kir- 
sanov came, read the note, told Masha that he’d come for the note, 
that he had no time to stay because he had to go somewhere else, and 
that he'd call in on his way home when he'd done what was requested 
in the note. 


The evening passed by peacefully, to all appearances. Vera Pavlovna 
spent half the time sitting quietly in her own room, having sent her 
husband away; the rest of the time he sat next to her and comforted 
her with the same few words, but even more, of course, by the fact that 
his voice was calm and serene. Of course, it wasn't wildly cheerful, but 
neither was it mournful; rather it was thoughtful, as was his face. Vera 
Pavlovna heard this tone of voice and looked at the expression on his 


264 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


face; she began to think, not completely, but somewhat (no, not some- 
what, but almost completely), that there really was nothing at all the 
matter, that she had mistaken a simple fancy for a strong passion, and 
that it would dissipate in a few days, leaving no trace whatsoever. Or 
else she reasoned that she wasn’t thinking it, rather just feeling that it 
wasn’t so. Of course! It wasn’t so! Yes, yes, it was. More and more firmly 
she believed that she was indeed thinking it. And indeed she was, she 
really was. . . . Besides, how could one help thinking it while listening 
to Lopukhov's calm and serene voice; he kept repeating that there 
really was nothing wrong. She fell fast asleep listening to his voice; she 
slept soundly, dreamed of no night visitors, and awoke late the next 
morning feeling renewed vigor. 


XXV. 


“The best distraction from thinking is work,” thought Vera Pavlovna, 
and she was quite right. “I'll spend every day in the workshop until I’m 
completely cured. That will help me.” 

So she began to spend every day in the workshop. The first day she 
really was sufficiently distracted from thinking; on the second, she was 
merely exhausted, but hardly distracted from her thoughts; by the 
third day, she wasn't distracted in the least. Thus one week passed by. 

The struggle was difficult. Vera Pavlovna’s face grew pale. But her 
outward appearance was quite calm; she tried to seem cheerful and 
even succeeded in doing so without lapses. But if no one noticed 
anything and her pallor was ascribed to some slight indisposition, 
how could Lopukhov be deceived? He already knew the entire situa- 
tion; he didn’t even have to look at her. 

“Verochka,” he said a week later, “we're living together as if bearing 
witness to the truth of the old adage that a cobbler always goes around 
barefoot and the tailor’s clothes always fit him badly. We teach others 
to live according to our economic principles, while we ourselves re- 
fuse to organize our own life accordingly. One large household is more 
advantageous than several small ones, isn’t it? I would like to apply 
that rule to our own household. If we began to live with someone, then 
the two of us as well as those who lived with us would begin to save 
almost half of our expenses. I could give up these damned lessons that 
I detest so; my salary from the job at the factory would be sufficient. I 
could relax, pursue my scholarly work, and renew my own career. Of 
course, we must select only people we could get along with. What do 
you think?” 

For some time now Vera Pavlovna had been looking at her husband 


What Is to Be Done? 265 


with suspicious eyes, burning with indignation, just as Kirsanov had 
looked at Lopukhov on the occasion of their theoretical discussion. 
When he finished talking her face was on fire. 

“I beg you to stop this talk. It’s utterly inappropriate.” 

“Why, Verochka? I’m speaking only about financial advantage. Peo- 
ple of modest means like us can’t ignore such considerations. My work 
is difficult, some of it even detestable.” 

“IT won't allow you to talk to me in that way,” Vera Pavlovna said and 
got up. “I won't allow you to use such obscure phrases. Have the 
courage to say what you mean.” 

“IT only wanted to say, Verochka, that considering our own advan- 
tage, it would be a good idea for us to...” 

“Again! Silence! Who gave you the right to patronize me? I shall 
come to hate you!” She quickly left and locked herself in her own 
room. 

This was their first and last quarrel. 

Vera Pavlovna remained locked in her own room until late that 
evening. Then she went into her husband's room. 

“I said such stern words to you, my dear,” she said. “But don’t be 
angry. You see that I’m engaged in a struggle. Instead of trying to 
support me, you began to lend assistance precisely to what I’m strug- 
gling against, hoping, yes, hoping to prevail.” 

“Forgive me, my dear, for beginning in such a crude manner. Are we 
reconciled now? Let’s have a little talk.” 

“Oh, yes, we are reconciled, my dear. But don’t work against me. I've 
enough trouble struggling against myself.” 

“It’s to no purpose, Verochka. You've allowed yourself time to exam- 
ine your own feelings; now you can see that it’s more serious than you 
wanted to believe at first. Why torture yourself?” 

“No, my dear, I still want to love you and I don’t want to hurt you in 
any way.” 

“My friend, you want what's best for me. Well, do you think I enjoy 
or require your continued suffering?” 

“But you love me so much, my dear.” 

“Of course I do, Verochka, very much; that goes without saying. But 
you and I understand what love is. Isn’t it when a person rejoices in 
the joy and suffers from the suffering of the loved one? In tormenting 
yourself, you'll torment me.” 

“That's true, my dear. But you will suffer if I submit to this feeling. I 
don’t know why it ever arose in me. I curse it!” 

“How it arose and why it did doesn’t really matter. It can’t be helped. 
Now there’s only one choice left: either you suffer, and I do too, or you 
curtail your suffering, and mine too.” 


266 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“But I won't suffer, my dear. It will pass. You'll see, it will.” 

“Thanks for your efforts. I appreciate them because they show that 
you have the will to do what you think necessary. But understand, 
Verochka, your efforts seem necessary only to you, not to me. Looking 
at your situation from the outside, I can see it more clearly than you. I 
know that your efforts will be useless. Struggle on, as long as your 
strength permits. But don’t worry about hurting me. You know how I 
look at it; my opinion is unshakable and is in fact justified. But you 
understand all this. Can you really expect to deceive me? Will you ever 
lose your respect for me? I can say more. If your affection for me ever 
changes, will it really diminish? Isn’t the opposite true? Won't it in- 
crease because you didn’t discover me to be your enemy? Don't feel 
sorry for me. In no way will my fate be pitiable, because you haven't 
been deprived of happiness on my account. But enough of this. I find 
it painful to speak about it for very long and it must be even more 
painful for you to hear it. Remember, Verochka, what I have said. 
Forgive me, Verochka. Go back and think it over. Even better, get some 
sleep. Don’t think about me; think about yourself instead. Only in 
thinking about yourself can you prevent me from experiencing unnec- 
essary anguish.” 


XXVi. 


Some two weeks later, while Lopukhov was sitting in his factory 
office, Vera Pavlovna spent an entire morning in a state of extreme 
agitation. She threw herself down on the bed and covered her face 
with her hands; a quarter of an hour later she jumped up, paced 
around the room, and dropped into an armchair. She began to pace 
again with unsteady, jerky movements; then she threw herself down 
on the bed, paced again, went over to her desk several times, stood by 
it, and then ran away. Finally she sat down, wrote a few words, and 
sealed the envelope. Half an hour later she seized the note, tore it up, 
burned the shreds, and resumed pacing. Then she wrote another 
letter, tore it up too, burned the shreds, and resumed pacing. Once 
again she wrote a letter; then, hurriedly, scarcely managing to seal it, 
ran into her husband's room and threw it onto his desk, ran back to 
her own room, fell into an armchair, and sat there motionless, cover- 
ing her face with her hands. Half an hour passed, perhaps even a 
whole hour. Then a bell rang: it was he. She ran into his room to 
recover the letter, tear it up, and burn the shreds. Where was it? Not 
there! Where on earth was it? She rifled hastily through his papers. 
Where was it? Masha was already opening the door; from the thresh- 


What Is to Be Done? 267 


old Lopukhov could see that Vera Pavlovna was fleeing from his study 
and running back to her own room. She was pale and distraught. 

He didn't go after her; instead he went into his study. Coolly and 
slowly he examined his desk and the area near it. For several days he’d 
been expecting something of this sort, either a conversation or a letter. 
And here it was: a letter, with no address, bearing her seal. Of course, 
she must have been searching for it to destroy it, or she had just 
delivered it. No, she must have been looking for it. His papers were in 
disarray. But how could she possibly have found it? She must have 
been in such a feverish state to have thrown it so violently; like a hot 
coal burning her hand, it had slid the length of the desktop and 
landed on the windowsill nearby. There was almost no need to read it; 
he knew its contents already. Still, how could he refrain from reading 
it? 

“My dear, I have never been so attached to you as I am now. If only I 
could die for you! Oh, how happy I'd be to die, if only it would make 
you happier! However, I cannot live without him. I’m hurting you, my 
dear, killing you, my friend, and I don’t wish to do so. I'm acting 
against my own will. Forgive me, forgive me.” 

For a quarter of an hour, perhaps even longer, Lopukhov stood at his 
desk and stared at the arm of the chair next to him. Although he’d 
expected this blow, it was still very painful; although he’d thought it all 
out and had decided exactly what to do after receiving such a letter or 
hearing such a confession, nevertheless he was unable to collect his 
thoughts right away. At last he did so. He went into the kitchen to deal 
with Masha. “Please wait to serve dinner until I tell you. I don’t feel 
very well and must take some medicine before dinner. But don’t you 
wait. Have your dinner, and don't hurry. There's plenty of time before I 
can eat. I'll tell you when.” 

From the kitchen he went in to his wife’s room. She lay there bury- 
ing her face in a pillow. Hearing him enter, she shuddered and said, 
“You found it and read it! My God, I must be mad! It's not true! It was 
only my fever.” 

“Of course, my friend, your words cannot be taken seriously because 
you were too agitated. Such matters aren't decided so easily. You and I 
will have plenty of time to consider this affair and talk it over calmly, 
since it’s so very important to us both. Meanwhile, my friend, I'd like to 
tell you about my business. I've managed to make rather a lot of 
changes, all the ones that were needed, and now I'm verysatisfied. Are 
you listening?” Needless to say, she didn’t know whether she was 
listening or not. She could have answered only that whether she lis- 
tened or not, she did hear something, only she didn't really care to 
understand what it was. Nevertheless she did hear something and she 


268 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


was able to discern that it related to something entirely different and 
had nothing whatever to do with her letter. Gradually she began to 
listen because she was drawn into it. Her nerves were eager to be 
distracted by something other than that letter. Although she was un- 
able to understand very much for quite a long time, she was still 
reassured by the cool and satisfied tone of her husband's voice. Then 
she even began to understand what he was saying. 

“You should be listening because these things matter to me,” her 
husband continued, after asking whether or not she was listening. 
“Yes, some very pleasant changes,” he said and began to describe 
them in great detail. But she knew about three-quarters of it already. 
No, she knew all of it, but no matter. Let him talk on. How kind he is! 
And talk on he did: how he was fed up with giving lessons, why he was 
annoyed with a particular family or a certain pupil, how he was not 
fed up with his work in the factory office because it was so important 
and afforded him considerable influence over the workers, and what 
he was managing to achieve there. He'd rounded up some volunteers 
interested in promoting literacy and had taught them how to teach; 
he’d secured payment for them from the factory, having demonstrated 
that literate workers would be less likely to ruin machinery or spoil the 
work, because there would be less absenteeism and drunkenness on 
the job. The payment for these teachers was trifling, of course. Then he 
told her how he was rescuing workers from drunkenness; to do so he 
was often frequenting their taverns. He said a great deal more. The 
main thing was that he’d succeeded in establishing himself at the 
factory as a competent and resourceful person who'd gradually taken 
matters into his own hands. The conclusion of his story and the tast- 
iest morsel of all, as far as Lopukhov was concerned, was this: he was 
to be promoted to the position of assistant manager of the factory. The 
manager would become an honorary position, held by a trustee of the 
firm who would receive a nominal salary. But Lopukhov would be 
the actual manager. The trustee of the firm agreed to accept the hon- 
orary position as manager only on this one condition. “I can’t,” he 
said, “it’s beyond me.” “Well, you should accept the position so that an 
honest man will occupy the post. There’s no need to interfere in the 
actual business. I shall run it.” “Well, if that’s the case, then fine. I'll 
accept the position.” But it’s not so much the power that’s important, 
but the fact that Lopukhov now receives a salary of 3500 rubles, almost 
a thousand more than he got before from all his other jobs including 
his previous post at the factory, his occasional literary hackwork, and 
his tutoring. Consequently, he’s now able to give up everything except 
for the work at the factory, and that’s excellent. 

He went on talking for more than half an hour; at the end of his 


What Is to Be Done? 269 


narrative Vera Pavlovna was able to agree that it really was very fine 
indeed. She was even able to rearrange her hair and come to dinner. 

After dinner Masha was given eighty kopecks in silver for a cab to 
take a note to four different places announcing that Lopukhov was free 
that evening and would be glad to receive guests. In a short while the 
horrible Rakhmetov appeared; after him little by little a whole band of 
young people assembled. There began a fierce learned discussion, 
accompanied by an inordinate number of accusations of each in turn 
by the rest for all possible violations of logic. A few traitors to the noble 
art of debate enabled Vera Pavlovna to while away the evening; about 
halfway through she suddenly realized where Masha had been sent. 
How kind he was! Yes, this time Vera Pavlovna was absolutely de- 
lighted with her young friends, even though she didn’t take part in 
their fun, but only sat by quietly. Why, she was even prepared to kiss 
Rakhmetov himself! 

The guests left around three a.m.—late, but that was actually a good 
thing in itself. Vera Pavlovna, exhausted by the excitement of the day, 
had just gone to bed when her husband entered. 

“When I was telling you about the factory, my dear Verochka, I forgot 
to mention one thing about my new position. It’s really not all that 
important, and it’s hardly worth mentioning, but I'll tell you all the 
same, just in case. However, I have one request to make. I'm ready to 
go to sleep and so are you. If I don't finish telling you all about it, we 
can talk again tomorrow. But for now I'll tell it to you briefly. You see, I 
agreed to accept the position of assistant manager on one condition: 
that I could begin work when I wanted to, a month or so from now, 
even two. I want to make use of this time. I haven’t seen my parents in 
Ryazan}57 for the last five years. I plan to go visit them. Good-bye, 
Verochka. Don’t get up now. There'll be time tomorrow. Go to sleep.” 


XxVvil. 


The next day when Vera Pavlovna emerged from her room, her 
husband and Masha were already stuffing two suitcases with his 
things. And all the time Masha was there; she never stepped out. 
Lopukhov had given her so many things to wrap, fold, pack, and re- 
pack that she had no opportunity to leave. “Verochka, would you help 
us, too?” And the three of them drank tea together, all the while sorting 
and packing his things. Vera Pavlovna scarcely had time to collect her

about 100 miles southeast of Moscow.

wits when her husband announced, “It’s ten thirty—time to leave for 
the railway station.” 

“Tl go with you, my dear.” 

“Verochka, my friend, I’m taking along two suitcases. There won't be 
anywhere to sit. You can ride with Masha.” 

“That's not what I mean. I’m going to Ryazan with you.” 

“Well, then, in that case, Masha can go with the suitcases and we 
can ride together.” 

The street is not particularly well suited to emotional outpourings. 
Besides, there was so much noise coming from the pavement. Lopu- 
khov had difficulty hearing her, while she could hardly understand his 
replies even when he made any. 

“I’m going to Ryazan with you,” Vera Pavlovna repeated again and 
again. 

“But your things aren't ready. How can you go? Get ready if you like. 
Do whatever you think best. But I have one request: wait until you 
receive a letter from me. It will come tomorrow. I'll write you one and 
mail it along the way. You'll get it tomorrow. Wait for it, I beg of you.” 

How she embraced him at the gallery of the station! How tearfully 
she kissed him as he entered the gate to the platform. Meanwhile he 
kept talking about his affairs at the factory, how well things were going, 
how delighted his parents would be to see him, how everything in the 
world is nonsense except one’s health, and how she should take good 
care of herself. At the very moment of parting, through the bars of the 
fence, he said to her, “Yesterday you wrote that you’d never been so 
attached to me as you are now. That's true, my dear Verochka. And I'm 
no less attached to you. Affection for a person means desiring his 
happiness, as you and I know full well. Furthermore, there’s no happi- 
ness without freedom. You didn't want to restrain me, nor I you. If you 
ever felt restrained by me, you would hurt me. Don't do that; do only 
what's best for you. Then we'll see. You write me and tell me when to 
return. Good-bye, my friend. That’s the second bell. It’s time to go. 
Good-bye.”

This happened at the end of April. Lopukhov came back in the 
middle of June. He spent three weeks in Petersburg and then went 
on to Moscow on factory business, as he said. He left Moscow on the 
ninth of June. On the morning of the eleventh there occurred the 
baffling incident in the hotel at the Moscow Railway Station when 


What Is to Be Done? 271 


the guest could not be awakened, followed two hours later by the 
scene at the dacha on Kamenny [Stone] Island.158 

Surely now the perceptive reader can no longer fail to guess who it 
was who shot himself. “I've known for some time that it was Lopu- 
khov,” he says, thrilled by his own perspicacity. Well then, what's 
become of him? How was it that his cap was shot right through the 
band? “There’s no need for that! It was merely one of his tricks. And he 
himself was helping to drag the river for his own corpse, that rascal,” 
proclaims the perceptive reader. Well, God be with you, whatever you 
say, for there's no way to talk you out of it. 


xxix. An Extraordinary Man’? 


About three hours after Kirsanov left, Vera Pavlovna came to her 
senses; one of her first thoughts was that her workshop could not be 
abandoned. Yes, even though Vera Pavlovna loved to assert that the 
enterprise could run by itself, in reality she knew that she was merely 
flattering herself with that idea. In fact, the workshop needed a super- 
visor or the whole thing would collapse. On the other hand, now that 
the business was so well established, very little in the way of supervi- 
sion was actually required. Natasha Mertsalova had two children;!69 
even so, she could spare an hour to an hour and a half a day, although 
not every day. Surely she wouldn’t refuse, since she was doing so 
much work in the shop now. Vera Pavlovna began to sort through her 
personal effects. First she sent Masha to ask Natasha to stop by, then 
to an old woman named Rachel who dealt in used clothes and other 
items. One of the most resourceful of Jewish women, but still a good 


158. See n. 4 above. 

159. Chernyshevsky seems to have drawn on both Orthodox hagiography and the life 
of a fellow radical in creating the character of Rakhmetov. On the one hand, Rakhmetov’s 
biography closely resembles the model presented in a popular saint's life, The Life of 
Aleksei, a Man of God: a wealthy nobleman undergoes a religious conversion, gives away 
all his property, renounces worldly success, forgoes the love of a woman, dedicates 
himself to faith, and subjects his body to incredible self-mortification in his efforts to 
resist temptation. At the same time, Rakhmetov’s actions also resemble those of Pavel 
Aleksandrovich Bakhmetev (1828—?), a noble landowner from Saratov province who un- 
derwent a political conversion, embraced radical ideas, sold all his property in 1857, 
entrusting the proceeds to Alexander Herzen (see Introduction, p. 6) to be used for the 
cause, and eventually emigrated to either the Marquesas Islands or New Zealand. 

160. The small role played by children in What Is to Be Done? is striking. They hardly 
appear in the novel; when present they act primarily as servants, as in Vera's sewing 
cooperative and in the utopian world of her fourth dream. Even the heroine’s own child 
disappears after demonstrating the fruitfulness of her love for Kirsanov. 


272 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


friend of Vera Pavlovna’s,!®! Rachel was absolutely honest with her, as 
are almost all small Jewish tradespeople when dealing with decent 
people. Rachel and Masha had to stop by the apartment in town to 
collect the dresses and other garments that had been left there, then 
call in at the furrier’s where Vera Pavlovna’s coats had been left in 
storage for the summer, and finally bring the whole pile out to the 
dacha, where Rachel would price the goods and purchase the whole 
lot at once. 

Just as Masha was leaving, she was met by Rakhmetov, who'd been 
wandering around near the dacha for the last half hour or so. 

“Are you going out, Masha? For very long?” 

“Yes. I probably won't be back until late this evening. I have a lot to 
do.” 

“Is Vera Pavlovna home alone?” 

“She is.” 

“Then I'll drop in and stay with her in your place. She may need 
something.” 

“Please do, or else I'll worry about her. Besides, I've forgotten some- 
thing, Mr. Rakhmetov. Could you call on the neighbors (they have a 
cook and a nanny, both friends of mine) and ask them to order her 
dinner? She still hasn’t eaten.” 

“Never mind. I haven't had my dinner either, and we can dine by 
ourselves. Have you eaten?” 

“Yes, Vera Pavlovna wouldn't let me go out unless I had.” 

“Well, that’s good. I was afraid she might have forgotten about you in 
her present condition.” 

With the exception of Masha and those who were her equals or 
superiors in simplicity of soul or dress, everyone was somewhat afraid 
of Rakhmetov. Even Lopukhov, Kirsanov, and all those who feared 
nothing and no one at times felt some trepidation before him. He held 
himself very removed from Vera Pavlovna. She found him boring; he 
never joined her circle of friends. But he was Masha’s favorite, even 
though he was less amiable and less talkative with her than other 
guests were. 

“I've come without an invitation, Vera Pavlovna,” he began. “But I've 
seen Alexander Matveich and I know everything. Therefore, in the 
event that you require my services, I've decided to spend the evening 
at your place.” 

His services might indeed have been required, even at once. He 
could have helped Vera Pavlovna sort through the garments. Anyone 
other than Rakhmetov would have been invited to do so at that very 


161. Vera's friendship with Rachel represents the transcendence of religious differ- 
ences through revolutionary ideals as well as a criticism of the anti-Semitism prevalent

What Is to Be Done? 273 


moment, or might even have offered to help. But he didn’t offer and 
wasn't invited. Vera Pavlovna merely shook his hand and said sincerely 
that she was very grateful for his concern. 

“Tl sit in the study,” he replied. “Call me if you need anything. If 
someone comes, I'll open the door. No need to trouble yourself.” 

With these words he proceeded very serenely to the study, took a 
large piece of ham and a chunk of black bread (weighing almost four 
pounds in all) from his pocket, sat down, ate everything up, chewing it 
all very well, and drank half a carafe of water. Then he went over to the 
bookshelves and began to look for something to read. “Too well 
known,” “unoriginal,” “unoriginal,” “unoriginal,” “unoriginal.” This last 
word was applied to works by such writers as Macauley, Guizot, 
Thiers, Ranke and Gervinus.!& “Ah, now here's something I'm glad to 
find,” he said after reading the words on the spines of several heavy 
tomes: The Complete Collected Works of Newton. He began to thumb 
quickly through some of the volumes; at last he found what he’d been 
looking for. With a smile he said, “Here it is, right here, Observations on 
the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John.163 Yes, up to 
now I've lacked any substantial foundation in this branch of knowl- 
edge. Newton wrote this commentary in his old age, when he was half 
in his right mind and half insane. It’s the classical treatise on the 
connection between intellect and insanity. The question is one of

162. By contrasting Rakhmetov’s “originality” with the alleged “unoriginality” of some 
of the most popular historians of the mid-nineteenth century, Chernyshevsky criticizes 
the latter as apologists of the bourgeois order. In his most famous work, History of 
England from the Accession of James the Second (5 vols., 1849-1861), the English histo- 
rian Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859) vividly recreates the social world of seven- 
teenth-century England, albeit from a liberal and Protestant perspective. The French 
politician and historian Frangois Guizot (1787-1874) played a prominent role in the 
government of Louis Philippe (see nn. 24,34, and 41 above). His many writings on French 
history and European civilization largely reflect his conservative views and belief in 
constitutional monarchy. In addition to producing several voluminous and relatively 
superficial works on the French Revolution, the French statesman and historian 
Adolphe Thiers (1797-1877) also held several ministerial posts under Louis Philippe, 
opposed Napoleon III, and served briefly as president of the Third Republic (1871-1873). 
A member of the ill-fated Frankfurt Parliament during the revolution of 1848-1849, the 
German historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus (1805-1871) used his writings on European 
history and German literature to advocate liberal reform and national reunification. On 
von Ranke, see n. 22 above. 

163. The scientific investigations of Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), which resulted in 
discoveries of such far-reaching consequences as the laws of gravity and the composi- 
tion of white light, never shook his fervent belief in biblical prophecies. In his Observa- 
tions on the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John, first published posthu- 
mously in vol. 5 of The Complete Collected Works (5 vols., London, 1779-1785), Newton 
combined a scientific approach with his religious views to treat apocalyptic prophecies 
as predictions of future historical events. Henceforth, Chernyshevsky's fictional charac- 
ters, like Newton himself and other believers in apocalyptic predictions, began to calcu- 
late the time remaining before the prophecy of revolution was to be fulfilled. This period 
turned out to be two years from the time at which Chernyshevsky was writing the novel, 
i.e., 1865. 


274 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


universal, historical import: this particular combination occurs with- 
out exception in all events, in almost all books, in almost all brains. But 
here this question must appear in perfect form. In the first place, his 
mind was the most ingenious and most normal of all those known to 
us; in the second place, the insanity that affected it was both acknowl- 
edged and undisputed. Therefore, this book is the major work in its 
field. It should display the subtlest manifestations of the general phe- 
nomenon more tangibly than any other work; there can be no doubt 
whatever that these manifestations depict this particular combination 
of intellect and insanity. This book is worth studying.” And with plea- 
surable zeal he sat down to read a book that has hardly been read by 
anyone but its original proofreaders for a hundred years or so. Anyone 
else would have found this book as tasty a dish as sand or sawdust. 
But Rakhmetov considered it a delicious morsel. 

Nowadays there are only a few people like Rakhmetov. Up to the 
present time I’ve met only eight examples of this breed (among them 
two women).!64 They weren't at all alike except for one characteristic. 
The group includes both stern and gentle types, somber and cheerful, 
energetic and phlegmatic, sentimental and perpetually imperturbable. 
(One had a stern face, sarcastic to the point of impudence; another, a 
wooden face, taciturn and indifferent to everything. Both wept in my 
presence several times, like hysterical women, not because of their 
own affairs, but rather in the middle of conversations on diverse mat- 
ters. I'm sure they often cried when they were alone, too.) They had 
nothing in common except for one trait, but this trait united them into 
a single breed and distinguished them from all others. I used to laugh 
at those particular individuals, my intimate friends, when I was alone 
with them. They either got angry or didn't, but they also used to laugh 
at themselves. In fact, there was a great deal that was very amusing 
about them: everything of importance about them was amusing, every- 
thing that characterized them as a breed apart. I love to laugh at such 
people. 

The one I met in Lopukhov's and Kirsanov’s circle, and whom I shall 
describe here, serves as living proof that a proviso needs to be added 
to that discussion of the properties of soil between Lopukhov and 
Mertsalov in Vera Pavlovna’s second dream.!6& The proviso is that 
whatever the quality of the soil, one can still come across tiny plots 
capable of producing healthy ears of grain. The genealogy of the main 
characters of my story (Vera Pavlovna, Kirsanov, and Lopukhov), if truth 


164. Chernyshevsky altered the number of these people in various drafts of his novel. 
Their precise identity also remains unknown, although scholars have proposed several 
likely candidates, including Nikolai Dobrolyubov (see n. 11 above), Pavel Bakhmetev (see 
n. 159 above), and Chernyshevsky himself.

What Is to Be Done? 275 


be told, goes no farther back than their grandparents; only with a great 
deal of effort could one discover a great-grandmother. (The great- 
grandfather has inevitably been obscured by the darkness of oblivion; 
all that’s known about him is that he was the great-grandmother’s 
husband and that his name was Kiril, because the grandfather was 
called Gerasim Kirilych). 

Rakhmetov was descended from a family known since the thir- 
teenth century, that is, from one of the oldest families not only in 
Russia but in all of Europe. Among the chiefs of the Tatar regiments 
massacred at Tver with their troops,1©§ (an event that, according to the 
chronicles, occurred because they'd intended to convert the people to 
the Muslim faith—an intention they probably never had, but an event 
that in fact took place simply because they were the oppressors), 
among those chiefs was one named Rakhmet. His young son by a 
Russian woman whom he'd abducted, the niece of the chief court 
steward at Tver (that is, the high court marshal and field marshal),167 
had been spared on account of his mother and was rebaptized from 
Latyfe to Mikhail. The Rakhmetovs were descended from this Latyfe/ 
Mikhail Rakhmetovich. At Tver they were boyars, in Moscow only 
grand officers of the tsar. During the last century in Petersburg, they 
were generals-in-chief, but not all by any means.168 The family had 
proliferated and there weren't enough ranks of general-in-chief to go 
around. The great-great-grandfather of our Rakhmetov was a friend of 
Ivan Ivanovich Shuvalov, who'd rescued him from the disgrace into 
which he’d fallen as a result of his friendship with Mtinnich.!69 His 


166. The massacre at Tver in 1327 appears to have been more closely related to the 
struggle between the princes of Moscow and Tver for predominance in northeastern 
Russia in the early fourteenth century than to the oppressiveness of Mongol rule, al- 
though that certainly played some role. 

167. Rakhmet is described as a Tatar temnik (translated here as “chief”), a high military 
leader directly subordinate to the khan. The Russian dvorskii (translated as “high court 
marshal and field marshal”) was at this time the high steward who managed a prince's 
household and landed estates and performed other important administrative, judicial, 
and sometimes military functions. Rakhmetov's mixed ancestry, though not unusual 
among the Russian nobility, may help explain his extraordinary character (but cf.nn. 13 
and 151 above). 

168. The transition of such men from somewhat independent boyars to bu- 
reaucratically organized state servitors bearing European titles reflects both the growth 
of Western influence and the transformation of appanage Rus’ into Muscovite and, 
ultimately, imperial Russia. Chernyshevsky may be trying to emphasize the growth of 
state power and the constancy of noble oppressiveness throughout these transfor- 
mations. 

169. A favorite of Empress Elizabeth (r. 1741-1762) and proponent of Westernization, 
Ivan Shuvalov (1727-1797) founded Moscow University in 1755 and the Imperial Acade- 
my of Arts in 1757. A prominent general under Peter the Great (r. 1682-1725) and power- 
ful political figure during the reign of Empress Anna (r. 1730-1740), the German émigré 
field marshal Count Burkhard Christoph Mtinnich (1683-1767) exercised considerable 
influence as coregent of the infant emperor Ivan VI (r. 1740-1741), but was disgraced and 
exiled to Siberia when Elizabeth seized the throne in 1741. 


276 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


great-grandfather was a colleague of Rumyantsev. He attained the rank 
of general-in-chief and was killed at the battle of Novi.17° His grand- 
father accompanied Alexander to Tilsit and would have gone further 
than any of the others, but he forfeited his career early as a result of a 
friendship with Speransky.!7! His father served without success or 
disgrace, and retired at the age of forty with the rank of lieutenant 
general; he settled on one of his several estates scattered along the 
upper reaches of the Medveditsa River. These estates, however, were 
not very large; they consisted of only about 2,500 souls in all.172 At the 
same time, given a large amount of rural leisure, he sired many chil- 
dren, about eight all told. Our Rakhmetov was the next to last; there 
was only one sister younger than he. As a result, our Rakhmetov was a 
man who had not too great an inheritance: he received only about 400 
souls and 7,000 desyatinas of land.173 No one knew how he'd disposed 
of the souls and 5,500 of his desyatinas; likewise, no one knew that 
he'd kept 1,500 desyatinas for himself. Nor did anyone even know that 
he was a member of the landed gentry, and that he had an income of 
about 3,000 rubles a year in rent on the remaining parcel of land. No 
one knew any of this while he lived among us. We learned it all later. 
Then, of course, we assumed that he must have belonged to that 
family of Rakhmetovs among whom were numbered many wealthy 
landowners—whose combined worth was estimated at 75,000 souls 
on various estates along the upper reaches of the Medveditsa, Kho- 
pior, Sura, and Tsna rivers, and who are always serving as district 
marshals of those places and who, one or another, are constantly 
serving as provincial marshals in one or another of the three provinces 


170. Count Peter Rumyantsev (1725-1796) proved to be one of Russia’s most successful 
generals in the latter part of the eighteenth century, particularly during the Seven Years' 
War and Catherine the Great's Turkish wars. On August 4, 1799, a joint Russian and 
Austrian army commanded by the Russian field marshal Alexander Suvorov defeated a 
large French army near the northern Italian town of Novi. 

171. In July 1807, at Tilsit in East Prussia, Emperor Alexander I (r. 1801-1825) and 
Napoleon [ concluded a peace treaty that restructured Central Europe, included Russia 
in Napoleon's blockade of British trade, and led to Russia’s acquisition of Finland. Count 
Mikhail Speransky (1772-1839), the son of a village priest who rose to become an influen- 
tial adviser to Alexander I in the early years of his reign, ultimately fell from grace when 
his liberal proposals for administrative, financial, and legal reform encountered power- 
ful opposition. In this passage Chernyshevsky uses Rakhmetov's lineage to demonstrate 
the patriotism, bravery, leadership, and, in the last instance, enlightenment inherent in 
his superhero's family line, despite the reactionary attitudes of his father. 

172. Before the abolition of serfdom in 1861, a noble landowner's wealth was mea- 
sured by the number of male serfs, or “souls,” that he possessed. Rakhmetov's father’s 
holdings place him among the wealthiest 4% of all noble landowners at that time. 

173. A desyatina was a measure of land equal to about 2.7 acres. This passage reflects 
the pernicious effects of Russian inheritance law, under which all sons inherited both 
their father’s title and an equal share of his estate. As a result, holdings tended to 
become fragmented and increasingly smaller with each generation. 


What Is to Be Done? 277 


where the upper reaches of these same rivers flow through their an- 
cestral lands.17* We knew that our friend Rakhmetov lived on an in- 
come of about 400 rubles a year. For a student in those days, that 
wasn't a small sum at all, but for a landowner of the Rakhmetov family, 
it was a very small sum indeed. That's why each of us, who hardly 
concerned ourselves with such inquiries, merely assumed without 
asking that our Rakhmetov was a member of some declining branch of 
the family which had lost its lands, the son of some councillor in a 
provincial office of the Ministry of Finance who'd left his children a 
little capital.17> And who could expect us to be interested in such 
things, anyway? 

He was now twenty-two years old, having been a student since the 
age of sixteen. He'd interrupted his studies for almost three years. At 
the end of his second year he left to take charge of his estate, overcom- 
ing his guardian's opposition, incurring his brothers’ curses, and caus- 
ing his brothers-in-law to forbid his sisters ever to mention his name 
again.!76 Then he wandered through Russia traveling in various ways: 
on land and over water, by both ordinary and extraordinary means (on 
foot, by flat-bottomed boat, and by keeled ship).!177 He had many adven- 
tures, most of which he devised himself. Meanwhile, he supported two 
students at Kazan University and five at Moscow University at his own 
expense; but he brought no one along with him to Petersburg, where 
he himself planned to live. Therefore none of us knew that instead of 
400 rubles, he had an income of some 3,000 rubles. This fact became 
known only later; at that time we knew only that he’d disappeared 
from sight and that he’d returned to Petersburg some two years before 
that day he sat in Kirsanov’s study analyzing Newton's interpretation 
of the Apocalypse. Now he'd joined the philological faculty; before 
then he’d been studying the natural sciences. That was all we knew. 

But if none of Rakhmetov's Petersburg friends knew anything about 
his family background or his financial situation, everyone who knew 
him was very familiar with his two nicknames. One has already been 


174. The Medveditsa and Tsna rivers are located to the northwest, the Sura and Kho- 
pior rivers considerably east, of Moscow. Elected by local nobility under the administra- 
tive system created by Catherine the Great, district and provincial marshals of the 
nobility performed an important role in local administration and occupied a prominent 
position in provincial society. 

175. A provincial post that conferred extremely low social status. Impoverished nobles 
frequently took refuge in provincial service, where they formed part of the core of 
Russia’s growing landless bureaucracy in the nineteenth century. 

176. This sentence suggests that Rakhmetov incurred both his guardian's opposition 
and his brothers’ curses for freeing his serfs and providing them with allotments of land. 

177. A rasshiva was a large, flat-bottomed sailboat with pointed prow and stern used 
extensively on the Volga River and the Caspian Sea. A kosnaya lodka was a lighter, keeled 
craft.

mentioned in the course of this narrative, namely, “the rigorist.” He 
accepted it with his usual slight smile of grim satisfaction. But when 
people started calling him Nikitushka or Lomov, or by the full form, 
Nikitushka Lomov,!78 he beamed broadly and sweetly, and for good 
reason. It was not by his birthright but by sheer strength of will that 
he'd acquired a right to bear a name so renowned among millions of 
people. This name thunders with glory along a strip of land some 
hundred versts wide across eight provinces. For readers who reside in 
the rest of Russia's territory, the meaning of this name must be ex- 
plained. Nikitushka Lomov was a barge hauler who worked along the 
Volga River some fifteen or twenty years ago and was a giant of Her- 
culean strength. He was two arshins and fifteen vershoks tall;!79 he 
was so broad in the chest and shoulders that he weighed some fifteen 
puds;!8° and he was solid, not fat. One fact will suffice to illustrate his 
strength: he received the salary of four men. Whenever his vessel ar- 
rived at a town, he would go to the market (or the “bazaar,” as it is 
called along the Volga). All along the way boys would cry out from dis- 
tant back streets, “Nikitushka Lomov! Here comes Nikitushka Lomov!” 
They all ran out into the streets leading from the harbor to the bazaar, 
and a whole crowd of people would follow along behind their Russian 
bogatyr. 

When Rakhmetov came to Petersburg at the age of sixteen, he was 
an ordinary youth of somewhat above-average height and strength, 
but by no means remarkable. Out of any ten of his peers, two could 
probably have gotten the better of him. But in the middle of his seven- 
teenth year he decided to acquire physical prowess and began to work 
hard at it. He took up gymnastics with considerable dedication. That 
was all right, but gymnastics can improve only the material available; 
one has to provide oneself with such material. And so, for a while, he 
spent several hours every day, twice as long as he practiced gymnas- 
tics, working at common labor that required physical strength. He 
carried water, chopped and hauled firewood, felled trees, cut stone, 
dug earth, and forged iron. He tried many different kinds of work and

178. A legendary folk hero in the bogatyr tradition of morally pure men who are also 
large and mighty warriors, Nikitushka Lomov appeared in tales from the Volga region as 
a defender of the common people. By linking Rakhmetov to such a figure, Chernyshev- 
sky compares his hero with legendary bogatyrs of Russia’s past, demonstrates his soli- 
darity with the common people, and indicates Rakhmetov’s transformation through 
labor into a “new man” combining the best qualities of both the intelligentsia and the 
working class.

diet. He began to nourish himself (precisely!) only on those things 
reputed to build physical strength—beefsteak most of all, almost raw; 
since that time he’s continued on this regimen. About a year after 
adopting this program, he set off on his travels and had even greater 
opportunities to devote himself to building physical strength. He 
worked as a plowman, carpenter, ferryman, and laborer at all sorts of 
healthful trades. Once he even worked as a barge hauler along the 
whole length of the Volga, from Dubovka to Rybinsk.18! If he’d told the 
captain of the barge and the crew that he wanted to work as a barge 
hauler, they'd have considered it the height of stupidity and would 
never have accepted him. So he went aboard as a passenger and 
became friendly with the crew and began to help them tow the boat. 
In a week he buckled himself into a harness, just like a real barge 
hauler. Soon they realized his strength and put him to the test: he 
outpulled three or four men, the sturdiest of his comrades. He was 
only twenty years old at the time, and his comrades on the barge 
christened him Nikitushka Lomov, in memory of their hero, who'd 
already departed the scene. The next summer he was traveling on a 
steamer. One of the many common folk on deck turned out to be one 
of his fellow workers from the barge the year before; that was how 
some students, his fellow travelers, learned about his nickname, Niki- 
tushka Lomov. In fact, he had acquired and, without skimping on time, 
had maintained enormous strength. “It’s necessary,” he used to say. 
“It inspires respect and love of the common people. It’s useful and 
may come in handy someday.” 

This idea had occurred to him when he was sixteen and a half, 
because it was then that his peculiar personality first began to devel- 
op. At the age of sixteen he’d come to Petersburg a nice, ordinary lad, 
having just completed his course of study at the gymnasium; he was a 
kind, honest young man who spent three or four months in the usual 
way, as all new students do. But soon he began to hear that among his 
comrades were some very clever minds whose way of thinking differed 
from that of others. He found out the names of five or six of these 
students; there were still only a few of them then. They interested him 
and he began to seek the acquaintance of some of them. He happened 
to become friendly with Kirsanov; that initiated the process of his 
rebirth into an extraordinary man, the future “Nikitushka Lomov” and 
“rigorist.” The first evening he listened to Kirsanov avidly; he wept and 
interrupted Kirsanov’s words with exclamations that cursed the

things that must perish and blessed those that must survive.'82 He 
asked, “What books should I read first?” Kirsanov answered him. At 
eight o'clock the next morning he was up and walking along Nevsky 
Prospekt from the Admiralty to the Politseisky [Police] Bridge,!83 wait- 
ing to see which German or French bookstore would open first. He 
acquired what he needed and then read for more than three days and 
nights in a row, from 11 a.m. on Thursday to 9 p.m. on Sunday, a total of 
eighty-two hours. The first two nights he had no trouble staying 
awake; the third night he drank eight glasses of strong coffee. By the 
fourth night even the coffee didn’t help: he collapsed on the floor and 
slept for about fifteen hours. A week later he went to Kirsanov and 
demanded to know what books he should read next and to get some 
explanations. He became good friends with Kirsanov and through him 
met Lopukhov. Half a year later, though Rakhmetov was only seven- 
teen and the others were already twenty-one, they no longer thought 
of him as a “young man,” but as an “extraordinary man.” 

What sort of influential factors were there in his early life? Not many, 
but some. His father was a man with a despotic disposition, very 
intelligent, well educated, and ultraconservative, in the same sense 
that Marya Aleksevna was ultraconservative, although he was an hon- 
est man. Needless to say, Rakhmetov had a difficult time at home. But 
that alone would not have been sufficient. In addition, his mother was 
a rather delicate creature who suffered from her husband's severe 
character. Besides, the boy himself could see what life was really like 
in the countryside. But even this would not have been sufficient. 
Here’s the rest of it: at the age of fifteen he fell in love with one of his 
father’s mistresses. This occasioned a great scandal, of course, and the 
brunt of it fell on the woman. He felt sorry for her because she had to 
suffer so much on his account. His thoughts began to stir; Kirsanov 
played the same role for him as Lopukhov had forVera Pavlovna. There 
were, therefore, influential factors in his early life. 

However, in the making of such an extraordinary man, of course the 
principal element had to have been nature. For some time before he’d 
left the university and had set off for his own estate, and later on his 
journey through Russia, he’d already adopted a set of original princi- 
ples to govern his material, moral, and spiritual life. When he returned 
to Petersburg, these principles had already developed into a complete 
system, which he followed faithfully. He said to himself, “I shall not 
drink one drop of wine. I shall not touch any women.” But he was so

the emotional experience of religious conversion.

passionate by nature! “Why on earth? Such extreme measures are 
unnecessary!” “They are necessary. We demand complete enjoyment 
of life for all people. Therefore, in our own lives we must demonstrate 
that we demand this not to satisfy our own passions, not for ourselves 
alone, but for man in géneral. We must show that were speaking 
according to principles and not passions, according to convictions 
and not personal! desires.” 

Therefore he adopted a very austere way of life. To become and 
remain Nikitushka Lomov, he needed to eat beef, a great deal of beef. 
So he did. He regretted every kopeck he spent on any other kind of 
food. He ordered his landlady to purchase good quality beef, the very 
best cuts for him, yet everything else he ate at home was the cheapest. 
He gave up white bread and had only black bread at his table. For 
weeks at a time he never put a lump of sugar into his mouth;}84 for 
months at a time he ate no fruit, no veal, and no poultry. He would buy 
nothing of the sort with his own money. “I have no right to spend 
money on any luxuries I can do without.” Yet he’d been brought up on 
a sumptuous diet and had acquired refined tastes, as could be seen 
from his general remarks about food. Whenever he dined at someone 
else's table, he enjoyed many dishes that he refused to eat at his own 
table; there were also certain foods he refused even then. The reason 
for this distinction was sound: “Anything the common people eat on 
occasion, I too can eat on occasion. Anything that is never available to 
them, I too must never eat. This is essential so that I can appreciate 
how difficult their life is compared to mine.” Therefore, if fruit was 
served, he would always eat apples, but never apricots. He would eat 
oranges in Petersburg, but not in the provinces. You see, the common 
people do eat oranges in Petersburg, but not in the provinces. He 
ate meat-filled pastries because “a good meat pie is no worse than a 
meat-filled pastry, and puff pastry is certainly familiar to the common 
people.”185 But he wouldn't eat sardines. He dressed very modestly, 
although he loved elegance. In all other respects he maintained a 
Spartan way of life. For example, he wouldn't allow himself a straw 
mattress; he slept on a strip of felt, not even folding it double. 

However, there was one count on which he did feel remorse: he 
hadn't given up smoking. “Without my cigar, I can’t think. If that’s 
really so, then I'm right. But perhaps it’s a failure of will.” He couldn't

185. Russian cuisine abounds with all sorts of pies and pastries filled with a variety of 
meats, vegetables, and fish. Varying in size, these pastries range from the delicate and 
elaborate to the common, and can serve as either an hors d’oeuvre or a main dish.

tolerate bad cigars; after all, he was raised in aristocratic surroundings. 
Out of his 400-ruble income, almost 150 went for cigars. “An abomin- 
able weakness,” he used to say. But it was only this one weakness that 
made it possible to defend oneself against him. If he began to push his 
charges too far, the person under attack could say, “Well, perfection is 
impossible—even you smoke.” Then Rakhmetov would double his 
denunciations, directing a large share of his reproaches at himself; the 
other person would get a smaller share of abuse, but by no means 
would he be entirely forgotten. 

Rakhmetov managed to accomplish a great deal because in appor- 
tioning his time he imposed the same kind of limitations on his whims 
as he did on material things. Not a quarter of an hour a month was 
wasted on recreation; he needed no rest. “I have such a wide variety of 
pursuits,” he would say, “that switching from one to another con- 
stitutes a rest.” He spent no more time with his circle of friends (cen- 
tered on Kirsanov and Lopukhov) than was necessary to remain in 
close contact with them. “That's essential. Everyday occurrences dem- 
onstrate the usefulness of maintaining close contact with a certain 
circle of people. One must always have available sources of various 
kinds of information.” Other than visits to this circle, he never saw 
anyone except on business—and not for five minutes longer than that 
business required. He rarely received visitors and never allowed them 
to stay longer than their business required. Without any circumlocu- 
tions he would announce to his guests, “We've now concluded our 
business. Allow me to turn to other matters because I must guard my 
time.” 

During the first months of his rebirth he spent almost all his time 
reading. But this phase lasted only a little more than half a year. When 
he realized that he'd acquired a systematic way of thinking according 
to those principles he considered correct, he said to himself at once: 
“Now reading has become a matter of secondary importance. As far as 
that’s concerned, I’m now ready for life.” Then he began to devote to 
reading only the time that was free from other pursuits—and he had 
very little time of that sort. All the same, he extended the range of his 
knowledge with astonishing speed. Now, at the age of twenty-two, he 
was already a man of very solid erudition. This was because in this 
area he'd also established a rule: no luxuries or whims, only what was 
absolutely necessary. And what was that? He would say, “There are 
only a few fundamental works on every subject. All the rest merely 
repeat, dilute, and distort what’s more fully and clearly stated in these 
few fundamental works. One need read only those; anything else is a 
terrible waste of time. Take Russian literature, for example. I would

say, ‘I'll read Gogol first of all.18° In thousands of other stories I can see, 
by reading only five or so lines on five different pages, that I'll find 
nothing but a corruption of Gogol. Why should I read them? It’s the 
same in the sciences, even more obvious there. If I've read Adam 
Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, and Mill,187 then I know the alpha and omega 
of their school of thought; I’ve no need to read any of the other hun- 
dreds of political economists, however distinguished they may be. By 
reading only five lines on five different pages I can see that I won't find 
one fresh idea. Everything there is borrowed and distorted. I read only 
original works, and only enough to grasp their originality.” Therefore, 
there was absolutely no way to make him read Macaulay.!88 After 
spending a quarter of an hour glancing through various pages, he 
decided: “I know all the material from which these scraps are assem- 
bled.” He read Thackeray’s Vanity Fair with pleasure; then he began 
Pendennis, but closed it after reading only twenty pages.!89 “All this 
was Said before in Vanity Fair. Apparently he has nothing more to say, 
so there’s no need to read it.” “Every book I read spares me from 
having to read hundreds of others,” he used to say. 

Gymnastics, physical labor to develop his strength, and reading 
were Rakhmetov's personal pursuits. Upon his return to Petersburg 
these activities occupied only about a quarter of his time. The re- 


186. A brilliant satirist, Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) is famed for his scathing depiction of 
early-nineteenth-century Russian life in such masterpieces as “The Overcoat” (1842), The 
Inspector General (1836), and Dead Souls (1842, 1855) (see nn. 62 and 137 above). 

187. These are the four pillars of British classical political economy. In An Inquiry into 
the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), the Scottish economist Adam 
Smith provided a brilliant theoretical analysis and justification of the capitalist market 
economy, developing in particular the theory of the division of labor and the idea that 
pursuit of individual self-interest would bring about general well-being. In An Essay on 
the Principle of Population (1798; rev. ed. 1803), the English economist Thomas Robert 
Malthus (1766-1834) linked economic development to population growth and contend- 
ed that poverty was unavoidable because population increased more rapidly than the 
means of subsistence. The British economist David Ricardo (1772-1823) argued in The 
Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817) that wages tend to stabilize around 
the subsistence level and that the value of a good derives largely from the labor needed 
to produce it. The British philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), one 
of the most important liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century, stressed inductive 
reasoning and empiricism as the basis of knowledge, advocated social and political 
reforms, espoused women's rights, and defended the primacy of individual liberty. 
Chernyshevsky’s translation and critical discussion of Mill's Principles of Political Econ- 
omy (1848) appeared in Sovremennik in 1860-1861. 

188. See n. 162 above. 

189. The prolific English novelist and satirist William Makepeace Thackeray (1811- 
1863) published Vanity Fair, a critique of upper-middle-class life and values, in 1848 (Rus. 
trans. 1850) and the autobiographical novel Pendennis in 1850 (Rus. trans. 1852). Thack- 
eray was immensely popular in nineteenth-century Russia, but Chernyshevsky crit- 
icized his later works for failing to provide more pointed social commentary. 


284 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


mainder he devoted to matters of concern to others or to no one in 
particular,’8° constantly maintaining the same rule he had for his 
reading: not to waste time over secondary matters or subsidiary peo- 
ple, to occupy himself only with things of fundamental importance, 
those that shape secondary matters and second rate people without 
their participation. For example, outside his circle he made the ac- 
quaintance only of those people who had some influence over others. 
Someone who wasn't an authority for other people couldn't even enter 
into conversation with Rakhmetov. He would say, “You'll excuse me, 
but I don't have the time,” and would walk away. By the same token, 
no one could avoid becoming acquainted with Rakhmetov if the latter 
wanted it to happen. He simply appeared and declared what it was he 
required with the following prelude: “I wish to become acquainted 
with you. It’s essential. If this isn’t a good time, set another.” He paid 
no attention whatever to your petty concerns, even if you were his 
closest acquaintance and were begging him to become involved in 
your predicament. “I haven’t time,” he would say and turn aside. But 
he did get involved in important matters, when in his own opinion it 
was necessary, even though no one desired it. “I must,” he would say. 
The things he used to say and do on such occasions are beyond 
comprehension. 

Take, for instance, my own acquaintance with him.!9! By that time I 
was no longer so young, and had already lived for quite a while; 
therefore, some five or six young people from my province would 
occasionally gather at my place. Consequently, I was already some- 
thing of a valuable person for Rakhmetov; these young people were 
well disposed toward me, having discovered in me a similar disposi- 
tion toward them. It was in this way that he heard my name. When I 
saw him for the first time at Kirsanov’s, I still hadn’t heard much about 
him. It wasn’t long after his return to Petersburg from his wanderings. 
He arrived after I did. I was the only one present whom he didn’t 
know. As soon as he came in he took Kirsanov aside; glancing at me, 
Rakhmetov uttered a few words. Kirsanov answered him with equally 
few words and was then released. A minute later Rakhmetov sat down 
directly across from me, with only the small table near the sofa be- 
tween us; from a distance of some one and a half arshins!9? he began 
to stare at my face with all his might. I was annoyed. He examined me

without ceremony, as if I were a portrait and not a person. I frowned, 
but it made no difference to him. After staring at me for two or three 
minutes he said, “Mr. N., I must make your acquaintance. I know you, 
but you don’t know me. Ask our host about me or someone else here 
you trust.” He stood up and walked into another room. “Who is this 
character?” I asked. “That’s Rakhmetov. He wants you to ask me if he 
deserves your trust. He does, unquestionably; he deserves your atten- 
tion as well. He’s more important than all the rest of us here put 
together,” said Kirsanov, and the others confirmed it. Five minutes 
later he returned to the room where everyone was sitting. He didn't 
strike up a conversation with me and said very little to the others; the 
conversation was neither very significant nor scholarly. “Ah, it’s al- 
ready ten o'clock,” he said after a little while. “At ten I have business 
elsewhere. Mr. N.,” he said, turning to me, “I must have a few words 
with you. When I took our host aside to ask who you were, I looked at 
you, for I assumed you would in any case observe that I was inquiring 
about you. Consequently, it would have been foolish not to employ the 
gestures that naturally accompany such questions. When will you be 
at home so that I may call upon you?” 

At that time I didn’t desire any new acquaintances, nor did I appre- 
ciate his persistence. “I only sleep at home,” I said. “I’m never there 
during the day.” 

“But you do sleep at home? What time do you return home to go to 
sleep?” 

“Very late.” 

“For example?” 

“Two or three in the morning.” 

“Very well. Name the time.” 

“If you absolutely insist, then the day after tomorrow at three-thirty 
A.M.” 

“Of course I should take your words as derisive and rude; perhaps 
you have your reasons—even valid ones, at that. In any case, I shall be 
at your place at three-thirty a.m. the day after tomorrow.” 

“Well, if you're so determined, it would be better if you came later. I 
shall be at home all morning until twelve noon.” 

“Very well. I'll call in at ten o’clock. Will you be alone?” 

“Yes.” 

“Good.” 

He arrived and, with the same lack of circumlocution, came right to 
the reason for his wanting to make my acquaintance. We chatted for 
half an hour. It doesn’t matter what we discussed; suffice it to say that 
he argued, “You should,” and I replied, “No.” Then he said, “You 
must,” and I answered, “Not at all.” Half an hour later he declared, 


286 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Obviously it’s useless to continue. Are you at least convinced that I'm 
a person who deserves your absolute trust?” 

“Yes. Everyone said so and now! can see that for myself.” 

“Yet still you won’t budge?” 

“No.” 

“Do you know what follows from this? You're either a liar or a 
worthless fellow.” 

How do you like that? What action would have been required if 
someone else had uttered such words? Challenge him to a duel? But 
Rakhmetov spoke in a voice utterly devoid of personal emotion, as if he 
were a historian judging dispassionately, his intention not to offend, 
merely to arrive at the truth. He himself was so peculiar that it would 
have been absurd to take offense; I could only laugh. 

“Surely they're one and the same thing,” I said. 

“Not in this instance.” 

“Well then, perhaps I’m both.” 

“In this case that’s not possible. But you're one or the other for sure. 
Either what you say is different from what you think and do, in which 
case youre a liar, or you think and do exactly what you say, in which 
case you're a worthless fellow. One or the other for sure. I assume it’s 
the former.” 

“Think what you like,” I replied, still chuckling. 

“Good-bye,” he said. “In any case, you should know that I retain 
complete confidence in you and am ready to resume our conversation 
whenever you wish.” 

In spite of the strangeness of this episode, Rakhmetov was abso- 
lutely correct, both in the way he’d begun the conversation (since he’d 
inquired about me before he ever had) and in the way he’d concluded 
it. I really hadn't told him what I was thinking, and he’d really had the 
right to call me a liar. Furthermore, it couldn't be offensive, but was 
even flattering to me “in this instance,” as he’d said, because the 
instance was such that he really could retain complete confidence in 
me, perhaps even respect. 

Yes, however rude Rakhmetov's manners, everyone remained con- 
vinced that he acted as he did because it was the most sensible and 
simplest way to act. He would utter his harshest words and most 
horrible reproaches in such a way that no reasonable man could take 
offense. In spite of this phenomenal rudeness, he was basically a very 
tactful person. He always prefaced his comments in a particular way. 
He began each and every delicate explanation by saying, “You're aware 
that I speak without any personal emotion. If my words are unpleas- 
ant, I beg you to excuse them. I consider it inappropriate to take 
offense at anything said in earnest, especially when it’s uttered out of 


What Is to Be Done? 287 


necessity, with no intention to offend. Moreover, as soon as you con- 
sider it pointless to listen to my words, I'll stop. I have the following 
rule: I always offer my opinion when I should but never impose it on 
anyone.” 

And in fact he never did. It was absolutely impossible to save oneself 
from hearing his opinion when he considered it necessary, but he said 
only enough so that you could grasp what he wanted to say and how 
he planned to say it. He would do this in two or three words and then 
inquire, “Now you have some idea of my views on this matter. Would 
you find it useful to hold such a conversation?” If you said no, he’d 
turn aside and walk away. 

That's how he talked and conducted his business; he had a very 
great deal of it, none concerning him personally. He had no personal 
business: everyone knew that. But exactly what kind of business he did 
have, even our circle didn’t know. It was clear only that he had a 
multitude of concerns. He was rarely at home, always on the go, gener- 
ally on foot. But he was also constantly receiving people, either the 
same ones repeatedly or new ones altogether. Therefore he made it a 
rule always to be home between two and three P.M. It was at this time 
that he spoke about business and ate his dinner. Often he'd be away 
from home for several days in a row. Then one of his close friends, 
devoted to him body and soul and silent as the grave, would sit in his 
place and receive his guests. 

Two years after we see him sitting in Kirsanov's study reading New- 
ton’s Apocalypse, he left Petersburg, having informed Kirsanov and two 
or three others of his closest friends that he’d no further business 
there, that he’d done all he could, that only three years hence could 
something more be done, that he had these three years free and was 
planning to use them in a way best suited to his future activity.193 Later 
we learned that he'd returned to his former estate, sold all his remain- 
ing land, received some 35,000 rubles, and visited both Kazan and 
Moscow, where he distributed almost 5,000 rubles among the seven 
students he was supporting so that they might complete their various 
courses of study. 

This concludes the part of the story that’s verifiable. It's not known 
where he went after Moscow. When several months had passed with- 
out word of him, people who knew more about him than the rest 
ceased to hide the things he’d asked them not to talk about when he 
was living there among us. It was then that our circle learned about his

supporting those students and most of the rest of the things I've just 
told about his personal relations. We heard quite a few more stories, 
which by no means cleared things up; in fact, they didn’t clear any- 
thing up, but served only to make Rakhmetov an even more enigmatic 
figure to our entire circle. Some of these stories were astonishing in 
their peculiarity or else totally contradicted the impression that our 
circle had of him as a person completely impervious to personal emo- 
tion, possessing no personal heart, if I may use that expression, no 
heart throbbing with sensations of personal life. It would be inap- 
propriate to relate all these stories here. I'll include only two, one of 
each kind. The first is astonishingly strange; the second contradicts 
the previous conception of him held by our circle. I'm choosing from 
among those stories related by Kirsanov. 

About a year before he vanished from Petersburg for the second and 
probably last time, Rakhmetov said to Kirsanov, “Give me a rather large 
amount of ointment for curing wounds inflicted by a sharp instru- 
ment.” Kirsanov gave him a huge jar, assuming that Rakhmetov want- 
ed to deliver it to some artel of carpenters or other workmen subject to 
frequent lacerations.19* The next morning Rakhmetov’s landlady came 
running to fetch Kirsanov in great alarm: “Mr. Doctor, I don’t know 
what’s become of my tenant. He hasn’t come out of his room for some 
time. The door’s locked. I looked through the crack and saw him lying 
there covered with blood. I began yelling, but he called through the 
door, ‘It’s nothing, Agrafena Antonovna.’ What kind of nothing? Save 
him, Mr. Doctor, I fear for his life! He’s so hard on himself.’ 

Kirsanov ran off. Rakhmetov unlocked the door with a broad, grim 
smile and the visitor beheld a sight at which a person tougher than 
Agrafena Antonovna might have been aghast. The back and sides of 
Rakhmetov’s underclothes (that’s all he was wearing) were soaked in 
blood; there was blood under the bed; the felt on which he slept was 
also covered with blood; in the felt were hundreds of little nails, heads 
down and points up, sticking out almost half a vershok.1°5 Rakhmetov 
had been lying on them all night. “What on earth is this, Rakhmetov?” 
cried Kirsanov in horror. “A trial,” he replied. “It’s necessary. Improb- 
able, of course, but in any case necessary. Now I know I can do it.” 

Besides those things that Kirsanov saw, it was obvious that the

landlady could tell a great many more interesting stories about Rakh- 
metov; but she was a simple-hearted and simply attired old woman 
who doted on him. It was impossible to get anything more out of her. 
This particular time she'd come to fetch Kirsanov simply because 
Rakhmetov allowed her to do so in order to calm her down. She wept 
bitterly at the idea that Rakhmetov might have wanted to kill himself. 

About two months later, sometime at the end of May, Rakhmetov 
disappeared for a week or more, but no one noticed it then because he 
often dropped out of sight for a few days at a time. Now Kirsanov 
related the following story about how Rakhmetov had spent those few 
days. They constitute the “erotic episode” in Rakhmetov's life. Love 
grew out of an event worthy of Nikitushka Lomov. 

Rakhmetov was going from the village of Pargolovo to town,!¥6 lost in 
thought and staring at the ground as he usually did. Not far from the 
Forestry Institute he was roused from his reflections by the cry of a 
desperate woman. He looked up: a horse pulling a lady's carriage had 
bolted. The lady was driving and had lost control; the reins were being 
dragged along the ground. The horse was only about two paces from 
Rakhmetov. He leaped into the middle of the road, but the horse 
galloped past and he didn’t have time to seize the reins. He only 
managed to grab the rear axle. He brought the carriage to a halt and 
then fell down. A crowd ran over, helped the lady from the carriage, 
and lifted Rakhmetov up. His chest was somewhat bruised, but the 
main thing was that the wheel had torn a rather large piece of flesh 
from his leg. The lady had already recovered and ordered that he be 
carried to her dacha, only about half a verst away. He agreed because 
he felt so weak but demanded that they send for Kirsanov at once, and 
no other doctor. 

Kirsanov determined that the bruises on his chest were not too 
serious, but found that Rakhmetov was very weak from loss of blood. 
He had to remain there for ten days or so. Naturally the lady whom 
he'd rescued took care of him herself. He was so weak that he could do 
nothing at all; therefore he chatted with her. The time would have 
been lost in any case, so he talked and became quite involved in the 
conversation. The lady was a widow, only nineteen years old, moder- 
ately well off, fully independent, and an intelligent, decent woman. 
Rakhmetov's fiery speeches, not about love of course, fascinated her: “I 
see him in my dreams surrounded by a halo,” she said to Kirsanov.!97 


196. Pargolovo was then a popular hamlet for summer cottages (dachas) about six 
miles north of St. Petersburg; it now lies within the city limits of Leningrad. 

197. Another reference to the hagiographic origin of Rakhmetov's saintly character, 
rendered even more forcefully in the context of this novel by its revelation in a dream 
(see n. 159 above). 


290 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


He also fell in love with her. Judging by his clothes and everything else, 
she concluded that he was extremely poor; therefore, on the eleventh 
day of his confinement, when he got up and announced that he was 
ready to go home, it was she who first confessed her love and pro- 
posed marriage. 

“I've been more open with you than with most,” he said. “You must 
see that people like me have no right to bind their destiny to someone 
else’s.”198 

“Yes, that’s true,” she said. “You mustn't marry. But until it comes 
time for you to leave, you may still love me.” 

“No, I can’t do that,” he said. “I must suppress any love in myself: to 
love you would mean to bind my hands. Theyre already bound, and it 
will take me some time to untie them. But I'll manage. I must not love.” 

What became of this lady afterward? No doubt she experienced a 
great crisis in her own life; in all probability she too became an extraor- 
dinary person. I would like to know, but I don’t. Kirsanov didn’t tell me 
her name, nor did he know what had become of her. Rakhmetov asked 
him not to see the lady again and not to inquire about her. “If I 
supposed that you knew something about her, I'd never be able to 
resist asking about her. That would never do.” 

After learning about this incident, everyone recalled that for about a 
month or two, perhaps even longer, Rakhmetov was gloomier than 
usual. He didn’t get angry at himself no matter how much he was 
teased about his abominable weakness, that is, his cigars; nor did he 
smile broadly or sweetly when flattered by hearing his nickname, Niki- 
tushka Lomov. I remembered even more: three or four times during 
that summer, in conversations with me (sometime after our first chat 
he became fond of me because I teased him only when we were alone 
together), he answered my friendly jibes by saying, “Yes, do pity me. 
You're right. Pity me. For I too am not an abstract idea, but a human 
being, one who longs to live life. Never mind. It will pass,” he would 
add. And he was right—it did. Only once more, as late as that autumn, 
when I'd annoyed him by too much teasing, did he repeat those same 
words. 

Perhaps the perspicacious reader will guess from the above that I 
know more about Rakhmetov than I'm saying. Perhaps. I dare not 


198. Rakhmetov's abstinence from love finds its sources in the author's own theory of 
rational egoism and in his revolutionary fervor as well as in the religious traditions of 
early Christianity. In “The Anthropological Principle in Philosophy” (see n. 84 above), 
Chernyshevsky asserted that the egoist could rationally decide to eschew personal 
enjoyments and advantages in order to serve science or some other worthy cause. In the 
tale “Alferev,” also written during the author’s imprisonment in the Peter-Paul Fortress, 
the hero brings himself and his comrades to grief by falling in love with a woman who 
does not share his revolutionary views. 


What Is to Be Done? 291 


contradict him, because he’s so perspicacious. But even if I do, who's 
to tell how many more things I may know, about which you, O per- 
spicacious reader, will never find out so long as you live. Here's what I 
really don't know: I don’t know where Rakhmetov is now, what he’s 
doing, or whether I'll ever see him again. I have neither facts nor 
guesses, except for those that all his acquaintances share. When three 
or four months had passed after his disappearance from Moscow and 
no news about him had arrived, we all assumed that he’d left to travel 
around Europe. This guess seemed to be correct. At least it was con- 
firmed by the following circumstance. About a year after Rakhmetov 
disappeared, one of Kirsanov's acquaintances en route from Vienna to 
Munich met a young man in a railway carriage, a Russian, who said 
that he’d traveled throughout the Slavic countries. Everywhere he'd 
made friends with people of all classes; he’d remained in each country 
long enough to get to know their ideas, customs, way of life, local 
institutions, and the material well-being of the major sectors of its 
population. For this purpose he'd lived in cities and towns alike and 
traveled on foot from village to village. Then he’d moved on to become 
acquainted with the Romanians and Hungarians in precisely the same 
way. He traveled through northern Germany, and then headed south 
to the German parts of Austria. He was now on his way to Bavaria, from 
there to Switzerland, and by way of Wtirttemberg and Baden to France, 
which he planned to crisscross in the same way, and from there to 
England, always for the same purpose. He planned to spend about a 
year so occupied. If there was any time left, he’d visit the Spaniards 
and Italians; if not, then so be it, because that wasn't so “necessary,” 
while it was “necessary” to study the other countries. Why? “For vari- 
ous reasons.” In any case, in a year it would be “necessary” for him to 
be in the North American states, the study of which he considered 
more “necessary” than that of any other country. He would remain 
there a long time, perhaps over a year, perhaps forever, if he found 
appropriate pursuits. But it was much more likely that in three years 
or so he'd return to Russia because it seemed that there—not now, 
but then, in three or four years—it would be “necessary” for him to be 
in Russia.199 

All of this sounded very much like Rakhmetov, even all those “neces- 
saries” that had so impressed the narrator. The age, voice, and features 
of the traveler, insofar as the narrator could recall, also suggested that 
it was Rakhmetov. The narrator, however, had paid no special atten- 
tion to his fellow traveler; besides, they were together for a short time, 


199. Another prophecy of the impending revolution in Russia (see nn. 163 and 193 
above). 


292 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


only two hours or so. The Russian had boarded the train in some small 
town and disembarked at some little village. 

As a result, the narrator could describe the traveler’s appearance 
only in very general terms. Absolute certainty was impossible, but in 
all probability it was Rakhmetov. On the other hand, who knows? 
Perhaps not. 

There was anotherrumor circulating that a young Russian, a former 
landowner, had appeared before one of the greatest European think- 
ers of the rineteenth century, the father of modern philosophy, a 
German,2° and had declared, “I have thirty thousand thalers, of which 
I need only five thousand.2° I beg you to accept the rest.” (This phi- 
losopher was then living in great poverty.) 

“What on earth for?” he asked. 

“To publish your works” was the reply. 

Of course, the philosopher didn’t accept the money. All the same, it 
seems that this Russian deposited the money in a bank under the 
philosopher's name, and then wrote a note to him as follows: “You 
may dispose of the money as you wish, even by throwing it into the 
water. You won’t be able to return it to me because you'll never find 
me.” Apparently the money is still in that bank. If this rumor is correct, 
then there's no doubt whatever that it was none other than Rakhmetov 
who'd appeared before that philosopher. 

That's the sort of person who's now sitting in Kirsanov’s study. 

Yes, he was an extraordinary man, a specimen ofa very rare breed. I 
haven't described a specimen of this breed in such detail merely in 
order to instruct you, O perspicacious reader, in the appropriate way 
(unknown to you) to treat such people. You'll never get to see even one 
example of this breed. Your eyes, O perspicacious reader, aren't con- 
stituted so that you can perceive such types. Theyre invisible to you. 
Only honest and bold eyes can see them. This description serves 
merely so that you'll know, even if only by hearsay, what kind of 
people exist on this earth. As for what purpose this description serves 
the female reader and the common reader, well, they themselves 
know. 

Yes, people like Rakhmetov are funny, very amusing indeed. I say 
that for their own benefit, because I feel sorry for them. I say it to those 
noble people who are so fascinated by them: “Don't follow their exam- 
ple, O noble people,” I say, “because the path to which they summon 
you leads to no personal joys.” But the noble people don't listen to me. 
They reply, “No, it’s not barren, it’s rich—and even if barren here and 


200. Feuerbach (see n. 41 above). 
201. The German thaler was worth three marks. 


What Is to Be Done? 293 


there, still it doesn't take long to get past those places; we'll have the 
strength to reach other places that are rich in endless joy.” 

So you see, O perspicacious reader, it isn't to you but to another part 
of the public that I admit that people like Rakhmetov are funny. To 
you, O perspicacious reader, I shall say that these people aren't bad 
people. Otherwise, you might not understand that for yourself. Yes, 
they're not bad people. There are only a few of them, but through 
them everyone’s life will flourish. Without them life would wither and 
go sour. There are only a few of them, but they make it possible for all 
people to breathe; without them people would suffocate. There’s a 
great mass of honest and good people, but there are very few people 
like them. But these few people are within that mass, as theine is in 
tea, as bouquet is in fine wine. They are its strength and its aroma. 
They are the flower of the best people, the movers of the movers, the 
salt of the salt of the earth.2o2 


XXX. 


“Well,” thinks the perspicacious reader, “from now on the main 
character of this novel will be Rakhmetov. He'll outshine all the others. 
Vera Pavlovna will fall in love with him, and so, very soon, the exact 
same thing that happened to Lopukhov will happen to Kirsanov.” 

Nothing of the kind will happen, my perspicacious reader! Rakhme- 
tov will spend the evening there and have a good chat with Vera 
Pavlovna. I shall not conceal one word of their conversation from you. 
You'll soon see that if I didn’t want to share it with you, it would have 
been very easy for me to keep it to myself; the course of the action of 
my story would in no way be changed by its omission. Well in advance 
I'll tell you that after he’s finished his little chat with Vera Pavlovna, 
Rakhmetov will take his leave; with that, he'll also take his leave from 
my narrative. He'll play neither a principal role nor a secondary one, 
nor any role at all in the rest of my novel.2°3 But why then was he 
introduced and described in such detail? Well, my perspicacious 
reader, wouldn't you like to guess the reason? You'll be told why a few 
pages hence, following the conversation between Rakhmetov and Vera

political events because of his own incarceration. In any case, to underscore the differ- 
ence between appearance, interpretation, and reality, Chernyshevsky provides the read-

will come to pass.

Pavlovna. As soon as he takes his leave, I'll explain it all to you at the 
end of this chapter. You may want to guess now what you'll be told 
then. It’s not hard to guess if you've even the least notion of art, about 
which you so love to blather. But how could you guess? Well, I'll 
prompt you with more than half the answer: Rakhmetov has been 
introduced to fulfill the principal, most fundamental requirement of 
art, and exclusively to satisfy it. Well, well, can you guess now? At least 
you can guess what this requirement is, what was needed to satisfy it, 
and how it was satisfied by the introduction of Rakhmetov, even 
though he has no influence or importance in the rest of the story. 
Come now, guess! My female reader and the common reader who 
doesn’t go on at length about art already know the answer. But you, 
my wise male reader, you too must try to guess! You can have as much 
time as you need; for that purpose I'll put a long, thick black line 
between sections. See what good care I take of you? Pause over it and 
reflect as to whether you will or won't be able to guess the answer. 


Natasha Mertsalova arrived, shared Vera Pavlovna’s grief, expressed 
sympathy, and then said that she’d gladly take charge of the work- 
shop, even though she didn’t know whether she could manage it. She 
grieved and sympathized again, and then began to help sort out the 
clothes. After asking the neighbors’ maid to run to the bakery, Rakhme- 
tov set up the samovar, made the tea, and served it. They all had tea. 
For about half an hour Rakhmetov sat with the ladies; he consumed 
five glasses of tea. He helped them empty half a huge pitcher of cream 
and consumed an enormous pile of biscuits, in addition to two plain 
rolls that served as the foundation for the rest. “I have a right to this 
delight because I'm sacrificing twelve hours of my time.” 

And so he indulged for a while and listened to the way the ladies 
were mourning; three times he expressed the opinion that it was 
“madness” to do it—that is, not to mourn, but to take one’s own life for 
whatever reason (except as a result of a very painful and incurable 
physical ailment, or to avoid some painful and inevitable death, tor- 
ture on the rack, for instance). Each time he expressed this opinion ina 
few strong words, as was his custom. He poured himself a sixth glass 
of tea, emptied the remaining cream into it, and took the rest of the 
biscuits (the ladies had finished their tea some time before). Then he 
bowed; armed with these supplies for the grand finale of his material 
delight, he retired to the study, where he spent some time as a syb- 
arite, reclining on a sofa—a very common kind of sofa for anyone else, 
but one that for him was something of a Capuan luxury.2% “I have a

right to such a feast because I'm sacrificing twelve to fourteen hours of 
my time.” 

After finishing his material delight, he resumed the spiritual one, 
that is, reading Newton’s commentary on the Apocalypse. About nine 
o'clock a police officer arrived to inform the suicide’s wife about the 
particulars of the affair, which by now were already crystal clear. Rakh- 
metov said that the wife already knew and there was no point in 
talking to her. The officer was very glad to be spared such a harrowing 
scene. Then Masha and Rachel arrived to begin sorting clothes and 
goods. Rachel found that for everything, except the good fur coat 
(which she advised her not to sell because in three months or so she'd 
only have to get a new one, and Vera Pavlovna agreed), for everything 
else she could pay 450 rubles. It was Mertsalova’s inner conviction that 
this was a fair price. So by ten o'clock or so the commercial transaction 
had been completed. Rachel handed over 200 rubles (she didn’t have 
any more cash with her) and said she’d send the rest with Mertsalova 
in two or three days. Then she collected her goods and left. Mertsalova 
stayed on for another hour, but she had to go home to feed her baby. 
She left, saying that she would come back tomorrow to accompany 
Vera Pavlovna to the railway station. 

After Natasha Mertsalova had gone, Rakhmetov closed Newton’s 
Commentary on the Apocalypse, put it carefully back on the shelf 
where it belonged, and sent Masha to ask Vera Pavlovna if he could see 
her. He could. He entered with his usual cool, unhurried manner. 

“Vera Pavlovna, I'm now able to offer you a considerable degree of 
consolation. Earlier it was inappropriate; but now I can. First I must 
inform you that the general outcome of my visit will be consoling. You 
know that I don’t waste words; therefore you should be calm in ad- 
vance. I shall unfold the matter to you in its proper sequence. I told 
you that I'd seen Alexander Matveich and that I knew everything. 
That’s really true. I actually have seen Alexander Matveich and I really 
do know everything. But I didn’t say that I know everything from him; 
nor could I have said that, because actually I know everything not from 
him but from Dmitry Sergeich, who spent about two hours with me. 
I'd been notified that he was coming and therefore was at home to 
receive him. He spent two hours or even more with me after he wrote 
you that note which has caused you so much grief. It was he who 
asked me to...” 

“You knew what he was planning to do, yet you didn’t stop him?” 

“I asked you to be calm because the general outcome of my visit will 
be consoling. I didn’t stop him because his decision was well founded, 
as you'll soon see for yourself. As I was saying, it was he who asked me 
to spend this evening with you; knowing that you would be in mourn- 
ing, he entrusted me with a commission. He chose me as his inter- 


296 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


mediary because he knew me to be a man who, once he’s accepted a 
commission, will carry it out with absolute precision, and who cannot 
be deflected from its exact execution by any emotion or entreaties. He 
foresaw that you would beg me to violate his wishes, yet he trusted 
that I wouldn't be moved by your entreaties and would carry out his 
commission. I shall do so. Therefore, I ask you in advance, do not 
request any concessions from me. His commission was as follows: In 
taking his leave and preparing to ‘quit the scene,’ he .. .” 

“My God! What has he done? Why didn’t you stop him?” 

“Try to understand the meaning of the phrase ‘quit the scene,’ and 
don't condemn me prematurely. He did use that phrase in the note 
you received, isn’t that right? And we'll use precisely that same phrase 
because it’s extremely accurate and very well chosen.” 

Vera Pavlovna’s eyes began to display some confusion. More and 
more she realized, “I don’t know what he means. What am I supposed 
to think?” Oh, that Rakhmetov, with all the apparent absurdity of his 
circumstantial method of explanation, was a master, a grand master in 
managing this affair. He was a superb psychologist who knewvery well 
the laws of gradual preparation and could carry them out. 

“And so, in taking his leave, according to his own very accurate 
expression, to ‘quit the scene,’ he left me a note for you... .” 

Vera Pavlovna jumped up. 

“Where is it? Give it to me! And you could sit here all day and not 
give it to me?” 

“Yes, I could because I saw the need to do so. Soon you'll be able to 
appreciate my reasons. They are well founded. First of all, I must 
explain the expression I used at the very beginning, namely, ‘the gen- 
eral outcome will be consoling.’ By ‘consoling’ I didn’t mean the mere 
receipt of this note, for two reasons: first, receipt of the note in and of 
itself wouldn't be sufficient to deserve the name consolation, correct? 
Consolation requires something more. Therefore, the consolation 
must reside in the actual content of the note.” 

Vera Pavlovna jumped up again. 

“Calm down. I can't say that you're wrong. Having warned you about 
the content of the note, I ask that you listen to the second reason for 
my Stating that receipt of the note in and of itself won’t be sufficient 
consolation, and that I am referring to its content. The content of the 
note, the nature of which we've just determined, is so important that I 
can only show it to you, and can't give it to you. You'll read it, but you 
can’t have it to keep.’ : 

“What? You won't give it to me?” 

“No. That’s precisely why I was chosen. Anyone else in my place 
would give you the note. It cannot remain in your possession because, 


What Is to Be Done? 297 


by virtue of the extreme importance of its contents, the nature of 
which we've just determined, it cannot remain in anyone's possession. 
If I gave it to you, you'd want to keep it. Therefore, so as not to have to 
resort to force in order to take it away from you, I won't give it to you in 
the first place; I'll merely show it to you. However, I shall do so only 
when you're seated with your hands folded on your knees, and only 
after you've given me your word that you won't raise your hands.” 

If an onlooker had been present, no matter how sensitive his heart, 
he couldn't have refrained from laughing at the solemnity of this entire 
procedure, in particular at the ritual ceremoniousness of this finale. It 
was undoubtedly ridiculous. But how good it would be for our nerves 
if, in the communication of such important news, a person were able 
to maintain even a tenth of Rakhmetov's restraint during the prepara- 
tion. 

But Vera Pavlovna, not being an onlooker, could of course experi- 
ence only the excruciating aspect of his slow pace. She herself ap- 
peared as a figure no less capable of amusing our observer as she 
quickly sat down, obediently folded her hands, and exclaimed in a 
most amusing voice (that is, with painful impatience), “I swear!” 

Rakhmetov placed on the table a sheet of writing paper on which 
some ten or twelve lines were written. 

Scarcely had Vera Pavlovna cast one glance at it when, at that very 
same instant, flushing and forgetting all her oaths, she jumped up. 
Like a flash of lightning her hand tried to grab the note, but it was 
already far, far away, in Rakhmetov’s uplifted hand. 

“I expected that; therefore, as you might have noticed, I never even 
let go of the note. In precisely the same way I'll continue to hold this 
page by the corner the whole time it will lie here on the table. Conse- 
quently, all your efforts to grab the note will be in vain.” 

Once again Vera Pavlovna sat down and folded her hands. Once 
again Rakhmetov placed the note before her eyes. She read it through 
with considerable agitation some twenty times. Rakhmetov stood next 
to her chair very patiently and kept his hand on the corner of the 
paper. About a quarter of an hour passed in this way. Finally Vera 
Pavlovna raised her hand very gently, obviously with no acquisitive 
intentions; she covered her eyes and said, “How kind he is, how very 
kind.” 

“I don’t completely share your opinion and will explain why not. 
That will not be part of my commission, merely the statement of my 
own view, which I also expressed to him at our last meeting. His 
commission consisted merely in showing you this note and then 
burning it. Have you seen it long enough?” 

“No, more, more.” 


298 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


She folded her hands again, and again he showed her the note, 
standing there for another good quarter of an hour with the same 
patience as before. Again she covered her face with her hands and 
affirmed, “Oh, he's so kind, so very kind.” 

“You've studied this note as much as you possibly could. If you'd 
been in a calmer state of mind, by now you would have memorized 
not only its contents but the form of every single letter—since you've 
stared at it so attentively for so long. But in your current agitation all 
laws governing memory are invalidated, and your memory can betray 
you. Foreseeing this possibility, I have made a copy of the text; when- 
ever you wish, you may see this copy at my house. After a certain 
period of time I'll probably be able to give you that copy. For now, I 
assume that I can burn the original, and then my commission will 
have been fulfilled.” 

“Show it to me once more.” 

He placed the note on the table again. This time Vera Pavlovna read 
it and continually lifted her gaze from the paper; obviously she was 
learning the text by heart and checking to see whether she'd memo- 
rized its contents. In a few minutes she sighed and no longer raised 
her eyes from it. 

“Now I can see that you've had long enough. It's time. It’s already 
midnight and I'd still like to express my views on this matter because I 
consider it useful for you to hear them. Do you agree?” 

“Yes.” 

At that very instant the note was consumed by the candle flame. 

“Oh!” cried Vera Pavlovna. “I didn’t mean that! Why did you?” 

“Yes, you merely said that you'd agreed to listen to me. But it’s all 
the same now. Sooner or later I had to burn it.” Having said this, 
Rakhmetov sat down. “Besides, there's still my copy of the note. Now, 
Vera Pavlovna, I'll express to you my opinion on this matter. I'll begin 
with you. You're leaving. Why?” 

“I would find it very painful to remain here. The sight of places that 
would remind me of the past would upset me.” 

“Yes, that feeling is unpleasant. But would it really be that much 
easier in any other place? Not very much. Besides, what are you really 
doing? To seek some slight relief you've abandoned to the mercy of 
fate some fifty people whose lives depend on you. Is that right?” 

Gone was Rakhmetov's solemn, boring manner! Now his voice was 
lively, natural, simple, direct, and animated. 

“Yes, but I was going to ask Natasha Mertsalova to replace me.” 

“That's not the same. You don't know whether she'd be capable of 
replacing you in the workshop. Her suitability has never been tested. 
The position requires rather rare ability. I'll bet ten to one that there's 


What Is to Be Done? 299 


really no one to replace you and that your departure would destroy 
the whole enterprise. Is that fair? You'd be subjecting the well-being of 
some fifty people to almost certain, inevitable ruin. And for what? For 
some small personal convenience! Is that right? What tender solici- 
tude to your own insignificant comfort, yet what indifference to the 
fate of others! How do yeu like this view of the whole affair?” 

“Why didn’t you try to stop me?” 

“You wouldn't have listened to me. Besides, I knew you'd return 
soon and it would all come to nothing. How do you plead? Guilty?” 

“All the way,” said Vera Pavlovna, half in jest, but half (even more 
than half) in earnest. 

“No, that’s still only part of the way. All the way involves a great deal 
more. But first you'll receive a reward for your repentance: assistance 
in correcting your other fault. Are you quite calm now, Vera Pavlovna?” 

“Yes, almost.” 

“Good. Do you think Masha is asleep? Do you still need her for 
anything?” 

“Of course not.” 

“But you're already quite calm. You really ought to have told her to 
go to sleep. It’s after midnight and she gets up very early. Who was 
supposed to remember that, you or I? I'll tell her to go to sleep. And 
here again, for your new repentance (since you're obviously repenting), 
there'll come another reward. I'll see what's left to eat in the kitchen. 
You haven't had any dinner today; I suspect that by now your appetite 
has returned.” 

“Yes, it has. Actually, now that you mention it, I can see that I’m very 
hungry indeed,” said Vera Pavlovna, laughing aloud. 

Rakhmetov brought in some cold leftovers from dinner. Masha had 
shown him where to find some cheese and a jar of mushrooms. The 
snack proved to be very tasty. He also brought in two place settings, 
doing everything himself. 

“You see, Rakhmetov, the gusto with which I'm eating! It must mean 
that I was hungry. Yet I didn’t realize it myself. Clearly I'd forgotten not 
only about Masha but about myself too. That must mean I'm not such 
a malicious criminal after all.” 

“Nor was it because I’m such a paradigm of solicitude for others that 
I reminded you about your appetite. I had a poor dinner myself and 
was hungry. Actually, I ate what another person would have con- 
sidered enough for a dinner and a half—but you know how much I 
eat—enough for two strapping peasants.” 

“Oh, Rakhmetov, you're my guardian angel, and not only because of 
my appetite. But why did you sit here all day and not show me that 
note? Why did you torture me for so long?” 


300 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“I had a good reason. It was essential for other people to see how 
upset you were so that word of your terrible state would spread and 
confirm the incident that so distressed you. Surely you wouldn't have 
wanted to feign sorrow! And it’s impossible to replace true emotion 
entirely; the real thing always appears much more convincing. Now 
there are three sources of confirmation: Masha, Mertsalova, and Ra- 
chel. Mertsalova is particularly important, since she’s not a member of 
your immediate circle. I was very glad that you decided to send for 
her.” 

“You're so very shrewd, Rakhmetov.” 

“Yes. It wasn't a bad idea to wait till night time, either. But that 
wasn’t my doing—it was Dmitry Sergeich who thought of that.” 

“He's so kind!” said Vera Pavlovna with a sigh; but the truth is that 
she sighed not out of sorrow but only out of thankfulness. 

“Hey, Vera Pavlovna, we'll talk about him later. He’s been thinking 
clearly and behaving admirably lately. But we'll also find some faults in 
him, even some major ones.” 

“Rakhmetov, don’t you dare talk about him like that. Do you hear? 
I'll get very angry.” 

“Are you rebelling? You'll be punished for that. Shall I carry on? The 
list of your crimes has only just begun.” 

“Punish on, punish on, Rakhmetov.” 

“First you get a reward for submitting. Submission is always re- 
warded. You must have a bottle of wine around here somewhere. You 
could use a drink. Where might I find it? In the sideboard or the 
cupboard?” 

“The sideboard.” 

There he found a bottle of sherry. Rakhmetov urged Vera Pavlovna to 
drink two glasses, while he lit up a cigar. 

“What a pity that I can’t have three or four glasses myself. I'd like to.” 

“Would you really, Rakhmetov?” 

“I’m envious, Vera Pavlovna, very envious,” he said with a laugh. 
“The flesh is weak.” 

“You! Weak! Thank God! But you astonish me, Rakhmetov. You're not 
at all what you seem to be. Why do you always appear to be such a 
gloomy monster? And why are you such a nice, agreeable fellow now?” 

“Vera Pavlovna, I’m carrying out an agreeable obligation. Why 
shouldn't I be agreeable, too? But this is a rare occasion. In general one 
sees such disagreeable things; how can one help being a gloomy mon- 
ster? Only now, Vera Pavlovna, that you've had the chance to see me in 
a mood that I'd like to be in all the time, and since we've been so open 
with one another, let it remain our secret that I'm really not a gloomy 


What Is to Be Done? 301 


monster because I enjoy it. It'll be easier for me to fulfill my obligations 
if others don't notice that I'd like not only to do that, but also to enjoy 
life. Now people don't try to distract me or take up my time by forcing 
me to refuse their invitations. And now, so that you can more easily 
conceive of me as a gloomy monster, we must continue our investiga- 
tion of your crimes.” 

“What more do you want? You've already discovered two: neglect of 
Masha and the workshop. I’ve repented of both.” 

“Neglect of Masha is merely a misdemeanor, not a crime. Masha 
didn’t perish because she had to rub her sleepy eyes one hour longer. 
On the contrary, she did it with the pleasant feeling that she was 
carrying out her duties. But for neglect of the workshop I really do 
want to take you to task.” 

“But you've already done so.” 

“Not completely. I want to finish the job. How could you possibly 
leave the workshop to its ruin?” 

“But I’ve already repented. Besides, I wasn’t going to abandon it 
completely: Mertsalova had agreed to replace me.” 

“We've already said that your intention to be replaced by her is not a 
good excuse. By using it you have pleaded guilty to a new crime.” 
Rakhmetov was gradually assuming a very serious tone again, though 
not a gloomy one. “You say that she’s replacing you. Has that been 
decided?” 

“Yes,” said Vera Pavlovna, without her previous jocular tone, sensing 
that something bad was about to follow. 

“Now see here. It's been decided ... by whom? By you and her? 
Without any inquiry as to whether those fifty people would agree to 
the change, whether they might prefer something else or find some- 
thing better. Why, that’s despotism, Vera Pavlovna! So you've commit- 
ted two major crimes: callousness and despotism. But the third is even 
more serious. An institution that more or less corresponds to very 
sound ideas about the organization of daily life, that serves more or 
less as a significant confirmation of their practicality (there are still so 
few practical proofs and each one is still so precious)—this same 
institution you were subjecting to the threat of destruction. You could 
have transformed it from a demonstration of practicality to proof of 
inapplicability, of the absurdity of your convictions, a means for reject- 
ing a set of ideas beneficial for all humanity. You would have provided 
the defenders of darkness and evil with an argument against your own 
sacred principles. I’m not even talking about the fact that you might 
have destroyed the well-being of some fifty people. What do fifty peo- 
ple matter? You could have harmed the cause of all mankind and 


302 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


betrayed the idea of progress! That, Vera Pavlovna, in ecclesiastical 
language is called a sin against the Holy Spirit.2% It’s said that a person 
can be forgiven any other sin but that. Is it true? How do you plead? 
How fortunate that everything turned out as it did, and that these sins 
were committed only in your imagination. I see that you're really 
blushing now, Vera Pavlovna. Good, I'll provide you with some con- 
solation. If you hadn’t suffered so much, you’d never have committed 
such criminal offenses, even in your own imagination. That means 
that the real offender in all this is the person who brought about your 
distress. Yet you keep repeating, “He's so kind, so very kind.” 

“What? Then in your opinion he’s the one responsible for my suffer- 
ing?” 

“Who else? And this whole affair—he managed it very well, I'm not 
arguing about that—why did it happen? Why all this fuss? It should 
never even have happened.” 

“Yes, I shouldn't ever have had that feeling. But I didn’t ask for it. I 
even tried to suppress it.” 

“You shouldn't have had that feeling! You were blind to the true 
source of your guilt, yet you still blame yourself for something you 
didn't do. This feeling had to arise sooner or later, given your nature 
and that of Dmitry Sergiech. One way or another it would have devel- 
oped. Here the fundamental feeling was not that you fell in love with 
another man: that's merely the consequence. The fundamental feeling 
was dissatisfaction with your previous relationship. What form should 
this dissatisfaction have taken? If you and he both, or even just one of 
you, had been less developed, less refined, or just bad people, then 
this feeling would probably have followed its customary form: hostility 
between husband and wife. You would have fought with each other if 
both of you were bad, or else one of you would have carped and the 
other would have been tormented. In any case, it would have been one 
of those domestic hells we have the chance to admire in such a large 
majority of couples. Of course, it would in no way have interfered with 
the emergence of your love for another person; but the main thing in 
such a case would have been the hell itself, the incessant carping at 
each other. Your dissatisfaction couldn't take this form because you're 
both decent people; therefore it developed into its mildest, gentlest, 
least offensive form—love for another person. So there’s no point in 
talking about that love for another person—it's not the crux of the 
matter. The main point is your dissatisfaction with your previous posi- 
tion; the reason for that dissatisfaction was the incompatibility of your 


205. Once again Chernyshevsky equates social revolution with the realization of God's 
kingdom on earth. 


What Is to Be Done? 303 


two natures. You're both good people, but when your character ma- 
tured, Vera Pavlovna, when you lost your childish indecisiveness and 
acquired definite traits, it turned out that you and Dmitry Sergeich 
were not well suited to each other. Is there anything reprehensible in 
either of you? Take me, for example. I too am a good person. Could 
you bear to live with me? You’d hang yourself in despair after how 
many days?” 

“After only a very few days,” said Vera Pavlovna laughing. 

“He’s not so gloomy a monster as I am; still, you and he are too 
mismatched. Who should have been the first to notice this fact? Who 
was older? Whose character was formed sooner? Who had more life 
experience? Why, he should have foreseen it and prepared you so that 
you wouldn't get frightened and wouldn't have to grieve. But he real- 
ized this only afterward, when the feeling he should have anticipated, 
but did not, had not only developed in full but even produced another 
one. Why didn't he foresee it and notice it? Was he stupid, or what? He 
was smart enough. No, he neglected his relationship with you, Vera 
Pavlovna. It was a result of his inattention and negligence, that’s what! 
While you keep on saying, ‘How kind he is! How he loves me!” Rakh- 
metov had gradually became more animated. Although he was now 
speaking with considerable feeling, Vera Pavlovna still managed to 
interrupt him. 

“I don’t have to listen to you, Rakhmetov,” she said in a tone of 
extreme dissatisfaction. “You're pouring abuse on a man to whom I am 
eternally grateful.” 

“No, Vera Pavlovna, if you didn’t have to listen to me, I would never 
have started speaking. Do you think I realized all this only today? 
That I could say it all if I'd only just noticed it? You know it’s impossi- 
ble to avoid talking to me, if I consider a conversation necessary. In 
other words, I could have told you all this sooner, but I chose to keep 
silent, didn't I? It also means that if I've now begun to speak to you, it’s 
necessary for me to do so. I say nothing before it’s necessary. You 
know that I kept that note in my pocket for a full nine hours, even 
though I found it painful to look at you. But it was necessary for me to 
keep silent, so I did so. Consequently, if I now say that for some time 
I’ve been thinking about Dmitry Sergeich’s relationship with you, then 
it's necessary for me to speak about it.” 

“No, I don’t want to listen,” said Vera Pavlovna in extreme agitation. 
“Task you to be still, Rakhmetov. I want you to leave. I’m very grateful 
to you for having wasted a whole evening on my account, but now I 
ask you to leave.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Very sure.” 


304 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Fine,” he said laughing. “No, ma’am. You won't get away from me 
that easily, Vera Pavlovna. I foresaw this possibility and took appropri- 
ate precautions. The note that I burned he wrote on his own. But this 
one he wrote at my request. I can leave it with you because it’s not an 
official document. Here it is.” Rakhmetov handed another note to Vera 
Pavlovna: “July 11. 2 a.m. My dear friend Verochka. Listen to everything 
that Rakhmetov has to say. I don’t know what he wants to tell you. I 
haven't asked him to say anything, and he hasn't given me any indica- 
tion of what he wants to say. But I know that he never says anything 
unnecessary. Yours, D. L.” 

God knows how many times Vera Pavlovna kissed this note! 

“Why didn’t you give it to me sooner? Perhaps you have something 
else from him?” 

“No, nothing else, since nothing else was necessary. Why didn't I 
give it to you sooner? As long as there was no need, I didn't find it 
necessary.” 

“Good Lord, what do you mean there was no need? To give me the 
pleasure of having a few lines from him written after we parted!” 

“Well, if it was only for that reason, it wasn’t so important,” he said 
with a smile. 

“Ah, Rakhmetov, you want to drive me crazy!” 

“So now will this note cause a new quarrel between us?” he asked, 
laughing again. “If that’s the case, then I'll take it and burn it. You know 
it’s said that people of our kind hold nothing sacred. We're capable of 
any violence and villainy. Now may I continue?” 

They both were calmer now, she from receiving the note and he 
from sitting in silence for a few moments while she was kissing it. 

“Yes, I am obliged to listen.” 

“He didn’t notice what he should have noticed,” began Rakhmetov 
in a serene tone, “and that’s produced unfortunate consequences. But 
while we can’t really blame him for something he didn’t notice, we 
can’t exonerate him either. Let’s suppose that he didn’t know all this 
would inevitably arise from the nature of the relations between your 
character and his; nevertheless, he should have prepared you for 
something of the sort, simply as a contingency, an undesirable, unex- 
pected one, but one that could arise nonetheless. No one can vouch 
for the future; all things are possible. Surely he was already familiar 
with the axiom that says al: things are possible. How did he leave you 
in such a state that when all this occurred you were so completely 
unprepared? The fact that he didn’t foresee it resulted from his negli- 
gence and was harmful to you; in and of itself that fact is of little 
consequence, neither bad nor good. But the fact that he didn’t prepare 
you for any contingency resulted from a very bad motive. Of course he 


What Is to Be Done? 305 


was acting unconsciously, but man’s nature is revealed in those very 
acts. It would have gone against his own interests to prepare you, 
since any preparation would have weakened your resistance to a feel- 
ing not in accord with his own interests. You experienced such a 
powerful emotion that your own resistance was useless; but once 
again it was pure chance that the emotion arose with such strength. If 
it had been inspired by a less deserving man, though still a worthy 
one, it would have been less powerful. Feelings so strong that it’s 
useless to struggle against them are rare exceptions. There's a much 
greater chance for the appearance of the kind of feelings that can be 
overcome if the will to resist hasn't been totally weakened. It was 
precisely for this more likely possibility that he didn't want to weaken 
it. That's the reason he left you unprepared and subjected you to such 
suffering. What do you think about that?” 

“It’s not true, Rakhmetov. He didn't conceal his way of thinking from 
me. His convictions were as well known to me as they are to you.” 

“Of course, Vera Pavlovna. Concealing them would have been too 
much! To interfere with the development of those convictions that 
would have corresponded to his own, to pretend to think something 
other than what he really thought—that would have been downright 
dishonorable. You would never have fallen in love with such a man! 
Have I ever called him a bad person? He’s a very good man; how could 
he be otherwise? Ill praise him as much as you like. I’m merely saying 
that before this whole matter arose—once it did, he behaved admira- 
bly—but before it arose, he behaved badly. Why did you have to tor- 
ment yourself? He said—though he didn’t have to say anything since 
it was so obvious—that you did it so as not to hurt him. How could the 
idea that this would hurt him have occurred to you and stayed with 
you? It shouldn't have. How can one talk of hurt in this case? Why, it's 
absurd! Jealousy! Imagine!” 

“Don’t you recognize jealousy, Rakhmetov?” 

“It shouldn't exist in a developed person. It's a distorted emotion, a 
false feeling, a despicable one, an outcome of the sort of thing that 
would make me refuse to let anyone wear my underclothes or use my 
cigar holder. It’s the result of regarding a person as my own property, 
as an inanimate object.” 

“But, Rakhmetov, if you don’t recognize jealousy, that leads to terri- 
ble consequences.” 

“For a person who feels it, the consequences are terrible; for a per- 
son who doesn’t, there's nothing terrible about it at all, or even impor- 
tant.” 

“But you're advocating total immorality, Rakhmetov.” 

“Is that what you think after living with him for four years? It’s 


306 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


precisely in this respect that he’s guilty. How many times a day do you 
have dinner? Once. Would anyone object if you had dinner twice a 
day? Probably not. Why don’t you do it? Are you afraid of hurting 
someone, perhaps? Probably it’s simply because it's unnecessary, or 
that you don't feel like it. Yet dinner is a very pleasant thing. But your 
reason—even more, your appetite—says that one dinner is pleasant, 
but not a second. But if you conceived the fantasy or the morbid whim 
to dine twice a day, would the fear of hurting someone deter you? No. 
If someone were offended by it or were to forbid it, you would merely 
conceal it. You would eat your food secretively—soiling your hands by 
grabbing it too quickly and your clothes by hiding it in your pockets— 
but that’s all. There’d be no question of morality or immorality, only 
whether contraband is a good thing. Who's deterred by the thought 
that jealousy is a feeling worthy of respect and pity? Who says to 
himself, ‘Oh, if I do this, I'll hurt someone! Whom would this cause to 
suffer needlessly in a struggle? Only a few, the noblest ones, whose 
nature (have no fear) will never lead them into immorality. This non- 
sense won't deter the rest, but will merely force them to resort to 
schemes and deception, that is, to become really bad. That's all there 
is to it. Didn’t you know all of this?” 

“Of course I did.” 

“Well then, where are you going to find the moral worth of jealou- 
sy?” 

“But he and I always spoke in the same vein.” 

“Probably not quite in the same vein; perhaps you said these words, 
but you didn’t believe each other when you heard them. And you 
didn’t believe them, of course, because you constantly heard them 
applied to all sorts of different subjects; perhaps they were even ap- 
plied to this very subject but in a different vein. Otherwise, how could 
you have suffered for God knows how long? And what on earth for? 
Such torment over mere trifles! What distress for all three people, 
especially for you, Vera Pavlovna! Meanwhile, all three of you could 
have lived very calmly as you did the year before. You could have 
moved into one apartment or made some other arrangement, what- 
ever, without causing any distress at all. You could have continued to 
have tea, the three of you together, and go to the opera together just as 
you did before. Why all this suffering? Why these crises? It's all be- 
cause, thanks to his previous poor method of keeping you unprepared 
for such an eventuality, you persisted in thinking, ‘I'm killing him’— 
which wouldn't have been true at all. Yes, he caused you a great deal 
of unnecessary grief.” 

“No, Rakhmetov. You say such horrible things.” 

“Horrible things’ again! So far as I’m concerned, here's what's really 
horrible: torment over trifles and crises over nonsense.” 


What Is to Be Done? 307 


“So in your opinion our entire story is no more than a stupid melo- 
drama?’ 

“Yes, an entirely unnecessary melodrama mixed with entirely un- 
necessary tragedy. And Dmitry Sergeich is to blame for the fact that 
instead of simple conversations of the most serene sort, such a heart- 
rending melodrama arose. His honorable course of action is hardly 
enough to compensate for his previous guilt in failing to avert this 
melodrama by not preparing both you and (probably) himself, to main- 
tain a very calm attitude toward all of this, to regard it as pure non- 
sense, as something not worth drinking an extra glass of tea over, or 
not finishing one either. He’s very much to blame. But he’s paid 
enough for it, too. 

“Now have another glass of sherry and go to bed, Vera Pavlovna. I've 
achieved the final goal of my visit. It’s already three o'clock in the 
morning. If no one disturbs you, you'll sleep a very long time. I told 
Masha not to wake you before ten-thirty, so that tomorrow morning 
you'll barely have time to drink your tea before you have to rush off to 
the railway station. If you don't manage to pack all your things, you 
can come back soon or your things can be sent on. Which do you think 
would be best? Should Alexander Matveich leave right after you, or will 
you come back yourself? You'll have a hard time with Masha, since it 
won't do for her to see that you’re completely calm now. She won't 
notice it during your busy half hour of packing. It will be much worse 
with Mertsalova; I'll drop in on her early tomorrow morning and tell 
her not to come by here, since you had such difficulty sleeping and 
shouldn't be disturbed. I'll tell her she should go directly to the rail- 
way station.” 

“What thoughtfulness,” said Vera Pavlovna. 

“You shouldn't attribute it to him. This time it all comes from me. 
Except for the fact that I blamed him for the past (of course, to his face 
I spoke at greater length and with more force), and, I repeat, except for 
the fact that he’s entirely to blame for all this needless suffering, he 
behaved quite admirably once the suffering began.” 


xxxi. A Conversation with the Perspicacious Reader 
Followed by His Expulsion 


Now tell me, O perspicacious reader, why Rakhmetov was intro- 
duced, if now he’s gone and will no longer appear in my story? You've 
already been told that he has no role whatever in the action... . 

“That’s not true,” interrupts the perspicacious reader. “Rakhmetov 
is a principal character: he carried the note in which . . .” 

“You're very poor, my dear sir, in those aesthetic deliberations you 


308 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


so love,” I reply, interrupting him. “In that case would you also con- 
sider Masha a principal character? At the beginning of the story she 
also delivered a letter that horrified Vera Pavlovna. And what about 
Rachel? She gave Vera money for those goods, and without it Vera 
Pavlovna wouldn't have been able to leave. Is Professor N. an important 
character because he recommended Vera Pavlovna as a governess to 
Madame B., and otherwise there would have been no scene upon her 
return from Konnogvardeisky Boulevard? Perhaps even the boulevard 
is a principal character? Without it there would have been no pos- 
sibility of either meeting on it or returning from it. And Gorokhovaya 
Street must then emerge as the most important character of all, since 
without it no houses could stand there, including the Storeshnikovs'’, 
nor would there be a manager, a manager's daughter, or any story at 
all. Well, let's assume that you're right, that they’re all important char- 
acters (Konnogvardeisky Boulevard and Masha, Rachel and Gorokho- 
vaya Street); still, only half a dozen words (or less) are devoted to each of 
them because their role is such that they deserve no more. But look at 
how many pages have been devoted to Rakhmetov.” 

“Oh, now I understand,” says the perspicacious reader. “Rakhmetov 
was introduced in order to pronounce sentence on Vera Pavlovna and 
Lopukhov. He was needed for the conversation with Vera Pavlovna.” 

“Oh, you're so dumb, my dear sir! You've got it all backward. Was it 
really necessary to introduce a special character so that he could 
express his opinion of the others? Perhaps your great literary artists 
introduce characters in their works and discard them according to 
those considerations, but I, although only a poor writer, understand 
nevertheless the requirements of true art somewhat better than that. 
No, my dear sir, Rakhmetov wasn’t needed for that at all! How many 
times have Vera Pavlovna, Lopukhov, and Kirsanov expressed their 
opinions of their own actions and relationships? They're not stupid 
people; they can decide for themselves what’s good and what's bad, 
and have no need for any prompting. Don’t you really think that Vera 
Pavlovna, while enjoying her leisure in a few days, would begin to 
recollect this chaos and would condemn her own disregard for the 
workshop, just as Rakhmetov did? And don’t you think that Lopukhov 
himself reflected on his relations with Vera Pavlovna in precisely the 
same way as Rakhmetov described them to her? He knew it all. Decent 
people know everything that can possibly be said against them; that’s 
precisely why, my dear sir, they’re such decent people. Didn't you 
realize that? You're very poor, my dear sir, in your understanding of 
the way decent people think. I'll say even more. Do you really suppose 
that in his conversation with Vera Pavlovna, Rakhmetov was acting 
independently of Lopukhov? No, my dear sir, he was merely Lopu- 


What Is to Be Done? 309 


khov's agent; he himself understood that fact very well. Vera Pavlovna 
realized it a day or two later, and would have realized it the very 
moment Rakhmetov opened his mouth to speak if she hadn't been so 
upset. That’s how things really were. Didn’t you understand that? Of 
course, in his second note Lopukhov admitted in all honesty that he’d 
said not one word to Rakhmetov, nor he to Lopukhov, about the na- 
ture of Rakhmetov's forthcoming conversation with Vera Pavlovna. Lo- 
pukhov knew Rakhmetov very well; he knew precisely what Rakhme- 
tov thought about certain matters and what he'd say about them. 
Decent people understand each other without having to explain 
themselves; Lopukhov could have written out in advance almost word 
for word everything that Rakhmetov said to Vera Pavlovna, precisely 
because he’d asked Rakhmetov to act as his intermediary. Shall I let 
you in on even deeper psychological mysteries? Lopukhov knew per- 
fectly well that his own opinion of himself was shared by Rakhmetov 
(and Mertsalov, and Mertsalova, and even the officer who wrestled 
with him at the picnic on the island); and that soon even Vera Pavlovna 
would come to share that opinion, even though no one was ever going 
to tell her about it. She’d understand it at once, as soon as the first 
flush of gratitude had passed. Consequently, Lopukhov calculated that 
he'd lose nothing in the final analysis if he sent Rakhmetov, who was 
going to criticize him, since she herself would soon reach the same 
conclusions. On the contrary, Lopukhov would rise in her estimation, 
since she'd soon realize that he'd foreseen the nature of the conversa- 
tion between her and Rakhmetov; she’d realize that he'd arranged the 
conversation and would understand why he'd done so. Then she'd 
think, ‘What a noble person he is! He recognized that during those first 
days of greatest agitation my gratitude to him would be so great that it 
would overwhelm me. He took care to ensure that thoughts would 
occur to me which would lift this burden as soon as possible. Even 
though I got angry at Rakhmetov for abusing Lopukhov, I still realized 
that basically he was speaking the truth. I'd have reached the same 
conclusion myself within a week; but it wouldn't have been so impor- 
tant to me then, since I'd already have felt calm. But this way these 
thoughts were expressed to me the very first day and I was spared the 
spiritual oppression that would otherwise have lasted a whole week. 
That day those thoughts were extremely important to me and very 
useful. .. . Yes, he’s a very noble person.’ 

“Such was the scheme devised by Lopukhov; Rakhmetov was merely 
his agent. You see, my dear sir, O perspicacious reader, what schemers 
these noble people are, and how egoism plays in their souls. It’s differ- 
ent from yours, dear sir, because they take their satisfaction elsewhere. 
They take their greatest satisfaction in having people whom they re- 


310 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


spect regard them as noble; to achieve this end, my dear sir, they work 
hard and devise all sorts of schemes no less diligently than you do in 
pursuit of your goals. Only your goals are different, and so the 
schemes you devise are not the same. You devise schemes that are 
worthless and harmful to others; they devise schemes that are honest 
and useful to others.” 

“How dare you speak to me so rudely?” exclaims the perspicacious 
reader, addressing himself to me. “I'll complain about you and I'll 
spread the word that you're an evil person!” 

“Have mercy, dear sir,” I reply. “Would I dare speak so rudely to you, 
since I respect your character as much as your intellect? I merely wish 
to enlighten you about certain artistic matters that you so love. In this 
respect you're mistaken, dear sir, in assuming that Rakhmetov was 
introduced only to pronounce sentence on Vera Pavlovna and Lopu- 
khov. There was no such necessity. The views he expresses about 
them contain nothing whatever that I couldn’t have communicated to 
you, dear sir, as Lopukhov’s own thoughts about himself, or as 
thoughts that Vera Pavlovna would have had eventually about herself 
and Lopukhov, even without Rakhmetov’s intervention. Now, dear sir, 
here’s a question for you. Why have I included this conversation be- 
tween Rakhmetov and Vera Pavlovna? Do you understand that if | 
choose to convey a conversation between them instead of Lopukhov’s 
or Vera Pavlovna’s thoughts, then it was essential to convey not merely 
the thoughts that made up their conversation but also the conversa- 
tion itself? Why was it necessary to convey that conversation? Because 
it took place between Rakhmetov and Vera Pavlovna. Now do you 
understand? You still don’t? You're a fine one! Not too bright, are you? 
Well, then, I'll have to spoon-feed you. If two people converse, their 
characters become more or less apparent during the course of their 
conversation. Do you see where this is leading? Was Vera Pavlovna’s 
character sufficiently clear to you before this conversation? It was. You 
learned nothing new about her. You already knew that she flares up, 
likes to joke, is not averse to a hearty snack and maybe even an occa- 
sional sip of sherry. In other words, the conversation was unnecessary 
to characterize Vera Pavlovna. Well then? There were two people con- 
versing, she and Rakhmetov. If not her, then, well . . . guess!” 

“Rakhmetov!” exclaims the perspicacious reader. 

“Congratulations, you've guessed it! I like you for that. Now, you see, 
it’s exactly the opposite of what you thought before. It wasn’t that 
Rakhmetov was introduced to have this conversation, but the conver- 
sation was included for the sole purpose of making you better ac- 
quainted with Rakhmetov. As a result you saw that Rakhmetov wanted 
to have some sherry, but didn’t, and that he’s not always a ‘gloomy 


What Is to Be Done? 311 


monster.’ On the contrary, when engaged in some pleasant business, 
he forgets his sorrowful thoughts and his burning grief. He jests and 
chats cheerfully, although he says that this rarely happens, that he’s 
sad it occurs so seldom; that he himself isn’t happy to be such a 
‘gloomy monster,’ but that circumstances are such that a person with 
his ardent love for the good can't help being a ‘gloomy monster.’ If it 
weren't for that, he might spend the whole day joking, laughing, sing- 
ing, and dancing. 

“Now do you understand, my perspicacious reader, that while many 
pages were devoted to a direct description of Rakhmetov's character, 
many more served exclusively to make you better acquainted with an 
individual who is not at all a principal character in the novel? Tell me 
now why this figure was presented and described in such detail. Do 
you recall what I told you earlier? ‘Exclusively to fulfill the fundamen- 
tal requirement of art’? Now consider what that requirement is and 
how I've fulfilled it by presenting you with the figure of Rakhmetov. 
Have you figured it out? No, of course not! Well then, listen here. Even 
better, don’t listen, since you won’t understand. Leave me alone. I've 
made fun of you long enough. Now I’!l speak with the public instead of 
with you, and I'll be very serious. 

“The first requirement of art is as follows: one must always depict 
objects so that the reader can perceive their true form. For example, if I 
want to portray a house, I must see to it that the reader conceives of it 
as a house, and as neither a hovel nor a palace. If I want to depict an 
ordinary person, I must see to it that the reader conceives of him as 
neither a dwarf nor a giant. 

“I wanted to depict decent, ordinary people of the new generation, 
those I meet by the hundreds. I took three such characters: Vera 
Pavlovna, Lopukhov, and Kirsanov. I consider them to be ordinary 
people; they see themselves as such, and their friends, who are the 
same sort of people, consider them to be ordinary. Where have I said 
anything different about them? What have I said that contradicts this? 
I depicted them with love and respect because every decent person is 
worthy of both love and respect. But did I ever bow before their superi- 
ority? Where do you see even the slightest indication that these people 
are God knows how lofty and beautiful and that I can conceive of 
nothing loftier and better than they and that they are ideal human 
beings? Just as I conceive of them, so they behave in my novel, no 
different from decent, ordinary people of the younger generation. 
Where are their noble deeds? They don’t commit base acts, nor do 
they behave in a cowardly manner; they have ordinary, honest convic- 
tions that they try to act upon, and that’s that. What kind of heroism is 
that, may I ask? Yes, I wanted to show people behaving just like all 


312 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


ordinary people of this type; I hope I've succeeded in doing so. I hope 
that those readers who are already acquainted with living examples of 
them will have seen from the very beginning that my main characters 
are not ideals at all, but are no better than the general level of people of 
this sort; every one of them has experienced two or three incidents in 
which these people have acted no worse than my characters. Let's 
suppose that other decent people have experienced events that aren't 
exactly the same as those narrated here. Why, there's absolutely noth- 
ing extraordinary or charming about the idea that all husbands and 
wives should be separated; look here, not every decent woman con- 
ceives a passionate love for her husband's friend, not every decent 
man must struggle against his passion for a married woman (for three 
long years at that), and not every man is forced to shoot himself on a 
bridge or (in the words of the perspicacious reader), to disappear to 
God knows where from a hotel. But on the other hand, every decent 
person would by no means consider it heroic to behave in their place 
as these characters did. He'd be perfectly prepared if this were to 
happen, and indeed has many times behaved no worse in situations 
no less difficult or even more difficult than these, and still he wouldn't 
consider himself an amazing kind of person. He would consider him- 
self merely an average man, nothing special, reasonably honorable. 
The good friends of such a person (also people of the same type, since 
he wouldn't be friends with other types) would also consider that he 
was a good person. They wouldn't even think about getting down on 
their knees before him; they'd think that they’re the same type of 
person as he is. I hope I’ve managed well enough so that every decent 
man of the new generation will recognize an ordinary example of one 
of his good friends in my three main characters. 

“But those readers who from the very beginning of my story will 
think about my main characters, Vera Pavlovna, Kirsanov, and Lopu- 
khov: “Well, these are our good friends, simple, ordinary people, like 
us,” those readers still constitute a minority of the public. The majority 
is still on a much lower level than this. A person who’s never seen 
anything except hovels would look at a picture of an ordinary house 
and mistake it for a luxurious palace. How can one ensure that such a 
person should perceive the house as a house and not a palace? In the 
same picture one must depict at least one corner of a palace. From 
this corner it will be clear that a palace is really a structure of a 
completely different sort than the one in the picture, and the observer 
will realize that the building is really nothing more than a simple, 
ordinary house in which all people should live (if not in better ones). 

“If I hadn’t shown you the figure of Rakhmetov, the majority of 
readers would have misunderstood the main characters of my story. 


What Is to Be Done? 313 


I'd bet that up until the last sections of this chapter most of the public 
considered Vera Pavlovna, Kirsanov, and Lopukhov to be heroes, peo- 
ple of a higher nature, perhaps even idealized figures, maybe even 
inconceivable in reality because of their very great nobility. No, my 
friends, my mean, base, pitiful friends, you're quite mistaken: it’s not 
they who stand too high, but you who stand too low. Now you see that 
they’re simply standing at ground level; they appeared to be soaring 
above the clouds because your're sitting in some godforsaken under- 
world.2°6 All people should and can stand on the same level as they. 
Superior natures, which you, my pitiful friends, and I cannot keep up 
with, aren’t like this at all. I showed you a faint outline of the profile of 
one of them: there you see very different features. But you can become 
an equal to the people described here in full, if only you wish to work a 
bit on your own development. Anyone who is beneath them is very 
low indeed. Come up out of your godforsaken underworld, my friends, 
come up. It’s not so difficult. Come out into the light of day, where life 
is good; the path is easy and inviting. Try it: development, develop- 
ment. Observe, reflect, read those books that tell you about the pure 
enjoyment of life, and about the fact that man can be kind and happy. 
Read them: such books gladden the heart. Observe life: it’s so interest- 
ing. Reflect: it’s so fascinating. That's all there is to it! No sacrifices are 
needed, no deprivations required—they'e all unnecessary. Desire to 
be happy—that's all. Only desire is needed. To attain it you'll take 
delight in devoting yourself to your own development. That’s where 
true happiness lies. Oh, what delights accrue to the developed individ- 
ual! Even things that another person experiences as sacrifice or sor- 
row, he experiences as satisfaction and enjoyment. His heart is wide 
open to joy and he has a great deal of it. Try it—it’s good!” 


206. Chernyshevsky compares the reader and most of society with Vera Pavlovna 
before her liberation from the cellar through the revelations of her first dream (see pp. 
129-31 above). 


CHAPTER FOUR 


Second Marriage 


Berlin 
July 20, 1856 


Much esteemed Madame, Vera Pavlovna: 

My close acquaintance with the late Dmitry Sergeich Lopukhov leads me to 
hope that you will kindly admit into the ranks of your acquaintance a total 
stranger, but one who respects you deeply. In any case, I venture to think that 
you will not accuse me of importunity. In entering into correspondence with 
you I'm merely fulfilling a wish of the late Dmitry Sergeich. The information I 
will communicate about him can be considered completely reliable, for I will 
convey his thoughts in his own words, as if he himself were speaking. Here are 
his own words concerning the matter this letter aims to clarify. 

“The ideas that produced the outcome so disturbing to those people closest 
to me” (I'm conveying Dmitry Sergeich’s original words just as I said I would) 
“matured gradually. My intention changed several times before it assumed its 
definitive form. The circumstance that first occasioned these ideas came to my 
attention in an unexpected way, only when she” (Dmitry Sergeich means you) 
“fearfully told me about the dream that had so terrified her.2°7 That dream 
seemed to me to be very important. As a person who could look at her emo- 
tional state from the outside, I realized at that very moment that a new episode 
in her life was beginning, one that would alter our previous relationship for a 
relatively long time to come. But a person tries to maintain a situation to 
which he's became accustomed to the bitter end; at the very depths of our 
nature lies a conservative element that we relinquish only out of dire necessi- 
ty. Here, in my opinion, lies the explanation of my first proposition: I wanted to 
think, indeed I managed to think, that in time this episode would pass, and 


207. That is, Vera Pavlovna's third dream (see pp. 236-43 above). 


314 


What Is to Be Done? 315 


that our previous relationship would be reestablished. She wished to avoid 
this episode by means of a more intimate relationship with me. This distracted 
me; for several days I was oblivious of the impossibility of realizing her hope. 
Soon, however, I became convinced that this hope was in vain. The reason lay 
in my own character. 

“I don’t wish to defame my character by saying this, but here’s my under- 
standing of it. 

“A man who lives his life as he should divides his time into three parts: work, 
pleasure, and rest or recreation. Pleasure demands rest, just as much as work 
does. Both in work and pleasure the general human component predominates 
over individual peculiarities. In work we act under the predominant motive of 
external, rational necessities; in pleasure, under the predominant motive of 
other, equally general necessities of human nature. Rest or recreation is the 
element in which the personality seeks to renew its strength from these stim- 
uli that exhaust the reserve of human resources. It’s an element introduced 
into life by the person himself. Here the person acts entirely in accordance 
with his own peculiarites, his own individual proclivities. Both in work and in 
pleasure people are drawn to each other by a general powerful force that is 
higher than their own personal peculiarities, that is, by the calculation of 
advantage in work, and by equivalent needs of the organism in pleasure. But 
rest is different. It’s not a matter of a general force acting to smoothe over 
individual particularities. Rest is the most personal affair: human nature de- 
mands more room for itself. A person is more individualized; his character is 
revealed much more in the kind of rest he considers easiest and most enjoy- 
able. 

“In this regard people are divided into two main categories. For people in 
the first category, rest or recreation is more pleasant in the society of others. 
Everyone needs solitude, but for these people solitude must remain an excep- 
tion. The rule for them is life with other people. This class is much more 
numerous than the other one, which requires just the opposite. These people 
feel much freer when alone than in the society of other people. This distinc- 
tion has been noted even in common parlance, where it’s been characterized 
by the words ‘sociable person’ and ‘reserved person.’ I belong to the group of 
unsociable people; she belongs to the sociable group. This is the entire secret 
of our history. It seems clear from this explanation that neither of us is to be 
blamed. Nor should we be blamed for the fact that neither of us had the 
strength to overcome this circumstance: people are powerless against their 
own natures. 

“It’s rather difficult for anyone to understand the peculiarities of other 
natures. Each of us conceives of others in terms of our own selves. Whatever I 
have no need of, no one else does either—that’s the way our individuality 
leads us to think. Blatant indications are required to make me understand 
otherwise. Conversely, whatever brings me relief and a feeling of freedom must 
do the same for others. The naturalness of this way of thinking is my real 
excuse for observing the difference between her nature and my own too late. 
This mistake was compounded by the fact that after we began to live together, 


316 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


she valued me too highly. There was still no equality between us.2°% On her 
side there was too much respect for me; my way of life seemed to her to be 
exemplary. She took as a universal characteristic something that was my own 
personal peculiarity; for a while she was swept away by it. There was also 
another reason, even stronger than this one. 

“The inviolability of the inner life isn't much respected among undeveloped 
people. Each member of the family, especially the older ones, will quite uncer- 
emoniously poke his nose into your intimate life. The point isn't that our 
secrets are violated as a result; we never fail to guard and conceal those secrets 
of greater or lesser value. Besides, not everyone has secrets; many people have 
nothing whatever to hide from their nearest and dearest. But everyone wants 
to have a corner of his inner life where no one else trespasses, just as everyone 
wants to have a separate room for himself alone. Undeveloped people pay little 
attention to one or the other; if you have a separate room, everyone comes 
crashing into it, not out of a desire to pry or intrude but simply because they 
can’t conceive that they might be disturbing you. They consider that only if 
you found them totally repugnant would you prefer that they not drop in on 
you unannounced. They don’t understand that even if you're well disposed 
toward them, you may still be disturbed or annoyed by them. The sanctity of a 
threshhold no one has the right to cross without the consent of the person 
living on the other side is recognized only in one room, the one that belongs to 
the head of the household, because only he can drive out anyone who drops 
in on him without his permission. The rest of us must suffer intrusions from 
anyone either senior to us or equal to us in position in the household. 

“What is true of one’s own room also applies to one's inner life. Anyone can 
intrude upon it for any reason whatsoever, without any need, without any 
intention, idly, and, most often, for nothing better than to jabber away and 
grate against your soul. A young girl has two dresses for everyday wear, one 
white, the other pink. She's put on the pink one; here's a chance for someone 
to grate against her soul. ‘You've put on your pink dress, Anyuta. Why did you 
do that?’ Anyuta doesn’t know herself why she put it on. She had to put 
something on! Besides, if she'd put on the white dress, the result would have 
been the same. ‘I just did, mama’ (or ‘little sister’). ‘You should have put on the 
white one.’ Why? The person speaking to Anyuta doesn't know the answer; 
she’s simply jabbering. ‘Why do you seem so unhappy today, Anyuta?’ Any- 
uta’s neither particularly happy nor unhappy. But why not ask her about 
something that is neither obvious nor even real? ‘I don't know. There's really 
nothing wrong.’ ‘No, you're unhappy for some reason.’ Two minutes later: 
‘Anyuta, why don't you sit down and play the piano a bit.’ Why? Who knows? 
And on it goes for the entire day. It’s as if your soul were an open street ogled 
at by anyone who happens to be sitting next to the window, and not because 
he needs to see anything in particular. No, he even knows that he won't see 


208. In Chernyshevsky’s view, equality between spouses requires the economic inde- 
pendence of both partners as well as their mutual respect and complete freedom to 
form personal, loving relationships. The author's definition of equality emerges most 
clearly in Vera Pavlovna’s fourth dream (pp. 359-79 below). 


What Is to Be Done? 317 


anything necessary or even interesting, but he looks because he has nothing 
better to do. After all, what difference does it make? So why not have a look? 
The street really doesn’t mind. A person, however, takes no pleasure whatever 
from the fact that other people pester him. 

“It’s only natural that this pointless and purposeless pestering can provoke 
a reaction. As soon as a person has a chance to be alone, he takes pleasure in 
his solitude for some time, even though by nature he may be inclined to 
sociability, not to seclusion. 

“From this point of view, before marriage she was placed in an exceptionally 
difficult position. People pestered her and intruded into her soul, not merely 
idly, accidentally, occasionally, or even tactlessly, but systematically, un- 
ceasingly, continually, rudely and arrogantly, maliciously and malevolently 
intruding upon her, not simply with their unceremonious hands, but with 
hands that were rough and exceedingly dirty. That's why her reaction was so 
strong. 

“Therefore, my error shouldn't be judged too harshly. For several months, 
perhaps even a year, I wasn't mistaken. She really needed and enjoyed her 
solitude. That time was enough for me to form an opinion of her character. 
Her strong temporary need corresponded to my permanent need. Is there 
anything astonishing about my mistaking a temporary aspect of her character 
fora permanent one? Everyone's predisposed to make judgments about other 
people according to his own self. 

“An error was committed, and a very big one at that. I don't blame myself, 
but I do wish to justify myself. In other words, I feel that others won't be so 
lenient with me as I am with myself. In order to soften their reprimand, I 
should say a bit more about that side of my own character which is rather 
foreign to her and to a large number of people, because without such an 
explanation, it could be misunderstood. 

“I cannot appreciate any form of rest other than solitude. To be with other 
people means to me to be occupied with something, either work or pleasure. I 
feel entirely free only when I'm completely alone. What shall we call this? Why 
is it so? With some people it results from reticence, with others bashfulness. A 
third group has a tendency to brood or to be depressed. A fourth lacks suffi- 
cient sympathy for other people. But it seems that there's none of this in me. 
I'm frank and straightforward; I'm always ready to be cheerful and am never 
depressed. I enjoy observing people, but this activity is connected with work 
or pleasure; it’s something that requires rest when it’s over. For me that means 
solitude. As far as I can see, it's simply a particular development in me of a 
desire for independence or freedom. 

“Thus it was that the strength of her reaction against the previous all-too- 
disturbing situation in her family forced her temporarily to adopt a way of life 
that didn't correspond to her permanent disposition. Her respect for me 
supported this temporary situation longer than it would have lasted on its 
own. It was during this period that I formed an opinion of her character, 
mistook a temporary characteristic for a permanent one, and stopped worry- 
ing. That's the whole story. There was an error on my part, but little that was 


318 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


evil in it. For her part, there was nothing at all. Yet how much suffering it 
caused her, and what a catastrophe it was for me! 

“When her fright following the terrible dream revealed her emotional state 
to me, it was already too late to rectify my mistake. If we'd noticed it sooner, is 
it possible that with constant effort she and I could have managed to establish 
a relationship that satisfied us both? I don’t know, but I think that even if we’d 
succeeded, nothing very good would have come of it. Let's suppose that we'd 
made ourselves over well enough to make our relations harmonious. But 
making ourself over is effective only when it's directed against some evil pro- 
clivity; but those very proclivities that would have been made over in either her 
or me had nothing evil about them whatsoever. In what way is sociability 
either better or worse than a craving for solitude, or vice versa? After all, 
making ourself over always entails some violence, some breaking apart. In that 
breaking apart much gets lost; in that violence much dies away. The result that 
she and I might (only might, not necessarily would) have achieved wouldn't 
have merited such losses. We would both have deprived ourselves of a portion 
of our true color; we would have more or less stifled the freshness of our lives. 
And for what? In order to maintain certain positions in certain rooms. It would 
have been a different matter if we'd had children; then we should have had to 
consider carefully the impact of our separation on their fate. If their lives 
would be adversely affected, no effort should be spared to avoid that outcome. 
The outcome would be such joy from doing all that was necessary to preserve 
the best possible life for our loved ones. The result would be sufficient reward 
for all one's efforts. But as for us, what rational goal could be achieved? 

“Therefore, given the situation, my error apparently even led to something 
better. As a result, both of us were spared a great deal of the ‘damage.’ My 
mistake occasioned considerable grief, but without it there probably would 
have been even more, and the result wouldn't have been so satisfactory.” 

Such were Dmitry Sergeich’s words. From his persistence in occupying 
himself with this side of the affair, you can easily see, just as he himself said, 
that he felt there was something awkward about it, something not to his own 
advantage. He added quite openly, “I feel that in spite of everything I will not 
be completely exonerated by those who consider this matter without a certain 
sympathy for me. But I’m assured of her sympathy. She'll judge me even more 
generously than I judge myself. And I consider myself completely justified. 
Such is my opinion of the period before she had that dream.” Now I'll convey 
to you his feelings and intentions after your dream revealed to him the un- 
satisfactory nature of the relations between you. 

“I've said” (these are Dmitry Sergeich’s words once again) “that from her very 
first words about that terrible dream I realized the inevitability of some epi- 
sode quite different from our previous relations. I expected that it would have 
considerable force; it was impossible for it to be otherwise, given the energy of 
her nature and the level of her own dissatisfaction, which had already ac- 
quired considerable strength from its prolonged suppression. Nevertheless, at 
first this expectation appeared in the mildest form and the most advantageous 
one for me. I reasoned this way: She'll be distracted for a while by a passionate 


What Is to Be Done? 319 


love for another person. Then, after two years or so, she’ll return to me, since 
I'm such a fine man. The chances of her finding another as good as I are very 
low (I’m saying just what I think about myself; I lack the hypocrisy to under- 
estimate my own worth). A satisfied feeling of love will thus lose some of its 
intensity. She’ll see that although one side of her nature is less well satisfied by 
her life with me, still, on the whole, life with me is easier and freer than with 
the other person. And then everything will be as it was before. Having been 
chastened by experience, I'll pay more attention to her. She'll acquire new 
respect for me and will feel even greater attachment than before; we'll live 
more harmoniously than ever. 

“But (this is something very awkward for me to explain, yet it must be said 
nonetheless) how did I myself conceive of the possibility of our renewed rela- 
tions? Was I overjoyed? Of course. But only that? No, I conceived of it as a 
burden, a pleasant one, to be sure, even a very pleasant one, but a burden 
nevertheless. I love her very much and will do violence to myself to accommo- 
date her better. That will afford me pleasure, but at the same time my life will 
be somewhat constrained. That's the way I conceived of it when I'd calmed 
down after the first impression. I realized that I wasn't deceiving myself. She 
allowed me to experience this myself when she wanted me to try to keep her 
love. The month of satisfying her desire was the most difficult one of my life. 
There was no suffering involved—that word would be inappropriate; it would 
be absurd to use it here. As far as positive sensations are concerned, I experi- 
enced nothing but joy in satisfying her. But I found it tedious. That's the 
explanation of why the attempt to keep her love was so unsuccessful. In 
satisfying her, I was bored. 

“At first glance it may seem strange that I wasn't bored by giving so many 
evenings to students for whom, of course, I wouldn't really put myself out; yet 
I felt great exhaustion when I gave up only a few evenings to the woman I 
loved more than myself, one for whom I was willing to sacrifice my life, and 
not only that; I was willing to suffer any torment for her. It may seem strange, 
but only to someone who hasn't yet penetrated to the heart of my relations 
with these young people to whom I was giving so much of my time. In the first 
place, I had no personal relations with them; when I spent time with them, I 
didn’t feel that I was in the company of other human beings; rather, I merely 
perceived several abstract types exchanging ideas. My conversations with 
them were scarcely distinguished from my solitary reflections. With them only 
one side of me was occupied—the side that least requires rest, namely, my 
intellect. Everything else was asleep. Besides, these conversations had a practi- 
cal, useful goal—they promoted the development of intellectual life, nobility, 
and energy in my young friends. This was work; but the work was so easy it 
served to replenish my efforts expended on other labors. It wasn’t exhausting, 
but refreshing; but it was work nonetheless. Therefore, my personality made 
no demands for rest. I was seeking to serve, not to relax. All other parts of my 
being were asleep, except for my intellect. And that functioned without any 
admixture of personal relations for those individuals with whom I conversed. 
Therefore, I felt just as free as if I were alone. One might say that these 


320 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


conversations didn’t even draw me out of my solitude. There was nothing here 
like relations in which the whole person participates. 

“I know how awkward it is to utter the word ‘boredom,’ but in good con- 
science I can’t avoid it. Yes, in spite of all my love for her, I felt relieved when I 
later became convinced that relations couldn't be reestablished that would 
allow us to live as comfortably as we had before. I began to be convinced of this 
just about the time she began to notice that I found satisfying her desires a 
burden. Then I began to conceive of the future in a new way, one that was 
more pleasant for me. Having realized that we could no longer maintain our 
previous relations, I began to think how soon it would be possible—once 
again I must use an awkward phrase—how soon it would be possible to rid 
myself, to free myself of a situation that I found so tedious. Here's the secret of 
what must have seemed like generosity to a man who wished to blind himself 
with a superficial outlook, or to a man who was too distant to perceive the true 
nature of my motives. Yes, | simply wanted to free myself from a tedious 
situation. So as not to be hypocritical and ignore the good in myself, | won't 
deny that one of my motives was a desire for her well-being. But this motive 
was of only secondary importance; it was very strong, to be sure, but still much 
less intense than the first and main reason, my desire to escape from bore- 
dom. That was my real motive. Under its influence I began to examine her way 
of life carefully. I easily perceived that the change in her feelings, resulting 
from a change in her way of life, was produced primarily by the appearance 
and disappearance of Alexander Matveich. This forced me to think about him 
as well. I realized the reason for his strange actions, which previously had not 
attracted my attention. Afterward my thoughts took a new direction, as I have 
said, one that was more pleasant to me. When I saw that she not only wanted 
passionate love but felt passionate love herself, although she was still not 
conscious of it, and when I realized that this feeling was directed at a person 
who was entirely worthy and fully capable of replacing me, and that this 
person loved her passionately as well—I was overjoyed. It's true, however, that 
the first impression was painful: every important change is accompanied by 
some sorrow. I realized that in good conscience I was no longer able to 
consider myself indispensable to her. Yet I'd become accustomed to that; and, 
to tell the truth, I found it pleasant. So losing this relationship necessarily had 
a painful side to it. But it was only at first, and not for very long, that it 
prevailed over the other side, the one that made me feel overjoyed. Now I was 
assured of her happiness and felt serene in contemplating her fate. This was a 
source of great joy. But it would be in vain to conclude that this was my 
greatest pleasure. No, the personal feeling was once again much more impor- 
tant. I saw that I was becoming liberated from any compulsion. My words 
aren't intended to suggest that I consider single life any freer and easier than 
married life. No, if a husband and wife feel no need to constrain themselves in 
any way in order to gratify each other, if theyre content without having to 
make an effort, if they please each other without trying, then the closer rela- 
tions are between them, the freer and easier it is for them both. But relations 
between her and me weren't like that. Therefore, separation meant freedom 
for me. 


What Is to Be Done? 321 


“From this it’s clear that [ acted in my own self-interest when I decided not 
to interfere in her happiness. There was a noble side to my conduct, but the 
principal force was that of my own nature seeking its own good. That's why I 
had the strength to act so well, if | may say so myself. I didn’t vacillate at all; I 
didn't create any unnecessary fuss or unpleasantness for others; and I didn't 
betray my obligation. It’s easy when obligation corresponds to the inclination 
of your own nature. 

“I left for Ryazan. Some time later she called me back, saying that my pres- 
ence would no longer interfere with her life. But I saw that it did. As far as I 
could understand, there were two main reasons. She found it painful to see 
the man to whom, in her opinion, she was so exceedingly indebted. Here she 
was mistaken; she was in no way indebted to me, since I was acting far more 
for myself than for her. But she saw it differently and felt a large debt of 
gratitude to me. And that is a burdensome feeling; it has a pleasant side, but 
this predominates only when the feeling of gratitude isn’t too strong. When it 
is strong, it's oppressive. The other reason—and once again it’s a fairly deli- 
cate matter to explain, but I have to say what I think—the other reason lies in 
the unpleasant abnormality of her position vis-a-vis social convention. She 
found it painful that society did not formally recognize her right to occupy 
that position. And so I realized that she would find it painful if I carried on my 
existence at her side. I won't hide the fact that this new discovery had an 
aspect that was incomparably more painful than all the feelings I had experi- 
enced in earlier stages of this affair. I was still very favorably disposed toward 
her: I wanted to remain her close friend. I'd hoped that this would still be 
possible. When I saw that it could no longer be, I felt very, very sad. There was 
no recompense for this sadness in any calculation of self-interest. I can say 
that my decision, my final decision, was taken solely out of my attachment to 
her, only out of a desire for things to be better for her, exclusively from 
unselfish motives. On the other hand, never did my relations to her, even at 
the best of times, afford me such inner pleasure as did that resolution. Here I 
was acting under the influence of what I can call nobility, or more accurately, 
noble calculation, that is, where the general law of human nature acts entirely 
by itself, without borrowing any support from individual particularties. And 
here I learned what a sublime pleasure it is to feel oneself acting like a noble 
person, that is, as every man should act—not Ivan or Peter, but every man, 
without specifying any name. What a sublime pleasure to feel oneself simply a 
man—not Ivan or Peter, but a man, purely and simply. This feeling is too 
powerful; ordinary natures such as mine cannot endure too often being ele- 
vated to this level of feeling. But happy is he who has the occasional oppor- 
tunity to experience it. 

“There's no need to explain the side of my behavior which would have been 
most unreasonable if I had been dealing with other people, but which was 
very Clearly justified by the character of the person to whom I was yielding. As 
I was leaving for Ryazan, not one word was spoken between her and Alexander 
Matveich. When I was making my final decision, not one word was exchanged 
between him and me, or between her and me. But I knew him very well; I had 
no need to ascertain his thoughts in order to know what they were.” 


322 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


I have conveyed Dimitry Sergeich’s words with literal accuracy, as I stated 
above. 

I am a total stranger to you. But this correspondence upon which I have 
entered in fulfillment of the late Dmitry Sergeich’s request is so intimate that 
you are probably interested in learning who your strange correspondent is, 
since he’s so conversant with the inner life of the late Dmitry Sergeich. I am a 
former medical student. I have nothing more to add about myself. Recently I 
was living in Petersburg. Several days ago I decided to travel and seek a new 
career for myself abroad. I left Petersburg the day after you learned about 
Dmitry Sergeich’s death. For a special reason I had no documents and had to 
use someone else’s papers, which one of our mutual acquaintances was kind 
enough to provide. He gave them to me on condition that I carry out several 
commissions along the way. When you next have the opportunity to see Mr. 
Rakhmetov, be so kind as to tell him that all his commissions have been 
carried out just as he requested. Now I shall wander around, probably in 
Germany, to observe the customs there. I have several hundred rubles and 
want to have a good time. When I'm tired of such idleness, I'll look for some 
employment. What kind? Who cares. Where? Wherever. . . . I'm as free as a 
bird and can be as carefree as one, too. What a delightful situation! 

It’s likely that you may wish to favor me with a reply. But I don't know where 
I'll be a week from now—perhaps in Italy, or in England, or in Prague. Now I| 
can live by my fantasy; I don’t know where it will lead me. Therefore, use only 
the following address on your letters: Berlin, Friedrichstrasse, 20, Agentur von 
H. Schweigler.2°? Put your letter into another envelope and place it inside. On 
the inner envelope, instead of any address, write only thenumbers 12345. That 
will indicate to the agents at Schweigler’s that the letter should be forwarded 
to me. 

Most esteemed Madame, accept my assurances of deep respect from a 
person who is a total stranger, but one who is profoundly devoted to you, and 
who will sign himself only as 

A FORMER MEDICAL STUDENT 


Most esteemed Sir, Alexander Matveich: 

In accordance with the wishes of the late Dmitry Sergeich, I must assure you 
that he considered yielding his place to you to be the best possible solution to 
the whole affair. Given the relations that occasioned this change, relations that 
were being formed gradually over the three years after you had almost ceased 
your visits, therefore relations with which you had nothing to do, which arose 
solely from the incompatibility of these two people whom you later tried in 
vain to reconcile—given these relations, the final outcome, just as it occurred, 
was inevitable. Obviously Dmitry Sergeich could in no way attribute it to you. 
Of course, this explanation is superfluous; however, more for form’s sake than 
anything else, he charged me with making it. One way or another, one person 
or another had to take the place that he couldn't fill, and another would take it 


209. The name Schweigler is derived from the German verb schweigen, to be silent or 
to hold one’s tongue. The letter writer is indicating that the addressee is trustworthy. 


What Is to Be Done? 323 


only because Dmitry Sergeich was unable to fill it. The fact that it was you who 
came along was, in the opinion of the deceased Dmitry Sergeich, the best 
possible solution for everyone. I shake your hand warmly. 

A FORMER MEDICAL STUDENT 


“Oh, I know... .” 

What's that? A familiar voice. ... I turn around to look... . Sure 
enough! It’s he, the perspicacious reader, recently banished in dis- 
grace for his total ignorance of the ABC’s of art. Here he is again, once 
more with his old perspicacity, claiming that he knows something! 

“Oh, I know who wrote that. .. .” 

I hastily seize the first convenient object that comes to hand which 
will suit my purpose—it’s a napkin, because having transcribed the 
letter written by the former medical student, I’ve just sat down to 
lunch. So I seize a napkin and stuff it in his mouth. “Well, what if you 
do! Is that any reason to shout it from the rooftops?” 


ii. 
Petersburg 
August 25, 1856 


Dear Sir, 

You'll understand how delighted I was to receive your letter. I thank you for 
it from the bottom of my heart. Your intimacy with the late Dmitry Sergeich 
gives me the right to consider you my friend too, if you'll allow me to use that 
designation. Dmitry Sergeich’s character is evident in all the words you con- 
veyed. He was always searching for the most hidden reasons for his actions 
and it gave him great pleasure to subsume them to his theory of egoism. 
However, this habit is shared by our entire circle. My Alexander is also fond of 
analyzing himself in this same vein. If only you could hear how he explains his 
own behavior in regard to me and Dmitry Sergeich over these last three years. 
According to him, he did everything out of egoistic calculation, for his own 
satisfaction. I too have adopted this habit, but it occupies me and Alexander 
somewhat less than it did Dmitry Sergeich. We agree with him entirely, but he 
had a stronger interest in theory. To hear us tell it, we three are the greatest 
egoists the world has ever known. Perhaps that’s even true! Perhaps there 
were no great egoists before us! Yes, that seems to be the case. 

Besides this trait shared by all three of us, Dmitry Sergeich’s words reveal 
another one that belongs specifically to his own situation: the obvious aim of 
his explanation was to comfort me. Not that his words were insincere. No, he 
would never say something he didn’t believe. But he overemphasized the part 
of the truth that could give me comfort. My friend, I’m very grateful for this, but 
I too am an egoist; I say that he shouldn't have worried about my peace of 
mind exclusively. We can justify ourselves much more easily than other peo- 


324 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


ple can justify us. To tell the truth, I don't consider myself guilty before him in 
any way. I'll say even more: I don’t even consider myself obligated to feel 
grateful to him. I value his nobility, oh, how I value it. But I know that he 
behaved nobly not for me but for himself. Why, I too, when I didn't deceive 
him, did it not for him but for myself, not because deception would have been 
unfair to him but because it would have been repugnant to me. 

I said that I don't blame myself, just as he said. But I also feel inclined to 
justify myself just as he did. In his own (very accurate) words, that means I 
foresee that others won't absolve me of blame (as easily as | did myself) for 
certain aspects of my behavior. I feel no desire to justify myself for that part of 
the affair for which he justifies himself; on the other hand, I want to justify 
myself for the part for which there is no need for him to justify himself. As for 
what happened before my dream, I'm convinced that no one will think me to 
blame in any way. But afterward, was I not the reason that the affair took such 
a melodramatic form and led to such a theatrical catastrophe? Shouldn't | 
have taken a much simpler view of the change in our relations, one that was 
already inevitable when my dream revealed for the first time our respective 
positions both to me and to Dmitry Sergeich? On the evening of the same day 
Dmitry Sergeich perished, I had a long conversation with that formidable 
Rakhmetov—what a kind, tender man he is! He told me all kinds of terrible 
things about Dmitry Sergeich. If I were to repeat them in a tone sympathetic to 
Dmitry instead of in the cruel, almost hostile one that Rakhmetov used, then 
those things might indeed be true. I suspect that Dmitry Sergeich fully under- 
stood the things that Rakhmetov would say; that had probably entered into his 
calculation. Yes, I needed to hear it then; it comforted me greatly. And whoever 
it was who arranged that conversation, I am very grateful for it, my friend. But 
even the formidable -Rakhmetov had to acknowledge that Dmitry Sergeich 
behaved excellently during the latter half of the affair. Rakhmetov faulted him 
only for the first half, where Dmitry Sergeich felt the need to justify himself. I 
shall justify myself for the second half, although no one has told me that I am 
to blame for it. But each one of us—I'm speaking now about us and our 
friends, our entire circle—each one of us has a sterner judge than Rakhmetov. 
That judge is our own intellect. 

Yes, | understand, my friend, that it would have been much easier for 
everyone if I'd taken a simpler view of this affair and hadn't attributed such 
tragic significance to it. According to Dmitry Sergeich’s view, one should say 
even more. In that case he would have had no need to resort to such a 
theatrical climax, one that must have caused him great pain. He was driven to 
it only by my excessive alarm. I understand this was how it must have seemed 
to him, although he didn’t charge you with conveying all this to me. I value his 
favorable attitude toward me all the more, and the fact that it hasn't di- 
minished as a result of such an opinion. But listen, my friend, it's not entirely 
fair; it’s not fair at all. It wasn’t my mistake, not my excessive alarm that caused 
Dmitry Sergeich to experience something that he himself described as very 
painful. It’s true that if I hadn't attributed such excessive importance to the 
change in our relations, it might have been possible to manage without the 


What Is to Be Done? 325 


journey to Ryazan. But he says that he didn't find it painful. So here again, no 
great harm was done by my exalted view. The only thing that was painful for 
Dmitry Sergeich was the necessity of dying. He explained the inevitability of 
his decision in two ways: I was suffering from excessive gratitude to him and 
was tormented because | couldn't establish the relations with Alexander Mat- 
veich which social convention demanded. True, I wasn't really completely at 
ease. I was burdened by my situation until his death, but he didn’t guess the 
real reason. He thought his presence imposed an excessive burden of grati- 
tude on me, but that wasn’t quite true. People have a strong tendency to 
search for those ideas that can best soothe them. At the time Dmitry Sergeich 
saw the necessity of his death, this particular reason no longer existed. My 
feeling of gratitude toward him had long since moderated into a pleasant 
feeling. This was the only factor that had a connection with my previous 
exalted view of the affair. The other factor that Dimitry Sergeich mentioned, 
my desire to give my relations with Alexander Matveich a form acknowledged 
by society, no longer depended on my view of the affair. Rather, it followed 
from society's ideas. I had no power over it. But Dmitry Sergeich is totally 
mistaken in thinking that for this reason I found his presence painful. No, that 
would have been easy to arrange even without his death, if it had really been 
necessary, and if it would have been enough for me. If a husband lives together 
with his wife, that’s all society needs not to create a scandal about the wife, no 
matter what kind of relations she has with another person. That's a great 
success! We see many examples where, thanks to the husband's nobility, the 
matter is resolved in this way; in all these cases society leaves the wife in 
peace. Now I consider this the best and easiest means of arranging affairs such 
as ours. Dmitry Sergeich had proposed it earlier, but I'd rejected it out of my 
own exalted feelings. I don’t know how things would have turned out if I'd 
accepted it then. If I could have been content with the fact that society would 
leave me in peace, wouldn't create a scandal, and wouldn't want to know 
about my relations with Alexander, then, of course, the means that Dmitry 
Sergeich proposed would have been sufficient and he wouldn't have had to 
resort to suicide. Then, of course, I would have had no reason to wish for my 
relations with Alexander to be defined in any formal way. But it seems to me 
that this arrangement, satisfactory in a majority of cases such as ours, 
wouldn't be appropriate in our case. Our situation had the rare, peculiar 
feature that all three parties concerned were of equal strength. If Dmitry 
Sergeich had believed Alexander to be superior in terms of intellect, develop- 
ment, or character, if in yielding his place to Alexander he were yielding to 
superior moral strength, if his withdrawal hadn't been voluntary but had been 
merely a retreat of the weak before the strong, then of course I would have no 
reason to feel so burdened. It would be exactly the same if I were stronger than 
Dmitry Sergeich in terms of intellect or character, or if, before the emergence 
of my relations with Alexander, he'd been the sort so well characterized by the 
anecdote over which, you remember, my friend, we laughed so much—the 
one about two gentlemen who met in the foyer of an opera house, struck up a 
conversation, liked each other, and wanted to get better acquainted. “I'm 


326 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Lieutenant So-and-So,” said the one, introducing himself. “And I'm the hus- 
band of Madame Tedesco,” replied the other.?'° If Dmitry Sergeich had been 
merely “the husband of Madame Tedesco,” then of course there would have 
been no need for him to die. He would have yielded, submitted, and, if he’d 
been a noble person, he'd have seen nothing demeaning in his own submis- 
sion and everything would have been splendid. But his relation to me and to 
Alexander was not at all like that. He wasn’t weaker or baser than either of us, 
not by a single iota. And we knew it, and he knew it. His yielding was not the 
result of weakness, not at all! It was purely a matter of his own free will. Isn't 
that so, my friend? You can't deny that! Therefore, what was the situation in 
which I found myself? That, my friend, is the crux of the matter. I found myself 
in a situation of dependence on his free will. That’s why my position was so 
painful and that’s why he saw the necessity for his noble decision to perish. 
Yes, my friend, the reason for my feeling which compelled him to this act was 
much more deeply hidden than your letter explained. The overwhelming 
burden of gratitude no longer existed. It would have been easy to satisfy 
society's claims in the way Dmitry Sergeich proposed. Those claims would not 
even touch me, living as I did within our small circle completely cut off from 
such claims. But I remained dependent on Dmitry Sergeich. My position was 
based only on his free will; it wasn't independent. That is why it was so 
painful. Now you can decide whether this factor cculd be eliminated by my 
holding any particular view of the change in our relations. The important 
thing wasn't my view, but the fact that Dmitry Sergeich was an independent 
person, one whose actions were determined entirely by his own free will, by 
his will alone! Yes, my friend, you recognize and approve this feeling of mine. I 
don't wish to depend on anyone’s will—no matter whose—even a person 
devoted to me, one | respect highly, one | trust as I do myself, one who, I am 
certain, would always gladly do what I required, one who values my happiness 
no less than I do. Yes, my friend, I don't want this and I know that you approve 
of my position. 

But why am I saying all this? Why all this analysis, revealing the most hidden 
sources of feeling which no one could discover? I too, like Dmitry Sergeich, am 
engaging in this self-exposure in my own interest, so that I may say, “I'm not to 
blame. The affair depended on circumstances beyond my control.” I make this 
remark because Dmitry Sergeich was so fond of such remarks. I wish to be in 
your good graces, my friend. 

But enough of this! You had so much sympathy for me that you didn't regret 
spending several hours of your own time writing me a long letter (one that was 
so very precious to me). As a result I can see, as I diplomatically use precisely 
those phrases that you and Dmitry Sergeich used, yes, as a result, only as a 
result of this can I see that you would be interested in learning what became of 
me after Dmitry Sergeich said farewell and left for Moscow in order to come 
back and perish. When he returned from Ryazan, he saw that I was distraught.

Petersburg in 1859. 


What Is to Be Done? 327 


This became clearly apparent in me only upon his return. To tell the truth, 
while he was living in Ryazan, I didn’t think about him very much. No, not as 
much as you suppose, judging by what he saw when he returned. But when 
he left for Moscow I realized that he was contemplating something unusual. It 
was obvious that he was winding up his affairs in Petersburg; it was clear that 
for a week or so he'd been waiting on certain matters in order to leave. And 
then—how could it have been otherwise? In the final days I sometimes ob- 
served some sadness in his face, which is quite capable of concealing secrets. I 
had a premonition that something decisive was imminent, something drastic. 
When he boarded the train, I felt very, very sad. All the next day I grieved. On 
the morning of the third day I awoke even sadder; suddenly Masha brought 
me a letter. What a tormenting moment it was, what a tormenting hour, a 
tormenting day—but you know that. Therefore, my friend, I now understand 
better than ever the strength of my attachment to Dmitry Sergeich. I myself 
didn’t think that it was so strong. Yes, my friend, I now know its strength; and 
you do too, because, of course, you know that I had decided to part with 
Alexander. All that day I felt my life had been shattered, poisoned forever. You 
know, too, my childlike ecstasy at the sight of that note from my good, kind 
friend, a note that completely altered my way of thinking. (Do you see how 
carefully my phrases have been chosen? You should be very satisfied with me, 
my friend.) You know all this because Rakhmetov left to accompany you after 
he put me on the train. He and Dmitry Sergeich were right in saying that I had 
to leave Petersburg in order to produce the desired effect—for the sake of 
which Dmitry Sergeich didn’t hesitate to leave me in terrible agony for one 
whole day. I'm so grateful to him for that lack of mercy! He and Rakhmetov 
were also correct in advising Alexander not to visit me and not to accompany 
me to the station. Since there was no longer any need for me to go to Moscow, 
only to leave Petersburg, I stopped in Novgorod.2!! Several days later Alex- 
ander arrived there and brought with him documents attesting to Dmitry 
Sergeich’s death. We were married about a week after his death and livedfor a 
month or so near the railroad station in Chudovo,?!2 so that Alexander could 
travel conveniently back to his hospital three or four times a week. We re- 
turned to Petersburg yesterday—and that’s the reason it took me so long to 
answer your letter. It was lying in Masha’s drawer and she'd almost forgotten 
all about it. Meanwhile, you were probably thinking up God-knows-what kind 
of reasons for my not answering. 
I embrace you, my dear friend, 
Yours,

I shake your hand, my dear friend. Only please don’t pay me any more 
compliments, or I'll pour forth a whole stream of heartfelt pronouncements on 
your nobility. And of course there could be nothing more sickening for you 
than that! Do you know what? Doesn't it prove the existence of considerable 
stupidity both in you and in me that we are exchanging only a few lines? It 
does seem to indicate that we both feel a bit embarrassed. Now, let's suppose 
that’s understandable on my part; what right do you have? But next time I 
hope to speak with you more freely and to write you a heap of local news. 

Yours,

These letters, absolutely sincere, were really somewhat one-sided, 
as Vera Pavlovna noticed herself. Of course, both correspondents tried 
to lessen the strength of the painful shocks they'd suffered. Oh, these 
people are so clever! I’ve often heard from them, that is, from them and 
people like them, things that made me laugh in the middle of their 
emotional assurances that “it was nothing at all, really nothing.” Natu- 
rally, I laugh both when these assurances are made to me by a stranger 
and when they're made in private conversation. But when the same 
thing is said to someone who needs to hear it, then I always go along 
and agree that it really was “nothing at all.” An honorable man is such 
an amusing creature! I've always laughed at every honorable man with 
whom I've been acquainted. 

Such an amusing creature, even to the point of absurdity. Take these 
letters, for instance. My friendship with ladies and gentlemen of this 
type has made me somewhat accustomed to these tricks of theirs. But 
what sort of impression would they make on an inexperienced, un- 
spoiled person—for example, on the perspicacious reader? 

The perspicacious reader has already managed to free his mouth of 
the napkin; shaking his head from side to side, he says solemnly, 
“What immorality!” 

“Splendid! You've guessed it!” I say in praise of him. “Well, make us 
happy by saying a little more.” 

“And the author is an immoral man,” intones the perspicacious 
reader. “See what kinds of behavior he condones.” 

“No, dearie, you’re mistaken. There’s much that I don’t condone 
here. In fact, to tell you the truth, I don’t condone any of it. It’s all too 
contrived, too exalted. Life is much simpler.” 

“So then you're even more immoral?” asks the perspicacious reader, 


, 


N 


What Is to Be Done? 329 


eyes bulging from astonishment at the incomprehensible immorality 
to which humanity, as represented in my person, has fallen. 

“Much more immoral,” I reply. And no one knows whether I’m 
telling the truth or making fun of the perspicacious reader. 

The correspondence continued for another three or four months, 
actively on the part of the Kirsanovs, negligently and infrequently on 
the part of their correspondent. Then he stopped answering their 
letters altogether. It was obvious that he’d only wanted to convey to 
Vera Pavlovna and her husband those thoughts of Lopukhov’s which 
were contained in that first long letter. After fulfilling this obligation, 
he considered any further correspondence unnecessary. After two or 
three of their letters had gone unanswered, the Kirsanovs understood 
and stopped writing. 


iv. 


Vera Pavlovna is resting on her soft couch, waiting for her husband 
to return home for dinner from the hospital. Today she fussed very 
little over a dessert for the meal; she felt more like lying down and 
resting, since she'd worked her fill that morning. It’s been like this for 
some time and for quite a while she'll continue to have plenty of work 
in the mornings because she’s organizing a second workshop at the 
other end of town. Vera Pavlovna Lopukhova had lived on Vasilievsky 
Island. Vera Pavlovna Kirsanova resides on Sergievsky [Sergei] Street 
because her husband needs an apartment closer to the Vyborg dis- 
trict.213 Natasha Mertsalova proved to be very capable of managing the 
shop on Vasilievsky Island; that was only natural, since she and the 
workshop were old friends. Upon her return to Petersburg, Vera Pav- 
lovna realized that she didn’t need to visit the workshop very often or 
stay very long. If she continued to go there almost every day, it was 
only because she was drawn there by affectionate attachment and was 
greeted there by the same. Perhaps for a little while longer her visits 
there won't be altogether without benefit, since Mertsalova still finds it 
necessary to confer with her on occasion. But this takes very little time 
and happens less and less often. Soon Mertsalova will have acquired 
enough experience so that she'll no longer need Vera Pavlovna’s ad- 
vice. Yes, ever since she returned to Petersburg Vera Pavlovna has been

contained a substantial working-class population that could be proselytized by radical 
intellectuals such as Kirsanov (see n. 26 above).

visiting the workshop on Vasilievsky Island more as a beloved guest 
than as an indispensable figure. What should she do? The answer was 
clear: she should organize another workshop in her new neighbor- 
hood at the other end of town. 

So a new workshop was soon established in one of the side streets 
between Basseiny [Basin] and Sergievsky Streets. Much less effort was 
involved than with the first one. Five girls who comprised the basic 
staff transferred from the first workshop; their places were soon taken 
by new girls. The remaining staff was recruited from close acquain- 
tances of those seamstresses who worked in the first shop. In other 
words, almost half the task was already done. The goal and structure 
of the workshop were familiar to all members of the company; the new 
girls came with the wish that the order that had taken so long to 
establish in the other workshop should be present here from the very 
first day. Oh, now the process of organization goes ten times faster 
than before, and with only about a third the trouble. Still, there’s a 
great deal of work to be done, and Vera Pavlovna is as tired today as 
she was yesterday and the day before that, and as she was two months 
ago, only two months, although more than half a year has already 
passed since her second marriage. After all, she needed to have a 
honeymoon, and she enjoyed a long one. But now she’s gone back to 
work. 

Yes, today she’s worked very hard and now she's resting. She's 
thinking about many things, a great many things, mostly about the 
present. It’s so splendid and full! It’s so full of life that she rarely has 
time to reminisce. Reminiscences will come later, much later, not in 
ten years or even in twenty, but much later; it’s not time for them now, 
and it won't be for some years to come. But they still come even now, 
on occasion; today, for example, she recollects something that occurs 
to her most often in these infrequent reminiscences. Here's what she 
recalls. ... 


“Dearest, I'm going with you!” 

“But you don't have your things ready.” 

“My dear, I'll come after you tomorrow, since you don't want to take 
me with you today.” 

“Think about it. Consider it. Wait for my letter. It will arrive tomor- 
row.” 

Now she was returning home. What was she feeling as she drove 


along with Masha? What was she thinking and feeling during that 


What Is to Be Done? 331 


whole long trip from the Moscow Station to Middle Prospekt? She 
didn’t know herself, so shaken was she by the sudden turn of events. 
Not even a full day had passed (there were still two hours left to make 
a full day) since he'd found her letter in his room, and he'd already 
gone. It was so soon, so sudden! At two o'clock in the morning she 
hadn't foreseen anything of the sort. He waited until she was so ex- 
hausted from that morning’s upset that she could no longer resist 
sleep; he came in and said only a few words. Those words constituted 
merely an incomprehensible preface to what he really wanted to say; 
he said what he wanted in a very few short words: “I haven't seen my 
parents for quite some time. I plan to go visit them. They’ll be very 
pleased.” That’s all; then he left at once. She ran after him, even though 
when he entered he had made her promise not to; still, she ran after 
him. Where is he? “Masha, where is he? Where?” Masha, who was still 
clearing away the tea service after the guests’ departure, replied, “Dmi- 
try Sergeich went out. As he came through he said he was going to take 
a walk.” She should go back to bed. How on earth did she manage to 
fall asleep? She had no idea what that dawning morning would bring. 
He said that they would have time to talk things over. But as soon as 
she'd arisen, it was time to leave for the railway station. Yes, all this 
merely flashed before her eyes as if it never really happened, as if 
someone told her hurriedly what had occurred to someone else. Only 
now, having returned home from the railway station, did she come to 
her senses and begin to think about what was happening to her and 
what might become of her. 

Yes, she'd go to Ryazan. She would. There was no other way. But 
that letter? What would it contain? No, why wait for that letter to 
decide what to do? She knew what would be in it. Still, she had to 
postpone her decision until she received the letter. Why? She would 
go. Yes, she would. That's what she thought for an hour or two, for 
three or four hours. But Masha had gotten hungry and was summon- 
ing her to dinner for the third time; this time it sounded more like an 
order than a summons. So what? It would provide a distraction. “Poor 
Masha, I've starved her to death.” “Why did you wait for me, Masha? 
You should have eaten your dinner and not waited.” “How could I, 
Vera Pavlovna?” Once again she thought about it for an hour or two. “I 
shall go. Yes, tomorrow. But I'll wait for the letter because he asked me 
to. But whatever it contains—and I know full well what will be in it— 
all the same, whatever it contains, I will go.” This is what she thought 
for an hour or two. Well, it's what she thought for one hour. But is that 
really what she thought for the second hour? No, although she did 
keep on thinking that, she also thought four words, four very little 
words, “He doesn't want that.” She thought those four little words 


332 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


more and more; the sun was setting, but she kept thinking those four 
little words. Suddenly, just when the importunate Masha came in 
again, this time to demand that Vera Pavlovna have some tea, just at 
that moment there emerged from those four little words five new ones: 
“I don’t want that either.” What a good thing that importunate Masha 
had come in! She drove away those five new little words. 

But even the beneficent Masha couldn't drive away those five little 
words for very long. At first they didn’t dare appear by themselves; 
they were accompanied by their own refutation, “But I must go.” How- 
ever, the refutation served only as a cover under which these five little 
words could return. At one moment they appeared together with their 
carrier, those four little words, “He doesn’t want that”; then, almost at 
the same time, these four littke words were transformed again into the 
five little words, “I don’t want that either.” That's what she thought for 
half an hour; after that, the four little words and the five little words 
began of their own accord to recast all of her previous words, even the 
most important ones. Of the three most important, “I shall go,” there 
emerged three new words, similar, but not quite the same: “Shall I go?” 
That's precisely the way words appear and are transformed! But here 
comes Masha again: “I gave him a silver ruble, Vera Pavlovna, since it 
says here, ‘If he delivers this letter before nine o'clock, give him a silver 
ruble; after nine, only fifty kopecks.’ The conductor brought it, Vera 
Pavlovna; he came on the evening train. He said he did what he’d 
promised; he'd even taken a cab to make it faster. A letter from him! 
Yes! She knew what it would contain: “Don’t come.” But she'd go 
anyway. She didn’t want to hear what the letter had to say; she 
wouldn't listen to it. She’d go anyway, yes, she would. No, that’s not 
what the letter contained. Here’s what it said, and she had to listen to 
it: “I’m going to Ryazan, but not right away. I have a great deal of 
factory business to attend to along the way. In addition to Moscow, 
where I have so much to do that I'll stay there about a week, I must 
also stop in two towns before Moscow and three towns after it, before I 
even get to Ryazan. How long I'll spend in each place, and where I'll be 
when, I can’t say with any certainty. Part of my business consists in 
collecting some money from our commercial correspondents,?!4 and 
you know, my dear friend . . . "(Yes, that’s what was in the letter, “my 
dear friend.’ He repeated it several times so that I’d see he was just as 
favorably disposed toward me as before and harbored no ill will. Vera 
Pavlovna recalled how she kissed those three words, “my dear friend.’ ) 
Yes, that’s what it said, “my dear friend, you know that when one is 
collecting money, it’s often necessary to spend several days in a place 


214. A commercial correspondent is an agent who represents a business firm. 


What Is to Be Done? 333 


where one had intended to be only a few hours. Therefore, I have no 
idea at all of when I'll reach Ryazan; I know only that it’s not likely to 
be very soon.” She recalled this letter almost word for word. What’s 
this? Yes, he’d entirely eliminated the possibility of her clinging to him 
in order to remain close to him. What should she do now? Her pre- 
vious words, “I must go to him,” were being transformed into the 
words “But I mustn't see him,” but this “him” didn't refer to the same 
person about whom she was thinking before. These words replaced all 
previous words; for an hour or two she thought, “I mustn't see him.” 
Somehow or other at some point these words managed to change into 
other ones, “Will I really want to see him? No.” By the time she began 
to fall asleep, these words had become “Can it be that I'll really see 
him?” Where’s the answer? When did it disappear? Scarcely had these 
words emerged, when they joined with the words “Will I really never 
see him?” As she finally fell asleep near dawn, she did so with the 
words “Will I really never see him again?” 

When she awoke later that morning, in place of all previous words 
there remained only a struggle between two phrases, “I won't see him” 
and “I will see him.” This continued all morning. Everything else was 
forgotten in this struggle, everything. “Won't” tries to suppress “will.” It 
catches hold of it and doesn’t let go: “I won't see him.” But “will” runs 
and gets away time and again: “I will see him.” Everything is forgotten, 
everything, in the struggle of “won't” to suppress “will.” Yes, and the 
big “won't” does suppress the little “will.” Then it summons to its aid 
another small word, so that “will” has nowhere to run and hide: “No, I 
won't see him. . . .No, I won't.” Yes indeed, now these words grab hold 
of that fickle little “will.” There’s no place for it to escape from them. 
They've pinned it down between them: “No, I won’t see him... . No, I 
won't.” But what's this she’s doing? Her hat’s already on; she glances 
into the mirror instinctively. Is her hair in place? Yes, she sees in the 
mirror that she has her hat on. Out of all these words that had 
emerged so forcefully, there remains only “will,” to which is added a 
new phrase, “No going back.” There is no going back, none. “Masha, 
don't wait for me to have dinner. I won't be dining at home today.” 

“Alexander Matveich hasn’t yet returned from the hospital,” said 
Stepan serenely. Indeed, why not be serene, phlegmatic? There was 
nothing peculiar in the fact of her appearance; not so very long ago she 
used to visit here quite often. “I thought that would be the case. Never 
mind, I'll just sit here. Don't tell him I'm here.” She picked up a jour- 
nal. Yes, she could read; she saw that she could. As soon as the phrase 
“No going back” had emerged, as soon as the decision had been made, 
she felt very calm. Of course, she didn’t read very much, in fact, she 
didn't read anything at all. She examined the room and began to put it 


334 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


in order as if she were the mistress of the house. Of course, she didn’t 
rearrange very much; in fact, she didn’t rearrange anything, but she 
felt very calm. She could read as well as find something to do. She 
noticed that an ashtray hadn't been emptied, that the tablecloth need- 
ed adjustment, and that one chair had been left out of place. She sat 
there and thought, “No going back; there’s no other choice. A new life 
is beginning.” She thought that for an hour or two. “A new life is 
beginning. He'll be so surprised and happy. A new life is beginning. 
How fortunate we are.” The bell rings. She blushes a little and smiles. 
Footsteps. The door opens. “Vera Pavlovna!” He staggers. Yes, he actu- 
ally staggers. He reaches for the doorhandle. But she runs to him and 
embraces him: “My dear, oh, my dear! He behaved so nobly; how much 
I love you! I couldn’t live without you!” And then? What happened 
next? How did they get to the other side of the room? She doesn’t 
remember. She remembers only that she ran up to him and kissed 
him; but how they got across the room, she doesn’t remember that, 
nor does he. They remember only how they got around the armchair 
near the table, but as to how they moved away from the door. . . . Yes, 
for several seconds both heads were spinning and their vision was 
blurred as a result of that kiss. 

“Verochka, my angel!” 

“My friend, I couldn’t live without you. You loved me for such a long 
time but kept silent. How noble you are! And how noble he is, Sasha!” 

“Tell me, Verochka, tell me how it happened.” 

“I told him I couldn't live without you. Then, the very next day, 
yesterday in fact, he left. 1 wanted to go after him. All day yesterday I 
thought that I would; but now, you see, I’ve been sitting here for some 
time.” 

“You've lost so much weight during these last two weeks, Verochka. 
Your hands look so pale.” He kisses her hands. 

“Yes, my dear, it was avery difficult struggle. Now! can really appre- 
ciate how much you suffered so as not to disturb my peace. How 
could you control yourself so well that I noticed nothing at all? You 
must have suffered a great deal.” 

“Yes, Verochka, it wasn’t easy,” he says, all the while looking at her 
hands and kissing them. 

She suddenly starts laughing. “Oh, how inconsiderate I am! You 
must be tired, Sasha, and very hungry!” She frees herself from him and 
runs out. 

“Where are you going, Verochka?” 

She makes no reply. She’s gone to the kitchen. Hurriedly, cheertully, 
she says to Stepan, “Serve dinner—for two, as soon as possible. At 
once! Where are the plates and other things? Let me have them. I’ll 


What Is to Be Done? 335 


carry them in and set the table while you bring in the food. Alexander's 
so tired from his work at the hospital that we must serve his dinner 
right away.” She comes in carrying plates on which knives, forks, and 
spoons are rattling. “Ha, ha, ha, my dear! The most urgent concern of 
two lovers at their first meeting is to have their dinner at once! Ha, ha, 
ha!” 

He laughs too as he helps her set the table. He helps a little, but 
hinders more than helps because he keeps on kissing her hands. “Ah, 
Verochka, how pale your hands look!” he says, kissing them again. 

They kiss and laugh. 

“But Sasha, you must sit down at the table and behave yourself.” 

Stepan serves the soup. At dinner she tells him how everything 
happened. “Ha, ha, my dear! How we two lovers eat! The truth is, I 
didn’t eat a thing all day yesterday.” 

Stepan comes in with the last course. 

“Stepan, I'm afraid I haven't left you anything for dinner.” 

“Well, Vera Pavlovna. I'll just have to buy myself something to eat 
from the shop.” 

“Never mind, Stepan. From now on you'll know to prepare enough 
for two besides yourself. Sasha, where's your cigar case? Give it to me.” 
She cuts a cigar and lights it before giving it to him. “Have a smoke, my 
dear, meanwhile I'll go make us some coffee. Or would you prefer tea? 
No, my dear, our dinners must be better. You and Stepan have paid 
them too little attention.” She comes back five minutes later and Step- 
an brings in the tea service. Upon her return she notices that Alex- 
ander’s cigar has gone out. “Ha, ha, my dear. You've been daydreaming 
without me!” He laughs. “Go ahead, smoke!” she says, and lights the 
cigar again. 

Remembering all this, Vera Pavlovna laughs even now. “How prosaic 
our romance was! Our first meeting—and soup; our heads spinning 
from the first kiss—and a hearty appetite! What a love scene! How very 
amusing! Yes, his eyes were shining. Then again, they still shine like 
that. And how many tears dropped onto my hands, which were so 
pale then. They aren’t any longer, of course. In fact, my hands are 
rather beautiful, he’s right about that.” Looking at her hands, Vera 
Pavlovna lowers them to her lap so that they appear under a light 
negligée. Once again she thinks, “He's right about that,” and smiles. 
She slides her hand slowly to her breast and firmly presses it there; 
Vera Pavlovna thinks, “He is right.” 

“Oh, what on earth am I remembering?” Vera Pavlovna keeps on 
thinking and laughing. “What am I doing? As if it were connected to 
these recollections! Oh, no. That first meeting—dinner, the kissing of 
hands, my laughter and his, tears falling on my pale hands—all this 


336 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


was completely original. I sat down to pour tea. ‘Stepan, have you no 
cream? Can't you get us some good cream from somewhere? No, 
there's no time. Probably you can't anyway. So be it. But tomorrow 
we'll get some. Do smoke, my dear, you keep forgetting about your 
cigar.” 

Even before tea was finished the terrible clanging of the bell was 
heard. Two students came flying into the room, failing even to notice 
her in their great haste. “Alexander Matveich! There's a very interesting 
patient!” they cry out, gasping for breath. “They've just brought him in. 
He's got avery rare complication.” Lord knows the Latin term to desig- 
nate the patient’s fascinating disease. “It's very curious, Alexander 
Matveich. Your help’s needed at once! Every moment is critical. We 
even took a cab to get here faster.” 

“Go ahead, dear, hurry up,” she said. It was only then that the 
students noticed her and paid their respects; a moment later they 
swept their professor off with them. It didn’t take him long to get 
ready. He was still wearing his military jacket;215 she hurried him 
along. 

“Will you come over to my place afterward?” she asked as she said 
good-bye. 

“Yes.” 

She waited for a long time that evening. It was ten o'clock and he 
still hadn't returned; then it turned eleven. No need to wait any longer. 
What's this all about? Of course, she wasn't the least bit worried that 
something might have happened to him. But it does show how long he 
was detained by the very interesting patient. What about that poor 
patient? Is he still alive? Did Sasha manage to save him? Yes, indeed, 
Sasha was detained for a very long time. He came back only at nine 
o'clock the following morning, having stayed at the hospital until four 
A.M. 

“It was a very difficult and interesting case, Verochka.” 

“Did you save him?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why did you get up so early?” 

“| haven't been to bed.” 

“You haven't been to bed? You haven't slept all night so as not to be 
late coming here? You heathen! Be so good as to go home at once and 
sleep until dinner, without fail, so that when I arrive I find you still 
asleep.” Two minutes later he was sent packing. 

Such were their first two meetings. But their second dinner together 


215. See n. 109 above. 


What Is to Be Done? 337 


was as it should be. They related their histories to each other in a 
reasonable manner. God knows what they'd said the day before. They 
laughed, grew pensive, and sympathized with each other. Each con- 
sidered that the other must have suffered more. . . . In about a week 
and a half they rented a small dacha on Kamenny Island and settled 
down there.

It's not very often that Vera Pavlovna recalls the past of her new love. 
Yes, there’s so much life in the present that little time remains for 
reminiscences. But when she does recall the past, then sometimes— 
at first, of course, it was only sometimes, but later it was more fre- 
quently—with every reminiscence she felt a certain dissatisfaction. At 
first it was weak, passing, and vague—with whom? at what? Then it 
became clear to her with whom: she was dissatisfied with herself. For 
what? She could already see which trait of her own character this 
dissatisfaction sprang from. Yes, she was very proud. But was she 
dissatisfied with herself only for the past? At first, yes, but lately she’s 
noticed that her dissatisfaction also relates to the present. What how 
strange this feeling seemed when it began to appear; it was as if it were 
not she, Vera Pavlovna Kirsanova, who personally felt this dissatisfac- 
tion; rather, it was as if the dissatisfaction of thousands and millions of 
people were being reflected in her. It was not as if she were dissatisfied 
with herself but that these thousands and millions of people were 
dissatisfied with themselves through her. Who were these thousands 
and millions of people? Why were they dissatisfied? If, as before, she 
were living alone and thinking alone, this feeling would probably not 
have been so evident. But now she was constantly with her husband; 
they thought together all the time, and his presence was mixed in with 
all her other thoughts. This fact helped her considerably to decipher 
her feeling. He himself couldn't explain the riddle directly; as long as 
this feeling was obscure to her, it was even more so to him. He found it 
difficult to conceive how she could feel this discontent that in no way 
darkened her personal satisfaction and didn’t even touch anything 
personal. This was all very strange to him, a hundred times more 
obscure than it was to her. Nevertheless, she was helped considerably 
by the fact that she constantly thought about her husband, was with 
him constantly, looked at him, thought together with him. She began 
to notice that when this feeling of dissatisfaction came upon her, it 
was always accompanied by a comparison; in fact, it consisted of this 


338 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


comparison between her and her husband. Then there flashed before 
her mind the precise word: “difference, an offensive difference.” Now 
she understood. 


Vii. 


“Sasha, how nice that N. N. is.”216 (Vera Pavlovna mentioned the 
name of that officer, the one in her horrible dream through whom she 
wanted to make Tamberlick’s acquaintance).?!7 “He brought me a new 
poem that isn’t likely to be published very soori,”218 said Vera Pavlovna 
at dinner. “We'll read it right after dinner, all right? I waited for you; I 
do everything together with you, Sasha. But I'd really like to read it.” 

“What kind of poem is it?” 

“You'll see. We'll find out whether it’s any good. N. N. says that he—I 
mean the author—is reasonably satisfied with it.” 

They settle down in her room and she begins to read: 


Oh, the little box is brimming over 
With calico and brocade. 

Take pity, my sweetheart, 

On the young man’s shoulder.?!9 


“Now I can see,” said Kirsanov, after hearing several dozen lines, 
“that he’s done it in a new style. But clearly it’s his, Nekrasov's, right? 
I’m very glad you waited for me.” 

“So you should be,” said Vera Pavlovna. They read the short poem 
through twice; thanks to their friendship with one of the author's 
acquaintances, it had come into their hands about three years before it 
was actually published. 

“Do you know which lines affected me the most?” Vera Pavlovna 
asked after she and her husband had read through several passages of 
the poem a few more times. “It’s not the verses in the main section of 
the poem, but others that attracted my attention. It’s when Katya’s 
waiting for her suitor’s return and is pining: 


I would perish, unconsolable, 
If there were time to grieve;

But the time is busy and hurried, 

I must finish up ten different things. 

However often it happens 

That a young married peasant woman 
can no longer endure, still 

The hay falls under the scythe, and 

The rye glitters under the sickle. 

With all her strength and might 

She has threshed in the morning and 

Has spread the flax till dark at night 

Over the dewy meadows.??° 


These lines aren't the main ones in the narrative; they're merely a 
prelude to the part where the worthy-Katya dreams about her life with 
Vanya. But my thoughts are drawn to these verses.” 

“Yes, that scene is one of the best in the poem, even though these 
lines don’t occupy a very prominent place in it. That means they must 
have coincided with your own thoughts. What are they?” 

“Just this, Sasha. You and I have often said that a woman’s constitu- 
tion is all but superior to a man’s; therefore women will most likely 
force men to take a secondary role in intellectual life, once the age of 
brute force has passed.2?! You and I reached this conclusion through 
observation of human life. There one can meet more women than men 
who've been endowed with native intelligence. So it’s seemed to both 
of us. You've even confirmed this conclusion with evidence from anat- 
omy and physiology.” 

“What insulting things you're saying about men. You've gone even 
further than I have, Verochka, and I find it insulting. It’s a good thing 
that the future we both predict is still quite a way off. Or else I'd 
completely reject your opinion so as not to be forced to take a second- 
ary role. Besides, Verochka, this is merely a probability; science has yet 
to collect sufficient data to resolve this question once and for all.” 

“Of course, my dear. We were talking about why it is that so far 
historical facts contradict this conclusion which is so likely, given our 
observation of private life and given the structure of the human organ- 
ism. To the present day women have played a very insignificant role in 
intellectual life because the age of brute force has deprived them of the 
means to develop and of the reasons to strive for development. This 
explanation is sufficient. Yet here's another similar case. Judging by

scientific progress as well as through social revolution.

the amount of physical strength, a woman's organism is much weaker, 
yet it’s more resilient, isn’t that correct?” 

“That point is much less dubious than the question of her natural 
endowment of intellect. Yes, indeed, a woman’s organism is more 
resilient; it can better resist destructive material forces such as climate, 
weather, and unsatisfactory food. Medicine and physiology have paid 
too little attention to a detailed study of this question up to now, but 
Statistics have already provided an indisputable general answer. The 
average life expectancy of a woman is greater than that of a man. From 
this it’s obvious that the female organism is more resilient.” 

“It’s even more obvious considering the fact that, in general, a wom- 
an’s way of life is still much less healthy than a man’s.” 

“There’s additional evidence provided by physiology to support 
your conclusion. A woman reaches her full maturity somewhat earlier 
than a man. Let's assume that a woman’s growth ends at about age 
twenty; a man’s ends at about twenty-five, given our climate and our 
race. And let’s assume, also approximately, that the same proportion 
of women live until the age of seventy as men live until sixty-five. If we 
consider the difference in periods of development, the preponderance 
of resilience in the female organism appears much stronger than even 
statistics would demonstrate, not taking into consideration the differ- 
ence in their ages of maturity. Seventy years is three and a half times 
twenty. Sixty-five years must be divided by twenty-five. How much is 
that? Why, a little more than two and a half times—yes, two and six- 
tenths. In other words, a woman lives three and a half times her age of 
maturity while a man lives only two and a half times his. The resilience 
of her organism can therefore be measured by this proportion.” 

“Indeed, the difference is greater than I had assumed from my read- 
ing.” 

“Yes, but I chose merely two examples and used approximate fig- 
ures, speaking from memory. However, the thrust of the conclusion is 
much the same as I've indicated. Statistics have already demonstrated 
that the female organism is more resilient. You've read these conclu- 
sions only in life-expectancy tables. If you add physiological evidence 
to the statistical data, then the difference emerges as much greater.” 

“That’s so, Sasha. Then consider what I've been thinking, since now 
it seems even clearer to me. I've been thinking that if the female organ- 
ism endures destructive material forces with greater resilience, then 
it’s very likely that she should find it easier to survive moral distress as 
well. But in fact, that’s not what we see.” 

“Yes, that conclusion is likely. Of course, it’s still only a hypothesis; 
it’s yet to be studied and special facts have yet to be collected. How- 
ever, your conclusion emerges so closely from indisputable facts that

it’s difficult to question it. The resilience of the organism is very closely 
connected with the strength of the nervous system. It’s most likely that 
a woman’s nerves are more elastic and more durable; if that’s so, they 
ought to tolerate distress and painful feelings with greater ease and 
endurance. In practice, we see all too many examples of the opposite. 
A woman is frequently tormented by something that a man can bear 
quite easily. Science has yet to analyze thoroughly the reasons why, 
given our historical situation, we can observe phenomena that contra- 
dict what should be expected from the structure of the organism itself. 
One reason is obvious; it pervades all historical phenomena and all 
aspects of contemporary existence. That’s the strength of prejudice, 
bad habit, false expectation, and false fear. If a person thinks, ‘I can't,’ 
then he really can't. Women have been told, ‘You're weak.’ Therefore, 
they feel weak and really turn out to be so. You know examples when 
perfectly healthy people have wasted away and died as a result of the 
idea that they were supposed to grow weak and die. There are similar 
examples that affect whole masses of people, nations, humanity. Mili- 
tary history presents us with one of the most striking of these. During 
the Middle Ages the infantry imagined that it couldn’t stand up 
against the cavalry, and so it really couldn’t. Whole armies of infantry- 
men were dispersed like flocks of sheep by a few hundred riders until 
the English infantry appeared on the Continent. It consisted of proud, 
independent, small landowners who had no fear and who yielded to 
no one without a fight. As soon as these men, lacking the belief that 
they should flee in the face of cavalrymen, arrived in France, a cavalry 
that greatly outnumbered them was defeated at every engagement. 
You recall the famous defeat ofthe French cavalry by the small army of 
English infantrymen at Crécy, Poitiers, and Agincourt.222 The same 
story was repeated when the Swiss infantry decided that there was 
absolutely no reason for them to consider themselves weaker than the 
feudal cavalry. The Austrians, and later the Burgundian cavalry, much 
more numerous, began to suffer defeat at their hands at every engage- 
ment.2?3 Then all the other cavalries tried to do battle with them; they 


222. In their efforts to gain control over northern and western France during the 
Hundred Years’ War of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the English kings Edward 
If (r. 1327-1377) and Henry V (r. 1413-1422) used English longbowmen with devastating 
effect to defeat the armor-laden aristocratic cavalry of their French opponents at the 
battles of Crécy (1346), Poitiers (1356), and Agincourt (1415). See also n. 223 below. 

223. In defending their autonomy against Habsburg pretensions in the fourteenth 
century and Burgundian claims in the fifteenth, the infantry of the recently confede- 
rated Swiss cantons used halberds (eight-foot axes) and pikes wielded in tight forma- 
tions to decimate their opponents’ cavalry, made up predominantly of noblemen. Cher- 
nyshevsky is suggesting that the social origin and presumed economic independence of 
the English bowmen and Swiss pikemen gave them the courage to vanquish their 
aristocratic foes. 


342 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


were all constantly defeated. At that point everyone realized that ‘in- 
fantry was stronger than calvary,’ and of course it was. Yet whole 
centuries had passed when the infantry was very weak compared to 
the cavalry, merely because it considered itself so.” 

“Yes, Sasha, that’s true. We are weak because we consider ourselves 
so. But it seems to me that there’s another reason. I want to talk about 
myself and about you. Tell me, my dear, did I change very much 
during the two weeks you didn’t see me? You were so upset. The 
change might have seemed greater than it was; or was it really so 
great? How do you recall it now?” 

“Yes, you really were quite pale and thin then.” 

“You see, my dear, I now realize that it’s precisely this that irritates 
my pride. You loved me very deeply. Why wasn't that struggle reflected 
in you with obvious symptoms? No one noticed that you'd grown pale 
or thin during those months after we separated. Why did you endure 
it so easily?” 

“So that’s why those verses about Katya’s overcoming her grief 
through work made such an impression on you! You want to know 
whether I myself have ever experienced the truth of this observation. 
Yes, it’s entirely justified. I endured the struggle so easily because I 
had no time for it. When I did pay attention to it, I suffered a great deal; 
but daily necessity compelled me to forget all about it most of the time. 
I had to take care of my patients and prepare for my lectures. During 
this time, like it or not, I had some unwilling respite from my thoughts. 
On those rare days when I had a few hours to spare, I felt as if my 
strength were failing me. I think that if I'd had to spend a week alone 
with my thoughts, I would have gone mad.” 

“Absolutely, my dear. I've just realized that that’s the whole secret of 
the difference between you and me. A person must have the kind of 
work that can be neither neglected nor postponed. Then a person is 
incomparably stronger.” 

“But you had lots of work to do then, just as you do now.” 

“Ah, Sasha, is my work really so pressing? I attend to it whenever I 
want, as much as | want. If I feel like it, I can cut it very short or 
postpone it altogether. To pay attention to work when my thoughts 
are in turmoil requires special willpower; only that could force me to 
work. I find no support in necessity. For example: I run the household 
and spend a great deal of time on it. But nine-tenths of the time I 
spend in this way is of my own choosing. With a competent servant 
wouldn't everything go almost as well as it does now even if I spent 
much less time at it myself? So who needs it, if, with a larger expendi- 
ture of my time, things go just a little bit better than if I were to spend 
much less time at it? The need exists only in my desire. When your 


What Is to Be Done? 343 


thoughts are at peace, you attend to these concerns; when they're in 
turmoil, you toss these things aside because you can get along without 
them. You always throw over less important things for more important 
ones. As soon as your feelings are roused, they drive away all thoughts 
of such things. I also give lessons; these are somewhat more impor- 
tant. I can’t discard them at will. But even so, it’s still right. I attend to 
them only when I want to. Even if I pay less attention during the 
course of a lesson, it’s only a little less effective since teaching is too 
easy for me and fails to engage my mind. Besides, do I really earn my 
living through these lessons? Does my position really depend on 
them? Do they provide the principal means of support for my way of 
life? No, before it was Dmitry’s work, and nowit'’s yours that provides 
me with those means. Lessons flatter my feeling of independence and 
are by no means useless. Nevertheless, they entail no vital necessity for 
me. I tried to drive away thoughts that were tormenting me by spend- 
ing more time than usual in the workshop. But once again I did it only 
by strength of will. I understood that my presence there was needed 
only for an hour or so, and that if I stayed any longer I was occupying 
myself with some artificial task, useful but by no means essential to the 
enterprise. Besides, could the enterprise in and of itself really serve as 
an important support for ordinary people such as me? The Rakhme- 
tovs are a different breed. They identify with the common cause??* to 
such an extent that it becomes their own necessity, filling their lives. It 
even comes to replace their personal life. But that’s beyond us, Sasha. 
We're not eagles, like he is. Personal life is the only thing that’s indis- 
pensable to us. Is the workshop really a part of my personal life? It’s a 
cause, not my own, but someone else’s. I work at it not for myself but 
for others, though perhaps also from my own convictions. But can 
ordinary people such as we are—not eagles—can we really be con- 
cerned about others when were in distress? Can we really be oc- 
cupied by convictions when we're being tormented by feelings? No, 
we need a personal cause, one our life depends on, a cause that for me 
personally, for my way of life, for my own means, for my whole posi- 
tion, for my entire fate would be more important than all the impulses 
of my passion. Only such a cause could serve as a support in the 
struggle against passion; only such a cause would not be forced out of 
life by passion, but would itself suppress all passion. Only such a 
cause would provide both strength and rest. I want such a cause.” 

“Just so, my friend, indeed,” said Kirsanov warmly, kissing his wife, 
whose eyes were sparkling with animation. “Absolutely. I never

common cause” was a euphemism for revolution.

thought about it until now, but it’s so very simple. I never noticed it 
before. Yes, Verochka, no one can think for another person. If you want 
to lead a good life, then think for yourself, look out for yourself, be- 
cause no one can do it for you. To love you as I do, yet not understand 
it until you explained it to me! But,” he continued, laughing now and 
still kissing his wife, “why do you see this need now? Do you plan to 
fall in love with someone else, Verochka? Is that it?” 

Vera Pavlovna burst into laughter, and the two of them could say 
nothing for some time as a result of their mirth. 

“Yes, now we can both experience this,” she began at last. “Now I 
know for sure, and so do you, that nothing of that sort can occur to 
either of us. But seriously, do you know what I think now, my dear? If 
my love for Dmitry was not that of a fully developed person, then he 
really didn’t love me in the way you and I understand the meaning of 
that word. His feeling was a combination of very strong affection for 
me as a friend and fleeting bursts of passion toward me as a woman. 
He felt a personal friendship for me, for me in particular; but these 
bursts of passion were directed at women in general. They had little 
relation to me, to me personally. No, that wasn't love. Was he ever 
preoccupied with thoughts of me? No, he wasn’t. On his side, just as 
on mine, there was no real love.” 

“You're being unfair to him, Verochka.” 

“No, Sasha, it’s true. There’s no point in our singing his praises. We 
both know how much we respect him; we also know that no matter 
how easy he said it was for him, it really wasn’t. Why, you too said that 
you found it easy to struggle against your passion. That's just splen- 
did, and not made up, but one shouldn't take such repeated assur- 
ances literally. Oh, my friend, I understand how you suffered. . . . This 
is how strongly I feel it... .” 

“Verochka, you'll strangle me. Now confess, in addition to your 
strength of feeling, you also wanted to show me your physical 
strength? Yes, you're very strong. And with a chest like that, how could 
you be anything but...” 

“My dear Sasha.” 


Vili. 


“Sasha, you didn’t even let me get to what I wanted to talk about,” 
Vera Pavlovna began some two hours later, when they sat down to tea. 

“T didn’t let you? Am I to blame?” 

“Of course you are.” 

“And who started fooling around?” 


What Is to Be Done? 345 


“Well, aren’t you ashamed?” 

“Of what?” 

“That it was I who started fooling around. Fie! To compromise a 
modest woman so by your indifference.”225 

“Indeed? And IJ thought that you preached equality. If that’s true, 
then there’s equality of initiative.” 

“Ha, ha, ha! What learned talk! Are you really accusing me of il- 
logicality?22® Don't I try to maintain equality of initiative as well? Well, 
Sasha, now I'm taking the initiative in resuming the serious conversa- 
tion that we interrupted.” 

“Take it, but I refuse to follow your lead. Now I'll take the initiative 
and continue to interrupt. Give me your hand.” 

“But Sasha, we must finish talking.” 

“We'll have time for that tomorrow. Right now, as you see, I'm much 
too interested in investigating this hand.” 


ix. 


“Sasha, let’s finish the discussion we interrupted yesterday. It’s im- 
portant because I’m planning to go with you and you must know 
why,” said Vera Pavlovna the next morning. 

“With me? Youre going with me?” 

“Of course. You asked me, Sasha, why I needed a cause that my life 
could seriously hinge on, one that I'd value as much as you value your 
life’s work, one that would be just as demanding and would require as 
much attention from me as yours does from you. My dear, I need such 
a cause because I'm so very proud. For some time I've been burdened 
and embarrassed by the memory that my emotional struggle was so 
obvious and unendurable. You know I'm not talking about how painful 
it was; your struggle wasn’t very easy for you to bear, either. That all 
depends on the strength of the feeling, and I musn't regret now that 
the struggle was so painful, since that would also mean regretting that 
the feeling was so strong. No! But why did I lack the firm support that 
you possess to resist the strength of that feeling? I want such a sup- 
port, too. This merely suggested an idea to me, but of course the 
genuine need also exists. I want to be equal to you in all respects: 
that’s the main thing. I've found my cause. After I said good-bye to you 
yesterday, I thought about it for a long time and got the idea yesterday

the superficiality and transience of passionate love.

morning, without you. I wanted to confer with you yesterday as with a 
good friend, but you betrayed my confidence in your reliability. Now 
it's too late for consultations: I’ve made my decision. Yes, Sasha, you'll 
have to go to a great deal of trouble for me; we'll be so happy, my dear, 
if I’m sure I'm capable of it!” 

Yes, now Vera Pavlovna has found her life’s work, one she could 
never have conceived of before. Her Alexander’s hand would con- 
stantly be in hers; therefore, her path would be easy. Lopukhov had in 
no way hindered her, or she him, but that was that. No, there was 
more than that, of course, much more. She always felt sure, whenever 
she needed his support, that his arm, together with his head, would 
always be at her disposal. But only together with his head. Lopukhov 
didn't begrudge offering her his head, just as he did his arm, that is, on 
important matters and at critical moments his arm and his head were 
just as available and reliable as Kirsanov’s.227 He’d shown this all too 
well by the marriage when he sacrificed for her all his cherished 
notions of a scholarly career and wasn't afraid to risk going hungry. 
Yes, when the matter was important, Lopukhov's arm was offered. But 
this arm was generally rather distant. Vera Pavlovna was organizing 
her workshop. Had she needed his help in any way, he'd have given it 
gladly. But why had he done so little? He’d merely refrained from 
interfering; he approved and rejoiced. He had his own life and she had 
hers. 

Now it was different. Kirsanov didn’t wait to be asked to participate 
in everything she did. He was as interested as she was in her everyday 
life, just as she was in his. She had an entirely different relationship 
than that with her first husband; consequently she felt as if she had 
new sources of activity. Thoughts began to arise within her and as- 
sume a practical necessity that had been known to her on a theoretical 
level but had never really affected her inner life. What one can’t do, one 
doesn't even contemplate seriously. 

The following ideas were those that Vera Pavlovna now began to 
consider actively and that served as the motivation for her activity. 


X. 


“Almost all paths of civil life are formally closed to women. Many, 
almost all, are closed to us in practice, even those paths of social 


227. Although the text here reads “Lopukhov,” Chernyshevsky obviously meant Kir- 
sanov. He also is alluding to the readiness of both characters, and of the “new men” in 
general, to undertake revolutionary activity. 


What Is to Be Done? 347 


activity not barred by formal obstacles. Of all spheres of life we are 
crowded into only one, family life: to be a member of a family, and 
that’s all. Besides this, what other occupations are open to women? 
Perhaps only that of governess or tutor, if men are kind enough to 
leave us anything. This single path is very crowded; we get in one 
another's way because there are too many of us. This way can scarcely 
provide us with independence because there are too many of us offer- 
ing our services. No single one of us is ever needed simply because 
there are too many available. Who really values governesses? You need 
only advertise that you're looking for one and dozens of us, hundreds 
of us arrive, each trying to get the place away from the others. 

“No, until women strive to branch out in different ways, they'll never 
enjoy independence. Of course, it's difficult to forge a new path. But in 
this respect I'm in a particularly advantageous situation. I should be 
ashamed not to make use of it. Women haven't been prepared for 
serious pursuits. I don’t know how much help I need to prepare 
myself, but I do know that no matter how much I need his daily help, 
he'll be here with me. Nor will this be a burden for him; it'll be as 
enjoyable for him as it will for me. 

“Many paths of independent activity that haven't been closed to us 
by law are barred by social custom. But of those paths, I can embark 
on any one I choose, as long as I’ve resolved to endure the initial 
opposition of social convention. One such path is considerably more 
familiar to me than all others. My husband is a doctor. Since he spends 
all his free time with me, it should be easy for me to attempt to become 
a doctor, too. 

“It’s very important indeed to have women doctors.?28 They would 
prove very useful to all women. It’s much easier for a woman to talk to 
another woman than to a man. How much unhappiness, suffering, 
and death could be avoided! I must try!”

Vera Pavlovna finished this conversation with her husband by put- 
ting on her hat and accompanying him to the hospital to test her 
nerve. Could she stand the sight of blood and would she be able to 


228. Medicine provided one of the few, and socially most prominent, careers open to 
Russian women during the late imperial period. They began to audit medical courses at 
several Russian universities and at the Medical-Surgical Academy in the early 1860s. 
Barred from this practice by the government in 1863, many Russian women continued 
their studies in Switzerland, where they often became politically radicalized. In 1872, 
partly in response to this development, the tsarist government once again permitted 
women to study medicine at some Russian institutes of higher education. 


348 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


study anatomy? Given Kirsanov’s position in the hospital, there were, 
of course, no obstacles to her undertaking such an experiment. 


Without feeling the least bit ashamed, I’ve compromised Vera Pav- 
lovna many times from a poetical standpoint. For example, I haven't 
concealed the fact that she dines every day, generally with a hearty 
appetite, and besides that, she takes tea twice a day. But now I've 
reached a point where, despite the shameless depravity of my concep- 
tions, I'm beset by timidity and begin to wonder, “Might it not be better 
to hide this? What will people think of a woman who proves to be 
capable of studying medicine? She must have both coarse nerves and 
a hard heart! She’s not really a woman, but a butcher!” Considering, 
however, that I haven't been presenting my characters as ideals of 
perfection, I calm down. Let people judge as they please the coarse- 
ness of Vera Pavlovna’s nature. What do I care? Is she coarse? So be it. 

Therefore I can declare very coldbloodedly that she’s discovered an 
enormous difference between idle observation and active work, both 
for her own good and for the sake of others. 

I remember how frightened I was when, as a twelve-year-old child 
who'd never seen a fire, 1 was suddenly awakened by the very loud 
noise of a general fire alarm. The whole sky was ablaze and scorching 
hot; charred logs were flying through the air of our large provincial 
town; there was a terrible uproar, much running about, and very loud 
shouting. I shook feverishly. Fortunately I managed to get to the fire, 
taking advantage of the fact that everyone at home was in a state of 
great confusion. The fire was moving along the embankment (that is, 
along the shore. . . there wasn’t really an embankment). The shore was 
piled with firewood and bast;222 young children my own age grabbed 
hold of these things and dragged them away from the burning houses. 
I took part, too. What had become of my fear? I worked very diligently 
until we were told: “Enough! The danger’s passed.” From that time on 
I knew that if one is afraid of a large fire, then one must run toward it 
and work very hard; one will no longer be afraid. 

He who works has no time to be afraid or to feel revulsion or disgust. 

And so Vera Pavlovna took up medicine. She was one of the first 
women of my acquaintance who began to work in this new area. As 
she did this she really began to feel herself becoming a different per- 
son. She thought, “In a few years I'll be able to stand on my own two 
feet.” That's a splendid thought! There’s no real happiness without 
total independence. Poor women! There are so few of you who experi- 
ence this happiness!

And so a year goes by; another year will pass, then a third, since her 
marriage to Kirsanov, and Vera Pavlovna’s days will continue to pass as 
they do now only one year after her wedding, as they have since the 
wedding itself. Many years will go by in the same way, unless some- 
thing special occurs. Who knows what the future holds? But up to the 
time I write these lines, nothing like that has happened; Vera Pavlov- 
na’s days pass just as they did then, a year or two after her marriage to 
Kirsanov. 

After relaying the terribly compromising information about Vera 
Pavlovna’s plan to study medicine and her ability to do so, it’s easy for 
me to talk about anything now. Nothing else could harm her as much 
in the public’s estimation. I must say that now on Sergievsky Street, 
just as previously on Vasilievsky Island, Vera’s day is punctuated by 
three meals: morning tea, dinner, and evening tea. Yes, she’s main- 
tained her unpoetic habit of dining every day and taking tea twice a 
day. Moreover, she even finds this enjoyable. In fact, she’s maintained 
all her unpoetic, unrefined, and unseemly habits. 

Many other things in this new tranquil period have remained as 
they were in the previous one. The division of rooms into neutral and 
nonneutral space is the same, as well as the rule not to enter each 
other’s nonneutral space without permission. The rule also remains in 
force not to repeat a question if, in reply to the first time it was posed, a 
person is told, “Don't ask.” They agree that such an answer shouldn't 
inspire any further thought about that question; rather the question 
should be forgotten. They remain convinced that if a question de- 
served an answer, there would be no need to ask it, since everything 
would have been made perfectly clear without any questions, and the 
fact that a person is silent shouldn’t mean anything in particular. All 
this remains the same in this new serene period, just as it was before. 
However, now, in the new serene period, everything is slightly altered, 
no, not altered, but not quite the same as it was before, and their life is 
really quite different. 

For example, the neutral and nonneutral rooms are strictly divided, 
but permission to enter a nonneutral room at a certain time of day has 
been granted once and for all. That’s because two of their three daily 
meals have been moved to nonneutral rooms. They customarily have 
morning tea in her room and evening tea in his. Evening tea is con- 
ducted without any special ceremony. The servant, still the same Ste- 
pan, brings the samovar and tea service into Alexander's room, and 
that’s all. But with morning tea there’s now a special procedure. Ste- 
pan places the samovar and tea service on a table in the neutral space 


350 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


closest to Vera Paviovna’s room; then he tells Alexander Matviech that 
tea is served, that is, if he finds Alexander Matveich in his own study. 
And if he doesn’t? Then Stepan has no need to announce it; let them 
remember that it’s time for tea. So, in accordance with this custom, 
they've made a rule that every morning Vera Pavlovna waits for her 
husband without his having to ask permission to enter. She really can't 
manage without her Sasha. Everyone will understand why as soon as I 
describe how she wakes up. 

Upon awakening she luxuriates in her warm bed; too lazy to get up, 
she lies there thinking and not thinking, dozing and not dozing. If 
she’s thinking, then it’s about something related to that day or the next 
few days, or something connected to the household, the workshop, 
her acquaintances, plans, or else how to organize her day—in other 
words, she’s not dozing. But in addition, there are two other con- 
siderations: and three years after her marriage there appeared still a 
third, which is now nestled in her arms, Mitya, named after her friend 
Dmitry, of course.2°° And those two other considerations are, first, the 
pleasant thought that her career now provides her with complete 
independence in life, and second, her Sasha. This latter couldn't even 
be called a special consideration, since it was part and parcel of every- 
thing she thought about because he participated in her entire life. 
When this idea, not a very special one but an ever-present one, stands 
alone in her mind (it very often and at great length does so), what 
should one call it? Is it a thought or a daydream? Is she asleep or 
awake? Her eyes are half-closed, her cheeks slightly flushed, as in 
sleep. Yes, she is dozing. Now you can see for yourself why very often 
time passes so quickly that Vera Pavlovna hardly has time to get up 
and take a bath. (This has been conveniently arranged and took con- 
siderable effort. It was necessary to run pipes from the kitchen faucet 
and the boiler into her room. And, to tell the truth, rather a great deal 
of firewood is expended on this luxury. But what of it? She can allow 
herself this extravagance now.) Yes, very often Vera Pavlovna manages 
to take a bath and then lie down again to rest, lounging until Sasha’s 
arrival. Frequently, perhaps even more often, she lies there daydream- 
ing and half-dozing, without having decided to bathe, when Sasha 
comes in. 

How nice it is to take a bath every morning! At first the water is so 
very hot, then the hot’s turned off, the other faucet’s turned on, and 
the cold water starts to trickle in. Slowly, imperceptibly, the water in 
the bath begins to cool. How splendid! A half hour, sometimes more, 


230. That is, Lopukhov. 


What Is to Be Done? 351 


sometimes a whole hour goes by, and still she doesn’t want to leave 
her bath. 

Then, all on her own, without a servant, she gets dressed. It’s much 
nicer that way. All on her own, that is, unless she’s dozed the time 
away. And if she has? Then there’s no way to escape it! Escape from 
what? From Sasha’s playing the role of maid. Sasha’s awfully funny! 
Perhaps not even the mysterious touch of the whispering guest-sing- 
er’s hand?3! could force the words “This is so embarrassing” to appear 
in her imaginary diary. In any case, her sweetheart takes upon himself 
the established duty of attending to morning tea. 

There really was no other way. Sasha was absolutely right when he 
said that it should be so organized, because it was very pleasant to 
have one’s morning tea, that is, mostly cream warmed by the addition 
of a small amount of very strong tea, in bed. Sasha would fetch the tea 
service. Yes, that occurred more often than his having to come in with 
it,232 and he would officiate while she lounged in bed. After drinking 
her fill, she’d continue to recline, now no longer in bed, but on her 
little sofa. It was so wide, but most of all it was very soft, almost like a 
featherbed. She’d rest until ten or eleven o’clock, when Sasha had to 
leave for the hospital, the clinic, or the academic auditorium. Over his 
last cup of tea Sasha would light up a cigar and one of them would 
remark to the other, “Let’s get to work,” or “Enough of this. Now to 
work.” What kind of work? A lesson or review session for Vera Pavlovna, 
of course. Sasha is her medical tutor, but his help is needed even more 
to prepare her for examinations in those subjects in the gymnasium 
course which she found too tedious to study alone. A really awful one 
was mathematics; Latin was almost as tedious, but there was no 
choice. She had to suffer with both, but not too much. The examina- 
tion to replace a gymnasium certificate for entrance into the Medical 
Academy really required little, very little. For example, I can’t guaran- 
tee that Vera Pavlovna will ever be proficient enough in Latin to be able 
to translate even two lines of Cornelius Nepos,233 but she can already 
understand the Latin phrases that occur in medical books, because 


231. See pp. 236—43 above. 

232. An indication that, while Vera Pavlovna and Kirsanov preserved their indepen- 
dence, their mutual love and passionate natures led them generally to sleep together. 
Through this intimate relationship Chernyshevsky demonstrates how the rational satis- 
faction of personal desires in fact binds individuals together more closely. 

233. A Roman historian and a correspondent and friend of Cicero, Cornelius Nepos (c. 
100 B.c.—c. 25 B.c.) is noted particularly for his biographies of Atticus, Cicero, and the 
elder Cato. Chernyshevsky echoes a criticism often made by liberals and radicals, that 
the emphasis on classical studies in tsarist gymnasia ill prepared students for the 
modern world.

this knowledge is essential for her, though not very profound. No, 
enough of this. I see that I’m compromising Vera Pavlovna beyond 
belief. No doubt the perspica... 


xiii. A Digression On Bluestockings?#+ 


“A bluestocking! An extreme example of a bluestocking! I can’t stand 
a bluestocking! Stupid and boring is the bluestocking!” cries the per- 
spicacious reader with considerable heat, not all unwarranted. 

My, how attached we've become, the perspicacious reader and I. He 
insulted me, I threw him out on his ear twice, and still we go on 
exchanging our innermost thoughts. A secret attraction of hearts! 
What can we do about it? 

“O perspicacious reader,” I reply, “you're right. A bluestocking is 
genuinely stupid and boring, and impossible to bear. You guessed it. 
But you haven't figured out who the bluestocking is. You'll see soon, as 
if in a mirror. A bluestocking holds forth self-confidently and with 
unreasonable affectation about literature and other learned things 
about which he knows absolutely nothing. He does so not because he 
has any interest in these matters, but merely to show off his intelli- 
gence (which, as it happens, he did not receive from nature), his sub- 
lime aspirations (of which he has as many as the chair on which he 
sits), and his education (of which he has as much as a parrot). Do you 
see whose ugly mug and sleek figure are reflected in that mirror? 
Yours, my friend! Yes, however much you grow your beard or however 
carefully you shave it off, you're still undoubtedly and indisputably a 
genuine bluestocking. That’s why I tossed you out on your ear twice, 
merely because I can’t stand bluestockings, a type ten times more 
prevalent among my fellow men than among women. 

“Anyone who is purposefully engaged in some kind of work, no 
matter what, and no matter what kind of clothes this person wears, 
men’s or women’s, that person is simply someone engaged in his 
work. That’s all there is to it.” 


xiv. 


This conversation about bluestockings has been very useful for the 
perspicacious reader (who is one himself), but it’s taken me away from 


234. A term originating in late-eighteenth-century England which indicated a woman 
who departed from social convention because of her strong literary tastes and learning. 


What Is to Be Done? 353 


my account of how Vera Pavlovna spends her days now. “Now’”—what 
does that mean? Whatever you like, from the time she moved to Ser- 
gievsky Street to the present. But, as a maiter of fact, why continue this 
description? Merely to indicate that the change that had begun to 
affect the tenor of Vera Pavlovna’s evenings ever since she renewed her 
acquaintance with Kirsanov on Vasilievsky Island had so evolved that 
now the Kirsanovs constituted the center of a rather large circle of 
young families living as harmoniously and happily as they do, and 
according to the same ideas. Music and singing, opera and poetry, 
parties and dances fill the spare evenings of these families because 
every evening there’s a gathering at the home of one or another of 
them or an event arranged elsewhere for those who wish. Usually 
about half the entire circle is in attendance at these gatherings and at 
other occasions; the Kirsanovs, like the others, spend about half their 
evenings in this animated way. There's no more to say about it; it’s all 
very clear. There’s one thing, however, that unfortunately is all too 
deserving of detailed comment if many people are to understand it. 
Each one of us, even if he hasn't experienced it but just read about it, 
knows the difference for a young man or woman between an evening 
that is simply that and an evening spent with a sweetheart, between 
an opera you simply enjoy and one that you attend in the company of 
your beloved. There’s a very big difference indeed. That’s well known. 
But what’s experienced by very few is the fact that the fascination that 
love imparts need not be a momentary phenomenon in a person’s life. 
This bright light of our life need not illuminate merely the period of 
search and aspiration which we can simply call courtship or wooing. 
No, this period should really be only the dawning, gentle and beautiful 
in and of itself, but merely the harbinger of a day that shines with 
incomparably more light and warmth than the dawn. Its light and 
warmth will grow and grow, especially the warmth, and will keep on 
growing long past noon. This wasn’t always so. Often when lovers 
were united, the poetry of their love would quickly disappear. Now, 
among those who are called “contemporary people,’2*5 it’s not like 
that at all. After they unite their love, the longer they live together, the 
more they're illuminated and warmed by its poetry, until the end of 
the day, when their solicitude for their growing children will engulf all 
other concerns. Then this solicitude, much sweeter than personal 
enjoyment alone, takes precedence; but up to that time the personal 
enjoyment keeps growing. What people used to experience for only a 
few fleeting months contemporary people manage to preserve for 
many, many years. 


235. That is, the “new people.” 


354 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Why is this so? It’s a secret, but I suppose I can reveal it to you. It’s a 
fine secret, easily applied and not difficult to use, but one must have 
both a pure heart and an honest soul, as well as a contemporary 
notion of the rights of man and respect for the freedom of the individ- 
ual you live with. That's all. It's no more a secret than that. Regard your 
wife as you did your bride; recognize that at any moment she has the 
right to say, “I’m dissatisfied with you. Get away from me.” Regard her 
thus and nine years after your marriage she'll still inspire in you the 
same poetic feeling she did as a bride; no, it will be even more poetic 
and more ideal in the good sense of that word. Acknowledge her 
freedom just as openly and formally, with no reservations, as you 
recognize your friends’ rights to value or spurn your friendship. Then, 
ten years or even twenty after your marriage, you'll be just as dear to 
her as you were when you were a bridegroom. That's how contempo- 
rary men and women live today. An enviable situation! That's because 
they're completely honest with each other; ten years after their mar- 
riage they love each other more passionately and poetically than they 
did on their wedding day. During those ten years neither has ever 
given the other a false kiss or uttered a false word. “A lie has never 
crossed his lips” was written about a character in a certain book. 
“There's no falsehood in his heart” was also said about a character in a 
certain book, perhaps the same one226 People read that book and 
think, “What astonishing moral virtue is ascribed to him!” Those who 
wrote that book thought, “We've described the sort of person who'll 
surprise everyone.” Those who wrote it didn't foresee, and those who 
read it don't understand, that contemporary people don’t admit into 
their circle of acquaintances anyone who doesn't possess such a soul. 
They have no lack of friends whom they consider nothing more than 
contemporary people, worthy but very ordinary. 

There's but one regret: at the present time, for every contemporary 
person there are at least a dozen or more antediluvian types. It’s only 
natural, after all, that the antediluvian world should be populated by 
antediluvians. 


XV. 
“We've been living together three years now” (before it used to be 
one year, then two, soon it'll be four and so on), “yet we still act like 
lovers who see each other infrequently and secretly. Where did people 


come up with the idea, Sasha, that love fades when nothing really 


236. The source of these quotations is unknown. 


What Is to Be Done? 355 


prevents people from belonging entirely to one another? These people 
didn’t know true love, only erotic self-love or fantasy. Real love begins 
only when people begin to live together.” 

“Could it be that you've noticed something of this kind in me?” 

“I've noticed something much more curious than that. In another 
three years you'll forget all about your medicine; three years after that 
you'll forget how to read. Of all your faculties pertaining to intellectual 
life, only one will remain—your vision, and even then you'll forget how 
to see anything else but me.” 

Such conversations didn’t last very long and didn’t occur too fre- 
quently, but still they did take place. 

“Yes, love grows stronger each year.” 

“Have you heard those tales about the opium eaters? Their passion 
increases every year. Someone who's once tasted the delight that pas- 
sion offers can only go on to experience it to a greater and greater 
degree.” 

“Yes. All strong passions are like that; the more they develop, the 
stronger they grow.” 

“Satiety! Passion doesn’t know satiety; it knows only temporary re- 
lief.” 

“Only idle fantasy knows satiety, not the heart or the real, vital 
person, only the spoiled dreamer who's retreated from life.” 

“As if my appetite were weakened or my taste dulled because I don’t 
starve myself, but instead have no trouble eating very well every day. 
On the contrary, my taste develops because my table has so much to 
offer. I'd lose my appetite only with life itself; one can't live without it.” 
(This is clearly gross materialism, I observe together with the per- 
spicacious reader.) 

“Can human nature provide for an attachment to grow weaker, for it 
not to develop with time? When is friendship better and sweeter—a 
week, a year, or twenty years after it began? It’s essential that people 
choose well so that they're really suited to be friends with each other.” 

These conversations are perpetual, but occur not too often. They're 
brief and infrequent. Indeed, why talk about this a great deal or very 
often? 


The following kind of conversation, however, occurred more fre- 
quently and lasted longer. 

“Sasha, what a great support your love is to me. Through it I’m 
becoming independent and casting off all reliance, even on you, yes, 
even on you. But what has my love brought to you?” 

“Me? No less than to you. It gives my nerves a strong, constant, 
healthy stimulus that inevitably leads to the development of my entire 


356 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


nervous system.” (Gross materialism, I observe once again, together 
with the perspicacious reader.) “Therefore, both my intellectual and 
moral strength grow as a result of my love.” 

“Yes, Sasha, I hear this from everybody. I’m a poor witness since my 
own eyes are partial. But everyone else sees it: your eyes sparkle and 
your gaze is stronger and sharper.” 

“Verochka, why shouldn't I praise myself or not praise myself in 
front of you? We're now one person, and this must indeed be reflected 
in one’s eyes. My intellect has become stronger. When I drawa conclu- 
sion from observations, or prepare a general survey of facts, I can now 
do in one hour what used to take me several hours of work. Now I can 
grasp far more facts than before; my conclusions are broader and 
fuller. Verochka, if there'd been a spark of brilliance in me, then with 
this new feeling I would have become a great genius. If I'd been en- 
dowed by nature with the strength to make some small innovation in 
science, with this feeling I would have acquired the power to revolu- 
tionize all of science. But I was born to be merely a drudge, an obscure 
insignificant laborer, one who works on minor, particular problems. 
That’s the way I was even before you appeared. But now, you know, 
I’m no longer the same person. People have begun to expect more of 
me; they think I’m reorganizing one entire important branch of sci- 
ence, the theory of the function of the nervous system. Now I feel that 
I'll fulfill their expectations. At the age of twenty-four a man’s outlook 
is broader and bolder than at twenty-nine” (later he would say at 
thirty, thirty-two, etc.); “but back then I was lacking in these powers, as 
compared to now. Yet I feel that I'm still growing, whereas without you 
growth would have stopped long ago. In fact, I hadn’t been growing for 
the last two or three years before we started living together. You've 
given me back the vitality of my early youth, the strength to move 
beyond where I would've stopped, where I'd already stopped without 
you. 

“What about the energy of work, Verochka? Doesn't that mean quite 
a lot? Labor takes on passionate exhilaration when one’s whole life is 
organized that way. You know how a cup of coffee or a glass of wine 
affects the mental energy of work; the kind of stimulation they provide 
to other people for an hour, followed by a letdown proportionate to 
that external, temporary excitement, I now feel all the time. My nerves 
are constantly so attuned; they’re strong and vital.” (Gross materialism 


yet again, we observe .. . and so on.) 
And these conversations occurred even more frequently and lasted 
longer. 


“A person who hasn't yet experienced how love stimulates all of a 
person's powers hasn't known true love.” 


What Is to Be Done? 357 


“Love consists of promoting someone else’s development and of 
developing oneself.” 

“Anyone who has no active powers will be endowed with them by 
love. Anyone who has them already will be given the means to use 
them.” 

“Only a man who helps his beloved wife rise to independence truly 
loves her.” 

“Only a person whose mind grows brighter and whose hands grow 
stronger knows true love.” 


Conversations such as the following are very frequent. 

“My dear, I’m now reading Boccaccio.”237 (“What immorality!” we 
observe with the perspicacious reader. A woman reading Boccaccio! 
Why, only the two of us can do that. Besides, I also note the following: 
in five minutes a woman could hear more genuine nastiness, albeit of 
avery proper kind, from the mouth of a perspicacious reader than she 
could find in all of Boccaccio. Furthermore, of course, she wouldn't 
hear from the reader one single bright, fresh, pure thought, of which 
Boccaccio has so very many.) “You were right, my dear, when you said 
how enormously talented he was. Some of his stories, in my opinion, 
deserve to be placed alongside the best dramas by Shakespeare in 
terms of their profundity and subtle psychological analysis.” 

“How do you find the comical stories, where he stands so little on 
ceremony?” 

“A few of them are amusing, but in general I find them boring, like 
any farce that’s too crude.” 

“One must forgive him that. He lived five hundred years before us. 
Things that seem too lewd or cheap to us now weren't considered 
indecent then.” 

“In the same way many of our customs and manners will seem 
crude and dirty in much less than five hundred years. But that’s be- 
side the point. I’m talking about those wonderful stories where Boc- 
caccio seriously depicts passionate, sublime love. Those stories show 
his great talent best. Here’s what I meant to say, Sasha. He depicts love 
very well and vividly, but judging from his work, one can see that in 
those days people didn’t understand the tenderness of love as we do 
now. Love was not felt so strongly then, even though it’s been said that 
his age was one when love was enjoyed most fully. No, no matter what, 


237. The Italian poet, storyteller, and humanist Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) is best 
known for his classic, the Decameron (1348-1353), a collection of witty and often licen- 
tious tales that marked the transition from medieval to modern literary themes and 
strongly influenced the style of later Italian prose. 


358 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


people didn’t enjoy love then even half as much as we do now. Their 
feelings were too superficial, their rapture too weak and momentary. 

“The intensity of sensation is in proportion to the level of feeling 
from which it evolves in the organism. If it’s motivated exclusively by 
an external object or stimulus, it’s short-lived and encompasses only 
one particular side of life. A person who drinks merely because he’s 
offered a glass knows very little about the taste of wine; it affords him 
too little enjoyment. Pleasure is much stronger when it’s rooted in the 
imagination and when the imagination seeks an object and motive for 
enjoyment. It’s then that the blood runs faster, feels warmer, and 
conveys the sensation of much greater rapture. But this is still very 
weak compared to when those relations connected with rapture are 
rooted in the very depths of moral life. In that case the stimulation 
pervades the entire nervous system and excites it both forcefully and 
lastingly. Warmth infuses the whole being: it’s not merely the beating 
of one’s heart aroused by fantasy. No, the entire being feels extraordi- 
nary freshness and lightness. It’s as if there were a change in the 
atmosphere a person’s breathing, as if the air becomes much purer 
and richer in oxygen. It’s like sensations experienced on a warm, 
sunny day or what it feels like to be warmed by the sun. The tremen- 
dous difference is that freshness and lightness are developing in the 
nerves themselves and are perceived directly by them, without inter- 
mediary elements weakening that caressing strength.” 


“I'm very glad I gave up that harmful fashion before it was too late. 
It’s true: nothing should hinder the circulation of the blood. But why 
rejoice afterward if one’s skin appears softer? That's as it should be. 
And from what trifles! Perhaps, but such trifles spoil the legs. Socks 
should stay up by themselves without causing any constraint. The 
flow of the line then becomes harmonious and this gash disappears.” 

“It doesn’t go away that fast. Even though I'd worn a corset only 
three years, I’d stopped before our life together. But the truth is that 
nowadays dresses pinch the waist anyway, even without a corset. But 
is it really true that this fashion too will pass, just as the leg has 
healed? Surely it’s going out of fashion even now and will soon pass 
entirely. How pleased I'll be! What an unbearable style for a dress! It’s 
high time we understood that Greek women were smarter; we should 
wear dresses that are loose fitting right from the shoulder, just as they 
did. The style of our dresses ruins our figures. But my own lines are 
recovering and I’m very pleased about it!” 


“How lovely you are, Verochka!” 
“How happy I am, Sasha.”

His sweet speeches are 
Like the babble of a brook; 
His smile 

And his kiss.238 


Dear friend! Quench 

Your kisses. 

Even without them 

My blood races when I’m near you. 
Even without them 

My face flushes, 

My breast heaves, 

And my eyes sparkle 

Like stars at night.299 


xvi. Vera Pavlovna’s Fourth Dream 


Vera Pavlovna has a dream. 
From the distance she hears the sound of a familiar voice. Oh, how 
familiar it is now, and it’s drawing nearer and nearer.24° 


Wie herrlich leuchtet 
Mir die Natur! 

Wie glanzt die Sonne! 
Wie lacht die Flur!2*} 


(How splendid the brightness 
Of nature around me! 

How the sun shines! 

How the fields laugh!) 


Vera Pavlovna sees that it is so; everything is just like that. 


238. From the dramatic poem Faust (1808, 1833), by the preeminent German poet, 
dramatist, and novelist, as well as Weimar minister of state, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 
(1749-1832). An extremely complex work influenced by the excesses of the French Revo- 
lution and Napoleonic conquests in Germany, Faust proclaims the limitations of human 
knowledge and abilities, but nonetheless exalts the quest for truth. The passage, from 
“Gretchen’s Room” (Part 1), should read: “And the magic stream / Of his words—what 
bliss! / The clasp of his hand / And, ah, his kiss!” 

239. From the poem “Russian Song” (1841; first published 1843), by the lyric poet 
Aleksei Koltsov (1809-1842), whose themes generally concerned nature, peasant life, and 
the countryside and whose popular verses were subsequently set to music. Cherny- 
shevsky is quoting from a version of the poem that was altered slightly by the radical 
critic Vissarion Belinsky (1811-1848) and published in 1846. 

240. The voice is that of Bosio (see above, pp. 236-43 and n. 138). 

241. The opening lines of Goethe's poem “Mailied” (“May Song”; 1771). 


360 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


The field glimmers with a golden tint; the meadow is covered with 
flowers; and hundreds upon thousands of blossoms unfold on bushes 
surrounding the meadow. The forest that rises up behind grows 
greener, whispers, and is decked out in bright flowers. A fragrance 
wafts in from the field, the meadow, the shrubs, and from the flowers 
that fill the forest. Birds flutter in the branches of the trees; their 
thousands of voices float down from above together with all the fra- 
grances. Beyond the field, meadow, shrubs, and forest there appear 
other fields glimmering with gold, meadows swathed in flowers, 
shrubs decked with blossoms—stretching all the way to the distant 
mountains, covered with forests and lit by the sun. Here and there 
bright silvery, golden, purple, or translucent clouds lightly tint the 
brilliant azure of the sky along the horizon. The sun has just risen; 
nature rejoices and brings joy. It pours light and warmth, fragrance 
and song, love and bliss into the heart; and a song of joy and bliss, love 
and goodness pours forth from the heart. “Oh, earth! Oh, bliss! Oh, 
love! Oh, splendid golden love, like morning clouds over mountain- 
tops!” 


O Erd’! O Sonne! 
O Gluck! O Lust! 


O Lieb, o Liebe! 

So golden sch6én, 
Wie Morgenwolken 
Auf jenen Hohn!242 


(Oh, earth! Oh, sun! 
Oh, happiness! Oh, delight! 


Oh, love, oh, love! 
So golden-beautiful, 
Like morning clouds 
Over those hills!) 


“Now do you recognize me? Do you see that I am beautiful? You still 
don’t. None of you yet knows me in all my beauty. Behold now what 
was, what is, and what shall be. Look and listen:” 


Wohl perlet im Glase der purpurne Wein, 
Wohl glanzen die Augen der GaAste, . . . 244 


242. LI. 11-16 of Goethe's “Maileid.” 
243. The opening lines of the poem “Die vier Weltalter” (“The Four Ages of the World”; 


What Is to Be Done? 361 


(The goblet sparkles with purple wine, 
The eyes of the guests shine brightly, .. . ) 


At the foot of the mountains, on the outskirts of the forest, amidst 
the bushes flowering in tall, thick avenues, a palace looms up. 

“Let's go there.” 

They walk; they fly. 

A magnificent feast is in progress. Wine bubbles in glasses. 

The guests’ eyes sparkle. It’s noisy, but whispers and laughter can 
be heard beneath the noise. Hands are squeezed in secret; at times an 
inaudible kiss is stealthily exchanged. “A song! A song! Our celebration 
isn’t complete without a song!” The poet rises: both his face and his 
mind are illumined with inspiration. Nature confides her secrets to 
him, history reveals its meaning, and in his song thousands of years of 
life parade by in a series of tableaux. 


1. 


The words of the poet ring out and the first scene appears. 

Tents of nomads. Sheep, horses, and camels graze around the tents. 
In the distance stand groves of olives and fig trees. Farther still, on the 
horizon to the northwest, stands a double chain of lofty mountains. 
The summits are covered with snow, their slopes with cedars. But the 
shepherds are more slender than the cedars, their wives more graceful 
than the palms. Their indolent life is untroubled in its sweet state of 
bliss. They have but one concern—love. They spend all their time, day 
after day, in caresses and songs of love. 

“No,” says the radiant beauty. “This isn’t about me. I didn’t exist 
then. This woman is still a slave. Where there’s no equality, I don’t 
exist. This goddess was named Astarte.2** Look, here she is.” 

A splendid woman. She wears heavy gold bracelets on her wrists 
and ankles and a heavy necklace of pearls and coral set in gold around 
her neck. Her hair is annointed with myrrh. There is sensuality and 
servility in her face, sensuality and vacuity in her eyes. 

“Submit to your master. Sweeten his idleness in the intervals be- 
tween his forays. You must love him because he has bought you: if you 
don't, then he'll kill you,” she says to the woman lying before her in the 
dust. 

“You can see that this isn’t me,” says the beauty. 


1802), by the German poet, dramatist, and historian Johann Christoph Friedrich von 
Schiller (1759-1805). 

244. A Semitic goddess of fertility and love corresponding to the Greek Aphrodite, 
Astarte was the most important female deity of the Phoenicians. 


362 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


2. 


The inspired words of the poet ring out again. 

A new scene appears. 

A city. Mountains stretch into the distance to the north and east; far 
off to the south and east, but closer to the west, lies the sea. A wonder- 
ful city! Its houses are neither large nor luxurious from the outside. 
But there are many magnificent temples, especially on the hill with 
stairs leading up to gates of astonishing size and beauty. The entire hill 
is covered with temples and public buildings, each one of which 
would be sufficient to add to the beauty and glory of the most magnifi- 
cent of today’s capitals. There are thousands of statues in these tem- 
ples and throughout the whole town—any one of them would be 
enough to transform the museum in which it stood into the foremost 
collection in the whole world. How beautiful are the people who 
crowd the squares and streets! Each one of these young men, women, 
and girls could serve as a model for a statue. They are active, lively, 
cheerful people whose whole life is radiant and elegant. These houses 
don't appear to be luxurious from the outside, but what a wealth of 
elegance and what a high capacity for enjoyment they reveal inside. 
One could easily lose oneself in admiration before each item of furni- 
ture and each piece of crockery. And these people are all so beautiful, 
so able to appreciate beauty, to live for love, to serve beauty. 

Here’s an exile returning to the city that had ousted him from pow- 
er; now he’s coming back to rule—everyone knows that. Why are no 
hands raised up against him? Because riding next to him on his char- 
iot stands a woman of exceptional beauty (even among all these beau- 
tiful creatures). She presents him to the people, asking them to accept 
him, telling them that she is his patroness. Bowing down before her 
beauty, the people confer upon her beloved Pisistratus the right to rule 
over them.245 

Here's a courtroom. The judges are gloomy old men. The people 
may be won over, but not these judges. The Areopagus?*6 is known for 
its merciless severity, its implacable impartiality. Gods and goddesses 
have come here to submit their affairs to judgment. And now this 
woman, considered by all to be guilty of horrendous crimes, is sup- 
posed to appear before them. She must die, this destroyer of Athens; 
each of the judges has already decided the matter in his heart. But 


245. Pisistratus (605?-527 B.c.) seized power in Athens around 560 B.c. Though he was

when the accused Aspasia?4”7 appears before them, they fall to the 
ground before her, saying, “You can’t be condemned, for you are too 
beautiful!” Is this not the kingdom of beauty? Is this not the kingdom 
of love? 

“No,” says the radiant beauty, “I didn’t exist then either. They bowed 
down before woman, but they didn’t consider her an equal. They 
worshiped her, but only as a source of pleasure. They didn't yet ac- 
knowledge her human dignity. Where there’s no respect for woman as 
a human being, I still don’t exist. This goddess was named Aphro- 
dite.2*8 Look, here she is.” 

This goddess wears no adornments at all. She’s so beautiful that her 
worshipers didn’t want her to wear any clothes: her marvelous shape 
was not to be hidden from their enraptured gaze. 

What does she say to the woman almost as beautiful as she, who's 
scattering incense on her altar? 

“Be a source of pleasure for man. He’s your master. Live for him, not 
for yourself.” 

Her eyes reflect only the languor of physical pleasure. Her stance is 
proud, as is her expression, but she takes pride only in her physical 
beauty. What sort of life was a woman condemned to lead during her 
reign? Man locked her up in the gynecium?*9 so that no one but he, 
her master, could enjoy the beauty that belonged to him. She had no 
freedom. There were other women who called themselves free, but 
they sold both the enjoyment of their beauty and their freedom. “No, 
they had no freedom either. This goddess was half-slave. Where there 
is no freedom, there is no happiness and I don't exist.”

The words of the poet ring out again. A new scene appears. 

An arena before a castle. Around it arises an amphitheater filled with 
a crowd of dazzling spectators. Knights are already waiting in the 
arena. Above it, on the castle balcony, sits a young woman. She holds a 
scarf in her hand. The victorious knight will receive that scarf and the 
right to kiss her hand. The knights fight to the death. Toggenburg?5° 
wins.

“Oh, knight, I love you as a sister would. Demand no other love from 
me. My heart pounds neither at your approach nor at your departure.” 

“My fate is sealed,” he replies, and sets sail for Palestine. His fame 
spreads throughout Christendom. But he can’t go on living without 
seeing the goddess of his heart. He returns without having found 
oblivion in battle. 

“Oh, knight, don’t come searching here. She’s gone off to a convent.” 

He builds himself a hut; from it, unbeknownst to her, he can watch 
her open the window of her cell every morning. His whole life consists 
of waiting for her to appear at that window, beautiful as the sun. He 
has no other life except to catch a glimpse of his heart’s goddess; he 
has no other life until the day he dies. Even as his life is fading, still 
he sits by the window of his little hut, thinking only, “Will I ever see her 
again?” 

“This isn’t about me at all,” says the radiant beauty. “He loved her as 
long as he didn’t touch her. If she’d become his wife, then she’d have 
become his subject. She’d have had to tremble before him. He’d have 
locked her up and stopped loving her. He’d have taken long hunting 
trips, gone off to fight wars, caroused with his comrades, and raped his 
vassals’ wives, while his wife would have been abandoned, locked 
away, despised. At that time, once a man touched a woman, he 
stopped loving her. No, I didn’t exist then. This goddess is named 
Chastity.251 Look, here she is.” 

She’s a modest, gentle, tender, beautiful woman—more beautiful 
than Astarte, even more beautiful than Aphrodite, but she’s pensive, 
gloomy, and sorrowful. Others bow their knees before her and bring 
her garlands of roses. She says: “My soul is sad unto deathly sorrow. A 
sword has pierced my heart. You must grieve as well. You are unhap- 
py. The earth is a vale of tears.” 

“No, no, I didn’t exist then,” says the radiant beauty.

“No, these goddesses aren’t at all like me. They continue to reign, 
but their kingdoms are in decline. The birth of each new kingdom 
initiates the decline of the previous one. I was born only when the last 
one began to crumble. Since my birth their kingdoms have declined 
more rapidly; soon they will completely disappear. Each new kingdom 
failed to replace its predecessor altogether, so that they all continue to 
coexist. But I shall replace them all; soon they'll all disappear and I 
alone will remain to rule over the whole world. But they had to reign 
before me; my kingdom couldn't have come into being without theirs. 


251. An allusion to the Virgin Mary.

“People used to be like animals. They ceased being so when man 
began to value woman's beauty. But woman wasn't as strong as man, 
and man was a coarse creature. At that time everything was decided 
by force. Having begun to value woman's beauty, man took her as his 
own. She became his property, his chattel. This was the reign of 
Astarte. 

“When man developed further, he came to value woman's beauty 
more than ever and began to worship her. But woman’s consciousness 
wasn't yet fully developed. He valued her only for her beauty. She was 
able to think only those thoughts that she heard from him. He said 
that he was a human being but that she wasn't; she still viewed herself 
as a splended treasure belonging to him. She didn’t consider herself 
human. This was the reign of Aphrodite. 

“But soon the consciousness that she too was a human being began 
to awaken in her. What grief must have seized her at the dawning of 
even the weakest notion of her own human dignity! For she wasn’t yet 
acknowledged to be a person. Man still didn’t want to have her as a 
companion for himself, other than as his slave. She said, ‘I don’t wish 
to be your companion! Then his passion made him entreat her and 
submit. He forgot that he didn’t consider her a human being, and 
came to love her as an unattainable, untouchable, and inviolable maid- 
en. But as soon as she believed his entreaty, as soon as he touched her, 
then woe unto her! She was in his hands, and those hands were 
stronger than hers. He was coarse; he made her his slave and despised 
her. Woe unto her! This is the sorrowful reign of the Virgin. 

“But centuries passed. My sister (Do you know her? ... She ap- 
peared to you before I did.) did her work. She preceded the others and 
has always existed. She existed before people were created and has 
always labored tirelessly. Her work was difficult, her successes gradu- 
al, but she toiled on and on and soon became more successful. Man 
became wiser; more and more, woman strongly perceived herself as a 
human being equal to him. And the time came, and I was born. 

“That was not so long ago, not long ago at all. Do you know who first 
sensed that I had been born and who announced it to the others? It 
was Rousseau in La Nouvelle Héloise 252 People heard about me for the 
first time in that book. 

“Since then my kingdom has expanded. I still don’t rule over very 
many people. But now my kingdom is growing rapidly and you can 


252. A novel by the French-Swiss philosopher, political theorist, and skeptic Jean- 
Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), Julie: ou La Nouvelle Héloise (1761) contains a sharp 
critique of European society in general and the position of women in particular (see also 
Introduction, 23). Rousseau is perhaps best known for his theory, expressed most fully in 
Treatisé du contrat social (1762), that human beings are naturally good and equal, but 
become corrupted by civilization. They therefore must enter into contracts establishing 
governments to correct the resulting inequalities.

already foresee a time when I shall rule over all the earth. Only then 
will people fully appreciate my beauty. Those who acknowledge my 
power at this time are still incapable of obeying my will entirely. They 
are surrounded by crowds of people who are hostile to it. These peo- 
ple would torment them, poison their lives, if they knew my will and 
fulfilled it entirely. But I desire happiness; I require no suffering what- 
ever. So I tell them: ‘Don’t do anything you will be persecuted for. 
Know my will only so far as you can without causing harm to your- 
selves.’” 

“But can I ever know you fully?” asks Vera Pavlovna. 

“Yes, you can. You're in a fortunate position. You have nothing to 
fear. You can do anything you want. If you knew my will entirely, you'd 
know I'd do nothing to harm you. You must not and will not desire 
anything for which you'd be tormented by those who don’t know me. 
You're now completely satisfied by what you have; you don’t think 
about anything or anyone else, nor will you. I can reveal myself to you 
entirely.” 

“Tell me your name, then. You named the other goddesses, but you 
still haven’t told me your name.” 

“So you want me to tell you my name? Look at me and listen to me.”

“Look and listen. Do you recognize my voice? Do you recognize my 
face? Haven't you seen it before?” 

No, she hadn't seen her face, hadn't seen her at all. Why then did it 
seem as if she had? She'd seen her often during the last year, ever 
since she'd first spoken with him, when he first looked at her and 
kissed her, she'd been seeing this radiant beauty who didn't hide from 
her and who'd appeared to her as she did to him. 

“No, I haven’t seen you before, I haven't seen your face. You ap- 
peared to me, and I caught a glimpse of you, but you were surrounded 
by such radiance that I really couldn't see you. I only noticed that you 
were more beautiful than all the others. I heard your voice too, but 
only to recognize that it was lovelier than all the others.” 

“Behold, for your sake I shall dim the brightness of my aura for a 
moment; for a moment my voice will be heard without the enchanting 
quality I usually give it. For a moment I shall cease being a goddess 
just for you. There. Did you see? Did you hear? Do you recognize me? 
Enough! I'm a goddess again and shall remain so forever!” 

Once more she’s surrounded by the full brilliance of her radiance 
and her voice is inexpressibly enchanting. But for that one moment 
when she ceased to be a goddess and allowed herself to be recog-

nized—could it be? Did Vera Pavlovna really see that face? Did she 
really hear that voice? 

“Yes,” replies the goddess. “You wanted to know who I am and you 
found out. You wanted to learn my name. I have no name other than 
that of the person to whom I appear. My name is her name. Now you 
have seen who I am. There's nothing nobler than a human being, 
nothing nobler than a woman. I am the woman to whom I appear, the 
one who loves and is loved.” 

Yes, Vera Pavlovna did see: it was she herself, but as a goddess 253 
The goddess’s countenance was her own, her own living countenance, 
whose features were so far from perfection. Every day she encoun- 
tered many faces that were much more beautiful than hers. Yet this 
was her very own face, glowing with the radiance of love, lovelier than 
all the ideals bequeathed to us by the great sculptors of antiquity and 
the great artists of the golden age of painting. Yes, it was she herself, 
but glowing with the radiance of love. In Petersburg, a city so lacking in 
beauty, there were hundreds of faces more beautiful than hers. But 
she was far more beautiful than the Aphrodite in the Louvre,254 lovelier 
than all the famous beauties known before. 

“Youre seeing your reflection in a mirror just as you are, without 
me. In me you behold yourself as you are seen by the one who loves 
you. For his sake I merge with you. For him there’s no one more 
beautiful than you. For him all ideals pale beside you.” 

Isn't that so? 

It is so, it is so!

“Now you know who I am; next you shall learn what I am. 

“I possess all the sensual pleasure that was contained in Astarte. 
She's the ancestor of all of us, the other goddesses who replaced her. I 
possess all the ecstasy at the contemplation of beauty which was 
contained in Aphrodite. I possess all the reverence before purity 
which was contained in Chastity. 

“But in me all these qualities are fuller, nobler, and stronger than in 
those others. What was in Chastity is combined in me with the quali- 
ties of Astarte and Aphrodite. In combination with other strengths, 
each of these qualities becomes even more powerful, greater as a

result of the synthesis.255 But much more power and splendor are 
bestowed on each of these qualities in me by that new element which 
wasn't present in any of the earlier goddesses. That new element 
which distinguishes me from all others is ‘equal rights between lovers,’ 
that is, an equal relationship between them as human beings. As a 
result of this new element alone, everything I possess is much, oh so 
much more beautiful than it was in them. 

“When a man acknowledges a woman’s rights as equal to his own, 
he’s renouncing the view of her as his personal property. Then she 
loves him as he loves her, only because she wants to. If she doesn’t so 
wish, then he has no rights over her whatsoever, as she has none over 
him. Therefore I am freedom. 

“As a result of this equality and freedom, everything in me that was 
present in earlier goddesses has acquired a new character, a greater 
splendor, one that was unknown before me and that makes everything 
else insignificant. 

“Previously sensual pleasure wasn’t known fully because without 
the free attraction of two lovers, neither could experience radiant rap- 
ture. Before me ecstasy at the contemplation of beauty was not fully 
known, because if beauty isn’t revealed through free attraction, there is 
no radiant rapture in its contemplation. Without free attraction both 
pleasure and delight are dull in comparison with what they are in me. 
My chastity is purer than that of Chastity, who spoke only about purity 
of the body. I possess purity of heart. I’m free because in me there's 
neither deceit nor pretense. | say no word that | don't feel. I bestow no 
kiss barren of love.256 

“But in and of itself the new quality in me that conveys loveliness 
greater than all earlier goddesses’ constitutes my loveliness, greater 
than anything else. A master is embarrassed before his servant, a ser- 
vant before his master; man is completely free only among equals. It’s 
tiresome to be with one’s inferiors; only among equals can one experi- 
ence true joy. That's why before me, just as man did not know the full 
happiness of love, what he experienced was unworthy of being called 
happiness—it was merely momentary intoxication. As for woman— 
before me she was so pitiful. She was a subordinate, an enslaved 
creature, living in fear; before me she knew too little about the nature 
of love. Where there's fear, there’s no love... . 


255. In claiming that this merger makes the whole more powerful than the sum of its 
parts while also enhancing the quality of each part, Chernyshevsky reflects a central 
tenet of German idealist philosophy and anticipates the contemporary scientific con- 
cept of synergy. The idea also corresponds to Chernyshevsky’s belief that cooperative 
labor improves the welfare of both the individual and society. 

256. This passage recalls Julie's advice to Vera Pavlovna in chap. 1 (see p. 70 above). 


What Is to Be Done? 369 


“Therefore, if you wish to express in one phrase what I am, it’s ‘equal 
rights.’ Without them the pleasures of the body and delight in beauty 
are tedious, dull, and vile. Without them there’s no purity of heart, 
only the deceptive purity of the body. As a result of this equality in me 
there is also freedom, without which I cannot exist. 

“I've told you everything so that now you can tell others what I am. 
But at present my kingdom is still small; I must protect my people 
from the slander of those who don’t yet know me. At this time I can’t 
reveal my will fully to everyone. I shall do so only when my kingdom 
encompasses all people. When everyone becomes beautiful in body 
and pure in heart, then I will reveal all of my beauty to them. As for 
you, your fate is particularly fortunate. I'll neither confuse you nor 
harm you in describing to you what I'll be like when everyone be- 
comes worthy of acknowledging me as their goddess, as opposed to 
now, when there are still so few. To you alone I will reveal the secrets 
of my future. Promise to keep silent and listen.”

“Oh, my love, now I know your will completely. I know that it will 
come to pass, but what will it be like? How will people live then?” 

“I can’t tell you that by myself. I need the help of my older sister, the 
one who first appeared to you a long time ago. She's both my mistress 
and my servant. I can only be what she makes of me, and yet she works 
for me. Sister, come to my aid.” 

The Sister of Her Sisters, the Bride of Her Bridegrooms appears. 

“Greetings, sister,” she says to the goddess. “Are you here too, sis- 
ter?” she asks Vera Pavlovna. “Do you want to see how people will live 
when my ward, the goddess, rules over everyone? Then behold.” 

There stands a building, a large, enormous structure such as can be 
seen only in a few of the grandest capitals. No, now there's no other 
building like it! It stands amidst fields and meadows, orchards and 
groves. The fields grow grain, but they aren't like the ones we have 
now; rather, they're rich and abundant. Is that really wheat? Whoever 
saw ears and kernels like these? Now such ears and kernels can be 


257. This section probably signifies the revolution, which Chernyshevsky obviously 
could not describe because of tsarist censorship. 


370 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


grown only in greenhouses. The fields are our fields, but now such 
blossoms can be seen only in flower gardens. The orchards are full of 
lemons and orange trees, peach and apricot—how can they grow in 
the fresh air? Oh, there are columns surrounding them, all open for 
summer. Yes, these are greenhouses opened up for summer. The 
groves are our groves—oak and linden, maple and elm—yes, the 
groves are just like ours now. Great care has been lavished on them; 
there’s not a single diseased tree. But the groves are just like ours, they 
alone have remained the same as they were before. But this building— 
what on earth is it? What style of architecture? There’s nothing at all 
like it now. No, there is one building that hints at it—the palace at 
Sydenham:25* cast iron and crystal, crystal and cast iron—nothing 
else. No, that's not all; it's merely the shell of the building, its external 
facade. Inside there’s a real house, a colossal one, surrounded by this 
crystal and cast iron edifice as if by a sheath, forming broad galleries 
around it on every floor. What graceful architecture in the inner house! 
What narrow spaces between the windows! The windows themselves 
are huge, wide, and stretch the entire height of each floor. The stone 
walls look like a row of pilasters that form a frame for these windows 
looking out onto the galleries. What sort of floors and ceilings are 
these? Of what material are these doors and windowframes made? 
What is it? Silver? Platinum? Almost all the furniture is made the same 
way! Wooden furniture here is merely a whim, something for variety’s 
sake. But of what are all the other pieces, the ceilings, and the floors 
made? “Try to move this armchair,” says the elder goddess. The metal- 
lic furniture is lighter than walnut. What kind of metal is it? Oh, now I 
know. Sasha once showed me a small piece of it that was as light as 
glass. They make earrings and brooches from it now. Yes, Sasha said 
that sooner or later aluminum would replace wood, and perhaps even 
stone.259 How elegant it all is! Aluminum and more aluminum; all the 
spaces between the windows are hung with huge mirrors. What car- 
pets on the floors! Here in this hall half the floor has been left un- 
covered and one can see that it too is made of aluminum. “You see, it’s 
been left unpolished so that it won't be too slippery. Children play 
here, and adults do, too. In that hall the floor has been left completely 
uncovered for dancing. There are tropical flowers and trees every- 
where. The entire house is a huge winter garden.”

But who lives in this house that is more magnificent than any pal- 
ace? “Many people live here, a great many. Come along and we shall 
see them.” 

They go out onto the balcony that leads off the top floor of the 
gallery. Why hadn't Vera Pavlovna noticed them before? Groups of 
people are scattered throughout the fields. There are men and women 
everywhere, old people and young, together with children. But pri- 
marily there are young people. There are very few old men and even 
fewer old women; there are more children than old men, but not many 
of them either. More than half the children have remained inside to 
attend to the housework. They do almost all the chores and enjoy 
their work very much. A few old women work with them. But there are 
really very few old men and women here because people grow old very 
late. Life is so healthy and peaceful that it preserves one’s freshness. 

The groups working in the fields are almost all singing. What kind of 
labor are they doing? Oh, they're gathering in the grain. How quickly it 
progresses! Why shouldn't it? Why shouldn't they be singing? Ma- 
chines are doing almost all the work for them—reaping, binding the 
sheaves, and carting them away. People have only to walk alongside, or 
ride, or drive the machines. How cleverly they've arranged it all for 
themselves. Although the weather's very hot, it doesn’t bother them at 
all. They've erected a huge canopy over the part of the field where 
they're working. As the work progresses, the canopy gets moved along 
too. Hew cool they stay! Why shouldn’t their labor go quickly and 
cheerfully? Why shouldn't they be singing? I too wouldn't mind har- 
vesting under such conditions! And there are songs and more songs, 
all of them new and unfamiliar. Now they're singing one of ours which 
I know too: 


You and I will live like kings: 
These people are our friends— 
Whatever your heart desires, 
I will acquire it all with them.26° 


Now the work is finished and everyone returns to the building. 
“Let's go back to the hall and see how they dine,” says the elder sister. 
They enter the largest of the huge halls. Half of it is occupied by tables 
that have already been set. There are so many of them! How many 
people dine here? A thousand or more. Not everyone's here; those 
who prefer to eat in their own rooms dine there. The old men and 
women and the children who didn't work in the fields have prepared 


260. From Koltsov's poem “Flight” (1838) (see n. 239 above). 


372 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


everything. “To prepare food, do the housework, clean the rooms— 
this work is too easy for other hands,” says the eider sister. “It’s appro- 
priate that such tasks be done by those who aren't yet able or no 
longer able to do anything else.” What splendid place settings! All 
aluminum and crystal. Vases with flowers have been placed at the 
middle of the wide tables. The food has already been served. The 
workers have entered and sat down to dinner, as have those who 
prepared the meal. 

“Who'll serve the food?” 

“When? During the meal? Why? There are only five or six courses. 
Dishes that are supposed to be hot have been placed so they won't get 
cold. Do you see these indentations? They're steam tables,” explains 
the elder sister. 

“You live well and like to eat well. Do you dine like this often?” 

“Several times a year.” 

“Here this is regular fare: anyone who wants to can have better food, 
whatever he wants, and a separate account is kept. No such account is 
kept for those who don't ask for anything except the dishes prepared 
for all. Everything else is arranged in the same way. What everyone can 
afford together is provided free; but a charge is made for any special 
item or whim.” 

“Is that really us? Is that really our country? I heard one of our own 
songs and they are all speaking Russian.” 

“Yes, you see that river not far from here? It’s the Oka2®! These 
people are Russians—for when I’m with you, I too am a Russian.” 

“Did you accomplish all this?” 

“All this was accomplished for my sake; I inspired it and inspire its 
completion. But it’s she, my elder sister, the worker, who's bringing it 
into being. I merely delight in it.” 

“And will everyone live like this?” 

“Everyone,” says the elder sister. “For everyone there will be eternal 
spring and summer and joy everlasting. But we've shown you only the 
end of my half of the day, the work part, and the beginning of her half. 
We'll look in on them again during an evening two months from now.” 


9. 


The flowers have withered and the leaves have begun to fall from the 
trees; the scene has become more desolate. 
“You see, it would be tedious to keep looking at all this and very 


261. A northern tributary of the Volga River, the Oka lies somewhat south and east of 
Moscow, to which it is connected by the Moscow River.

boring to live here,” says the younger sister. “I don't want to live like 
this.” 

“The halls are empty; there’s no one left in the fields or gardens,” 
says the elder sister. “I arranged all this according to the will of my 
sister the goddess.” 

“Has the palace really been deserted?” 

“Yes, for now it’s cold and damp. Why should anyone live here? Out 
of some two thousand people, only ten or twenty eccentrics remain 
who feel that for once it would provide a pleasant diversion to stay in 
this remote and solitary area and experience a northern autumn. 
Soon, during the winter, there'll be constant changes: small groups of 
people who like winter outings will arrive to spend a few days here.” 

“But where are they all now?” 

“Wherever it’s warm and pleasant,” says the elder sister. “In the 
summer, when it’s nice to be here and there’s work to be done, many 
different guests arrive from the south. We were in a building where all 
the inhabitants came from your country. But a great many houses had 
to be built to accommodate all the guests; in some, people from differ- 
ent lands have settled together with their hosts. Each person chooses 
the company that suits him best. But, having received this multitude of 
guests for the summer to help with the work, you can head south to 
spend the other seven or eight unpleasant months of the year; each 
person goes wherever he chooses. There's a special region in the 
south where the majority of your people go. It's even called "New 
Russia.“ 

“Is that where Odessa and Kherson are?”262 

“That was in your time. Behold: here’s New Russia.” 

Mountains are clad in gardens; between them stand narrow valleys 
and broad ravines. “These mountains used to be barren cliffs,” says the 
elder sister. “Now they're covered with a thick layer of soil; groves of 
very tall trees grow among gardens. Below, in moist hollows, are coffee 
plantations. Date palms and fig trees stand above; vineyards are inter- 
spersed among sugar-cane plantations; in the green fields grows some 
wheat, but mainly rice.” 

“What country is this?” 

“Let's climb a little higher and you'll see its borders.” 

Far off to the northeast are two rivers that flow together and head 
due east from where Vera Pavlovna stands. Farther to the south, still in

fertile area acquired by Russia during the late eighteenth century, this region generally

the same southeasterly direction, lies a long, wide bay. The land ex- 
tends far to the south, continually growing wider between that bay 
and another longer, narrow one that forms its western boundary. Be- 
tween the small western bay and the sea far to the northwest lies a 
narrow isthmus. 

“We're in the middle of a desert,” says Vera Pavlovna in astonish- 
ment. 

“Well, in the middle of a former desert. But now, as you can see, this 
whole expanse of land from the north, from that large river in the 
northeast, has been transformed into the most fertile fields, just as that 
other strip along the sea to the north once used to be and now is once 
again the strip that once upon a time was called ‘the land of milk and 
honey.’263 You can see that we're not far from the southern boundary 
of the cultivated land. The mountainous part of the peninsula is still a 
barren, sandy steppe, such as the whole area used to be in your day. 
With each passing year you Russians are pushing back the edge of the 
desert farther to the south. Other people are at work in other coun- 
tries; everyone has ample room and enough work. Life is spacious and 
abundant. Yes, from the great northeastern river the entire expanse of 
land to the middle of the peninsula in the south is now green and 
covered with flowers. Throughout the whole area, just as in the north, 
enormous buildings stand three or four versts apart, like innumerable 
huge chessmen on a gigantic chessboard. Let's go down and enter one 
of them,” says the elder sister. 

It's the same sort of enormous crystal building, but its columns are 
white. 

“They're made of aluminum,” explains the elder sister. “It's very hot 
here and white doesn't absorb heat in the direct sun. It’s a bit more 
expensive than cast iron, but it’s better suited to local conditions.“ 

Look what else they've invented! For a considerable distance all 
around the crystal palace there stand rows of tall, thin pillars; on top 
of them, high above the entire palace and for about half a verst around, 
stretches a white canopy. “It’s continually being sprinkled with water,” 
explains the elder sister. “From each pillar a small fountain rises above 
the canopy, spraying drops of water like rain. Consequently, it’s cool to 
live here. You see, they can adjust the temperature as they please.” 

“But what if someone likes the intense heat and bright southern 
sun?” 

“Do you see those pavilions and tents way out there in the distance? 


263. An allusion both to the land promised by God to Moses for the Hebrews (Exodus 
3:8) and to the biblical garden of Eden. The area described is the valley of the Tigris and 
Euphrates rivers, viewed by Vera Pavlovna from the Sinai Peninsula, where, on Mount 
Sinai, Moses received the Ten Commandments.

Everyone can live just as he pleases. I'm striving toward that end, 
working to bring it about.” 

“Then are there still cities left for those who want to live in them?” 

“Yes, but there aren't very many people like that left. There are fewer 
cities now and they are all located near the best harbors as centers of 
communication and transportation. But these cities are larger and 
more splendid than before. Everyone visits them for a few days in 
search of diversion. The majority of their inhabitants change con- 
stantly. People go there only to work for a brief period.” 

“But what about those who want to live there all the time?’ 

“They do, just as you now live in those Petersburgs, Parises, and 
Londons of yours. Whose business is it? Who would interfere? Let 
each person live as he chooses. The vast majority, however, ninety- 
nine people out of a hundred, live as my sister and I have shown you 
because it’s more pleasant and advantageous for them. But now let's 
go into the palace. It’s already quite late in the evening and time to see 
them.” 

“But no, first 1 want to know how it all came about.” 

“How what came about?” 

“How the barren desert was transformed into fertile land where 
almost everyone spends two-thirds of the year.” 

“How it came about? There's nothing strange about it! All of this 
happened not in one year, not even in ten; I accomplished it gradually. 
From the banks of the great river in the northeast and the shores of the 
great sea in the southwest, people transported clay on their mighty 
machines to bind the sand. They dug canals and irrigated the land; 
vegetation began to appear, and as a result, there was more moisture 
in the air. They moved forward, step by step, a few versts a year, 
sometimes only one, just as now they keep advancing toward the 
south. What’s so unusual about that? People merely became more 
intelligent and began to turn to their own advantage the tremendous 
means and resources that one had been wasted or used counterpro- 
ductively. I’ve not been working and teaching in vain. It was even 
difficult for them to understand what was most useful. During your 
time people were still savages, such coarse, cruel, and reckless crea- 
tures. But I kept teaching them. Once they began to understand, it was 
not hard for them to make progress. You know that I require nothing 
too difficult. Why, you yourself are doing something for me, in my own 
way! Is it really so hard?” 

“No.” 

“Of course not. Remember your own dressmaking establishment? 
Did you have many resources? Any more than others?” 

“No. We had no resources to speak of.” 


376 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“But now your seamstresses have ten times more comfort. They 
enjoy life twenty times as much and experience unpleasantness a 
hundred times less than others who had the same resources as you. 
You've proven that even in your own time people can lead a free and 
easy life. One has only to be rational, to know how to organize, and to 
learn how to use resources most advantageously.” 

“Yes, yes. I know that.” 

“Let's see how people live only a short time after they've come to 
understand what you've long understood.”

They enter the building. It’s the same sort of enormous, majestic 
hall. The evening is well under way. It’s already three hours after 
sunset, a time for merrymaking. How brightly the hall is lit, but how? 
There are neither candelabra nor chandeliers! Oh, that’s it! In the 
dome there hangs a large pane of frosted glass through which light 
pours into the room. Of course, that’s just how it ought to be: pale, soft, 
bright light, just like sunlight. Yes, indeed, it’s electric light.26+ There 
are about a thousand people in the hall, but it could easily accommo- 
date three times that number. 

“And it happens, when guests come to visit,” says the radiant beau- 
ty, ‘there can be more people here.” 

“Well, what sort of event is it? A ball? Surely it’s not just an ordinary 
weekday evening?” 

“Of course.” 

“Nowdays this would be a palace ball. The women are dressed so 
elegantly. Yes, indeed, times have changed, that’s clear from the cut of 
their dresses. A few ladies are wearing the clothes of our time, but 
obviously it’s being done for variety’s sake, as an amusement. Yes, 
they're being silly, mocking our apparel. Others are wearing different 
costumes—the most diverse kinds, various eastern and southern 
styles, all much more graceful than ours. But the most popular cos- 
tume is like what Grecian women wore during the elegant Athenian 
period. It’s very light and loose-fitting. The men wear long, wide tunics 
without waists, like cloaks or togas. Apparently it's their ordinarv do- 
mestic wear. How modest and lovely! It outlines their bodies so ele- 


264. Electric lighting became widespread in urban Russia only in the early twentieth 
century. Linking social revolution with technological innovation, Chernyshevsky seems 
to presage Lenin's famous declaration in 1920 that “communism equals Soviet power 
plus electrification of the whole country.” In contrast to Lenin, however, Chernyshevsky 
criticizes urban life; paradoxically his utopia is a predominantly rural society made 
prosperous and secure by industrial technology.

gantly and exquisitely; it enhances the grace of all their movements. 
And whatan orchestra! More than a hundred men and women! Best of 
all, what a chorus!” 

“Yes, today in all of Europe you couldn't find ten fine voices like the 
hundred now gathered in this hall. It’s the same in every other hall. 
The way of life here is so different: it’s healthy and very elegant. As a 
result, the chest improves and the voice does too,” explains the radiant 
beauty. But the members of both the orchestra and the chorus are 
constantly changing: some leave while others take their place. Some go 
off to dance, others return. 

“It's an ordinary weekday evening. People dance like this and make 
merry every evening. But when have I ever seen such energy in merri- 
ment? But how can their merriment help but possess an energy un- 
known to us? They spend the morning engaged in very hard work. 
Anyone who hasn't put in a good day’s work hasn’t prepared his 
nervous system well enough to experience the fullness of such enjoy- 
ment. The merriment of simple people, when they have occasion to 
make merry, is so much more joyous, lively, and spontaneous than 
ours. But now our simple people have very meager means for amuse- 
ment; here the means are so much greater than even ours are. Further- 
more, the merriment of our simple people is marred by the memory of 
various inconveniences and deprivations, misfortunes and sufferings, 
and by a foreboding of even more in the future. They have but a 
fleeting moment when grief and need are forgotten. Is it ever really 
possible to forget one’s grief and need entirely? Don’t the deserts cover 
everything with sand? Don’t the marshy miasmas2® contaminate even 
a small amount of good land and air lying between desert and swamp? 
But there are no such memories here, no danger of grief or need, only 
the recollection of free and willing labor, of abundance, goodness, and 
enjoyment. Here we have only the expectation of more of the same in 
the future. What a contrast! And again, the nervous system of our 
workers today is strong, but nothing more; although they can with- 
stand considerable merriment, they are coarse and insensitive. Where- 
as here their constitution is still strong, like that of our workers, as well 
as developed and impressionable, like our own. But they also possess 
a readiness to make merry, a healthy, strong desire for enjoyment 
which we lack; that’s granted only to those of sound health who do 
physical labor. In such people these qualities are combined with all 
the delicacy of feeling that we possess. They have all our moral devel- 
opment combined with the physical growth of our strong working

recalls Chernyshevsky's earlier discussion of soil qualities (see nn. 86 and 89 above). 


378 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


people. It's easy to understand why their merriment, enjoyment, and 
passion are so much stronger, broader, sweeter, and livelier than ours. 
What fortunate people! 

“No, people still don’t know what genuine merriment really is be- 
cause neither the kind of life nor the sort of people necessary for it 
exists yet. Only people such as these can enjoy themselves completely 
and know the full ecstasy of pleasure. How they burst with health and 
strength, how graceful and elegant they are, how energetic and ex- 
pressive their features! They're all so lucky, such handsome men and 
women, leading a free life of work and enjoyment. What fortunate 
people! What fortunate people! 

“Half of them are enjoying themselves exuberantly in the large hall. 
But where's the other half?” 

“Where are the others?” repeats the radiant beauty. “They're every- 
where. Many are at the theater, some as actors, others as musicians, 
and still others as spectators, just as they desire. Some are in lecture 
halls, museums, and libraries. Others are in garden avenues or in their 
own rooms, relaxing alone or with their children. As for the rest: that’s 
my secret.266 In the hall you saw how their cheeks glowed and their 
eyes sparkled. You saw how they came and went. When they leave, it’s 
I who lures them away. The room of each man and woman is my 
sanctuary. Within those walls my mysteries are inviolable. The cur- 
tained doors and thick carpets absorb every sound. Silence and mys- 
tery prevail. They return: it’s I who brings them back from my kingdom 
of mysteries into the realm of light entertainment. I reign here. 

“Here I reign. Everything is done for my sake! Work equals replenish- 
ment of feeling and strength for me; enjoyment equals preparation for 
me, relaxation after me. I constitute the purpose of life here; 1 am all of 
life.”

“Life’s greatest happiness resides in my sister the goddess,” says the 
elder sister. “But you see that every kind of happiness exists here, 
whatever anyone desires. Everyone lives as he wants; each and every 
person has complete will, yes, free will.” 

“What we've shown you will not soon reach its full development in 
the form you've just seen. Many generations will pass before every- 
thing you can now foresee is to be fully realized. No, not many genera- 
tions. My work is progressing quickly, faster with each passing year. 
Nevertheless, you still won't enter into my sister’s completed kingdom. 
But at least you've glimpsed it, and now you know what the future will

be. It's radiant and beautiful. Tell everyone that the future will be 
radiant and beautiful. Love it, strive toward it, work for it, bring it 
nearer, transfer into the present as much as you can from it. To the 
extent that you succeed in doing so, your life will be bright and good, 
rich in joy and pleasure. Strive toward it, work for it, bring it nearer, 
transfer into the present as much as you can from it.”

Within a year the new workshop had been organized and estab- 
lished. The two establishments were closely connected: when one was 
overwhelmed with orders, it would send them to the other if the latter 
had time to fill them. A running account was kept in common between 
them. Their combined resources would prove sufficient to enable 
them to open a shop on Nevsky Prospekt if they could cooperate even 
more. This arrangement cost both Vera Pavlovna and Natasha Mer- 
tsalova considerable trouble. Although the two groups were on friendly 
terms and often entertained each other as guests, and although they 
frequently combined forces for excursions to the countryside, still the 
idea of merging the accounts of two separate enterprises was so new 
that it took a great deal of time and energy to explain it. However, the 
advantage of having a shop on Nevsky was obvious. After a few months 
of worrying about merging the two accounts into one, Vera Pavlovna 
and Natasha Mertsalova succeeded. A new sign appeared on Nevsky 
Prospekt: “Au bon travail. Magasin des Nouveautés.”267 With the open- 
ing of the shop business began to increase more rapidly than before 
and became even more profitable. Natasha Mertsalova and Vera Pav- 
lovna were already dreaming that in two years or so, instead of two 
sewing cooperatives, there might be four or five, then even ten or 
twenty. 

About three months after the store opened, Kirsanov received a visit 
from a colleague with whom he was slightly acquainted. He told Kir- 
sanov a great deal about various medical cases, but most of all about 
the astonishing success of his treatment method, which consisted of 
placing on the patient’s chest and stomach two long, thin bags filled 
with crushed ice wrapped in four napkins.2®8 In conclusion he said 


267. Chernyshevsky uses the name of Vera Pavlovna’s shop, Au bon travail (lit., “At the 
{sign of] good work”), to link her enterprise to the French utopian socialist belief in le 
droit au travail, “the right to work,” proclaimed in such books as Louis Blanc’s Le 
Socialisme: Droit au travail (1848) (see n. 94 above). 

268. Probably a reference to Kh. A. Nordstrem (1818-1885), a physician and adjunct 
professor at the Medical-Surgical Academy who treated all ailments with cold water 
applied in various ways. 


380 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


that one of his acquaintances wished to meet Kirsanov.269 Kirsanov 
agreed to this request. The encounter was amiable; their conversation 
touched on many subjects including the new shop on Nevsky. Kir- 
sanov explained that it had been opened purely for commercial rea- 
sons. They spoke at length about the sign hanging over it. Was it really 
a good idea to include the word travail? Kirsanov said that travail 
means work, and that “Au bon travail” meant a store that filled its 
orders well. They discussed whether it wouldn't be better to replace 
that motto with some surname. Kirsanov explained that his wife's 
Russian surname would be bad for business.?7° At last he offered the 
following solution. His wife’s first name was Vera, which in French is 
foi; would it do to replace “Au bon travail” by “A la bonne foi”? That 
would have only the most innocent meaning, “a conscientious shop,” 
and the owner’s name would actually appear on the sign. After some 
discussion it turned out that this would indeed be acceptable. Kir- 
sanov managed to direct the conversation to such questions with 
particular zeal; in general he succeeded so well that he returned home 
feeling very satisfied. 

In any case Natasha Mertsalova and Vera Pavlovna considerably 
clipped the wings of their own daydreams and concerned themselves 
more with preserving what they had already achieved than with forg- 
ing ahead. 

Thus, in view of the fact that Vera Pavlovna’s and Natasha Mer- 
tsalova’s excessive ardor began to cool, the establishments and the 
shop continued to exist, but not to expand. Still, they rejoiced even in 
the mere fact of this continued existence. Kirsanov’s new acquain- 
tance continued to visit and afforded him a great deal of pleasure. Two 
or more years passed by without any special events.

an interest in it. But the main thing is that perhaps you yourself may find the 
opportunity to do something similar. It’s so pleasant, my friend. 

The thing I want to describe to you is a sewing workshop. In fact, there are 
two of them, both organized along the same lines by a woman I met only two 
weeks ago, but with whom I quickly became friends. I'm now assisting her on 
condition that later she'll help me organize a similar workshop. Her name is 
Vera Pavlovna Kirsanova and she's still young, very kind and cheerful, and 
much to my liking—that is, more like you, Polina, than like me, your humble 
Katya. She's a bold and lively woman. After I learned by chance about her 
workshop (I was told about only one of them), I went directly to her with 
neither an introduction nor a pretext, declaring simply that I was interested in 
it. We took to each other right away, all the more when it turned out that her 
husband, Kirsanov, was the very same doctor who, you'll recall, rendered me 
such great service some five years ago. 

After talking with me for about half an hour and realizing that my sympa- 
thies for such things were genuine, Vera Pavlovna took me into the workshop, 
the one she runs herself (the one established earlier has been taken over by 
one of her close friends, also a very nice young woman). Now I'll share with you 
the impressions of my first visit. They were so novel and striking that I entered 
them in my diary (long since abandoned, but resumed now for a special 
reason that I mayreveal to you later). I'm very glad I wrote them down then, for 
by now I would have forgotten a lot that struck me at the time. Now, only two 
weeks later, it all seems quite ordinary, as if it couldn't be done any other way. 
But the more ordinary it becomes, the more attached I grow to it because it's 
so very good. So, Polina, now begins the excerpt from my diary, supplemented 
by details I’ve learned since. 

A sewing workshop. What do you think I saw there? We stopped at the 
entrance. Vera Pavlovna led me up a very fine staircase—you know, the kind 
where you might be met by a doorman. We climbed up to the third floor. Vera 
Pavlovna rang the bell and I found myself standing in a large hall with a piano 
and very decent furnishings. In a word, it looked as if we'd entered the apart- 
ment of a family earning some four or five thousand rubles a year. “Is this a 
workshop? Is this one of the rooms occupied by seamstresses?” “Well, it's the 
reception room and the hall for evening meetings. Now let's visit the rooms 
where the seamstresses actually live; right now they're in the workrooms and 
we won't disturb anyone.” 

Here's what I saw as we toured the rooms and here's what Vera Pavlovna 
said to me. 

The whole establishment consists of three apartments opening onto one 
landing; these have been converted into one apartment by the addition of 
connecting doors. These apartments used to rent for 700, 550, and 425 rubles a 
year, for a total of 1,675 rubles. But, in letting all three on a five-year lease, the 
owner of the building agreed to reduce the total to 1,250 rubles a year. There 
are twenty-one rooms in the entire workshop, including two very large ones 
with four windows each, one of which serves as the reception room, the other 
as the dining room. Two other large rooms serve as the workrooms; all the 
others are residential. We toured some six or seven rooms in which the girls 


382 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


live (I'm still talking about my first visit there). The furniture in these rooms was 
very presentable, all made of mahogany or walnut. Some rooms have full- 
length mirrors, others have very nice pier glasses;?7! there are several arm- 
chairs and sofas, all well made. The furniture in the various rooms is diverse, 
almost all purchased piecemeal and at low cost. The residential rooms resem- 
ble rooms in the apartments of middle-level officials, senior department 
heads, or young section heads who will soon become department heads. The 
larger rooms are occupied by three girls (in one case four), the others by two 
girls each. 

We entered the workrooms; the girls who were occupied there seemed to be 
dressed like the daughters, sisters, or young wives of these same officials. 
Some wore dresses made of the plainest silk, others wore barege?”* or muslin. 
Their faces reflected the gentleness and tenderness that can come only from a 
life of contentment. You can imagine how all this surprised me. We stayed in 
the workrooms for a long time. There I made the acquaintance of several girls. 
Vera Pavlovna had announced the purpose of my visit. The girls’ level of 
development varied; some used the language of educated society and were 
familiar with literature just as our young ladies are; they even had a decent 
understanding of history and of foreign lands. In other words, they knew 
everything that makes up the ordinary sphere of learning of a young lady in 
our society. Two girls were even very well read. Others who'd joined the 
workshop only recently were less developed, but you could still speak with 
each of them as with a girl who had some education. In general, the level of 
development was in proportion to the length of time each girl had been living 
in the workshop. 

Vera Pavlovna attended to her own business; at times she approached me, 
but I was busy talking with the girls. Thus the time went until dinner. On 
weekdays dinner consists of three courses. That day they served rice soup, 
boiled fish, and veal. After dinner there was a choice of coffee or tea. The meal 
was so good that I ate with gusto and wouldn't have considered it a great 
deprivation to exist on such fare. And you know that my father still employs a 
very fine chef! 

Such were my general impressions on my first visit. I'd been told that I’d see 
a workshop where seamstresses live and that I would be shown their rooms; 
also that I would meet seamstresses and would share their dinner. Instead, | 
visited apartments of people who were reasonably well off, united in one 
establishment. I saw girls like those belonging to middle-level officials or poor 
gentry. I shared their dinner, which, while not lavish, certainly satisfied me. 
What was this all about? How could it be possible? 

When I rejoined Vera Pavlovna, she and her husband explained that there 
was really nothing surprising about what I saw. Meanwhile, as an example, 
Kirsanov jotted down for me on a scrap of paper a rough account that has 
been preserved among the pages of my diary. I'll copy it here for you, but first, 
a few more words. 


271. A large mirror originally used to fill the space between windows. 
272. A thin, light fabric made of silk or cotton. 


What Is to Be Done? 383 


Instead of poverty I saw contentment; instead of filth, not merely cleanli- 
ness, but even some luxury in their rooms; instead of crudeness, considerable 
education. All this came about for two reasons. On the one hand, the seam- 
stresses’ income was increasing; on the other, they'd managed to save a great 
deal on their expenses. 

Do you understand why they receive such a high income? They work for 
themselves; they're the real owners. Therefore they receive the portion of the 
income that otherwise would be the profit extracted by the owner of the 
enterprise. And that’s not all. Working for their own benefit and on their own 
account, they take much better care of materials and they value their time 
more. Their work goes faster and costs less. 

Obviously they realize a great savings in their living expenses. They buy 
everything in large quantities and pay cash because they get things cheaper 
than buying on credit or at retail prices. Items are chosen carefully, with 
considerable expertise and only after many inquiries; therefore not only is 
everything cheaper, but it's also of better quality than poor people can usually 
afford. 

In addition, many other expenses are either drastically reduced or com- 
pletely unnecessary. Consider this, for example. To walk two or three versts a 
day to the store puts extra wear and tear on shoes and clothes. The following 
example is trivial, but it can be applied to other things of the same sort. If you 
don't own an umbrella, your dress can suffer major damage as a result of rain. 
Now listen to what Vera Pavlovna told me. Let's say a simple cotton umbrella 
costs two rubles. There are twenty-five seamstresses in the workshop. Um- 
brellas for all would cost fifty rubles. Anyone who didn't have one would face a 
loss much greater than two rubles. But since they live together and each one 
goes out only when it’s convenient, in bad weather it rarely happens that 
many of them have to leave the house at the same time. They found that five 
umbrellas would be quite enough. These five umbrellas are of fine silk and cost 
five rubles apiece. The total expenditure on umbrellas was twenty-five rubles, 
or one ruble per seamstress. You see, each one gets to use a fine umbrella 
instead of a worthless one for only half the price. So it is with a large number of 
items, which together result in major savings. It's the same with their apart- 
ment and their board. For example, the dinner I described to you cost be- 
tween 5 rubles 50 kopecks and 5 rubles 75 kopecks, including bread but not 
coffee or tea. There were 37 people at the table (not counting Vera Pavlovna 
and myself), although a few children were included in that total. Five rubles 
and 75 kopecks for 37 people comes to less than 16 kopecks per person and 
less than 5 rubles a month. Vera Pavlovna says that if a person were to dine 
alone on that amount of money, he could have scarcely anything but some 
bread and the poor stuff sold in some small shops. In an eating establishment 
such a dinner (but not so well prepared) would cost, according to Vera Pavlov- 
na, roughly 40 kopecks (for 30 kopecks the quality would be considerably 
worse). The difference is understandable: the proprietor of an eating house 
who prepares dinner for twenty people or fewer must support himself on the 
money he receives, rent an apartment, and hire help. But here these extra 
expenses are either nonexistent or greatly reduced. A salary for two old wom- 


384 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


en, both relatives of the seamstresses, is the entire cost of maintaining a 
kitchen staff. Now you'll understand the account that Kirsanov jotted down as 
an example when I visited there the first time. After he'd written it all out, he 
explained: 

“Of course, I can't give you exact figures, and it would be hard to find them 
because, as you know, every commercial enterprise, every store, and every 
workshop has its own ratio between items of debit and credit, just as every 
household has its own way of economizing to keep track of all its expenses 
and its own ratio. I’m putting down these rough figures as an example. But so 
that this account will appear more convincing, I'll use figures that underesti- 
mate the advantages of our establishment in comparison with the actual 
expenses of almost any commercial enterprise and any poor small household. 

“The income that a commercial enterprise receives from the sale of its 
goods,” continued Kirsanov, “is divided into three main parts. One part goes to 
pay workers' salaries, the second for other expenses (including rent, light, and 
raw materials), and the third is the owner’s profit. Let's suppose that receipts 
are divided among these parts in the following way: workers ' salaries, one-half; 
other expenses (overhead), one-quarter; and profit, one-quarter. This means 
that if the workers receive a salary of one hundred rubles, fifty go to pay for 
other expenses and fifty go to the proprietor as profit. Let's see how much the 
workers in our establishment receive.” Kirsanov began to read off his own 
figures: 


They receive a salary ... 100 rubles 
They are the owners, so they receive the pro- 
prietor’s profit ... 50 rubles 


Their workspace is located in the apartment, 
so it costs less than a separate workshop; 
they conserve raw materials; in these ways 
they realize a large proportion of the sav- 
ings, approximately one-half, but let’s say 
only about one-third. Out of fifty rubles 
designated for these expenses, they receive 
in income an additional . . . 16 rubles 
67 kopecks 


Total 166 rubles 
67 kopecks 


“Now we Can see,’ continued Kirsanov, “that our workers receive 166 rubles 
and 67 kopecks, whereas at any other establishment they receive only 100 
rubles. But our workers get even more. Working for their own benefit, they do 
so diligently, hence faster and more productively. Let’s assume that given their 
ordinary poor motivation they used to produce five items (for our purposes, 
let's say five dresses). Now they can make six; this figure is too low, but we'll 
use it anyway. That means that in the time it takes another establishment to 
earn five rubles, ours makes six. 


What Is to Be Done? 385 


As a result of the increased productivi- 
ty, the receipts and income increase by 
one-fifth: thus, 1/5 of 166 rubles and 67 
kopecks equals 33 rubles and 33 


kopecks. 33 rubles 33 kopecks 
added to the previous 166 rubles 67 kopecks 
Total 200 rubles 


“Therefore, our seamstresses receive twice the income of others,” continued 
Kirsanov. “Now, how is it used? Having twice the income, they use it much 
more profitably. There’s a double advantage, as you know. First, everything is 
purchased wholesale. Let's assume that they save about one-third in this way; 
that is, things that would cost three rubles in small retail shops or on credit 
cost them only two rubles. In fact, the advantage is even greater. Let's take the 
apartment as an example. If space in these rooms were rented separately to 
individuals, three or four people would live in each of the seventeen rooms 
with two windows—fifty-five people in all. Six people would live in each of the 
two rooms with three windows, and 9 in each of the two rooms with four 
windows, that is, 12 plus 18, fora total of 30, plus 55 in the smaller rooms, fora 
grand total of 85 people in the whole apartment. Each person would pay 3 
rubles 50 kopecks a month, or 42 rubles a year. Therefore, the small landlords 
who make a business of renting separate spaces in each room would take in 
for the entire establishment a total of 42 rubles times 85 people, or 3,570 rubles. 
Our seamstresses payonly 1,250 rubles a yearfor this apartment, that is, about 
one-third that amount. It’s the same or almost the same for other things, 
almost for everything. I probably wouldn't even come close to the true figure 
even if I increased the amount of savings to one-half, but I'll leave it at one- 
third. And that’s still not all! Given the structure of their life, the seamstresses 
have no need to incur major expenses and they require many fewer things. 
Verochka has provided you with a good example: shoes and clothes. Let's 
suppose that as a result the quantity of purchased items is reduced by one- 
fourth. Instead of four pairs of shoes, three will suffice; three dresses are worn 
as long as four used to be. This ratio is still too small, but let's see what savings 
result: 


Economy of purchase results in a sav- 
ings of one-third; that is, suppose that 
for three things we spend only two 
rubles instead of three. Given our sys- 
tem, these three things satisfy as many 
needs as at least four in the old system. 
That means that for their two hundred 
rubles our seamstresses have as many 
things as could have been had under 
the old system for 300 rubles; and it 
means that under our system, these 


386 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


things provide them with just as much 
comfort as would have been provided 
in the old system by a sum of no less 
than... 400 rubles. 


“Compare the life of a family spending a thousand rubles a year with that of 
a family spending four thousand. Wouldn't you expect to find an enormous 
difference?” asked Kirsanov. “In our system the proportion is just about the 
same, if not more. We receive twice as much income and it’s used twice as 
profitably. Is it surprising that you find the life of our seamstresses very differ- 
ent from the one lived by people under the old order?” 

Those are the sort of marvels I saw, my friend Polina, and that's how easily it 
can all be explained. I've grown so accustomed to it now it seems strange that I 
was ever surprised by it. How is it that I didn't expect to find it all just the way 
it is? Write me whether you might have the opportunity to join me in what I'm 
now preparing to do, namely, organize a sewing workshop or something 
similar according to this system. It’s so very pleasant, Polina. 

Yours, 
K. Potozova 


P.S. I completely forgot to tell you about the other workshop, but no matter; I'll 
do so next time. Now suffice it to say that the senior workshop has branched 
out even more, and as a result is in all respects far ahead of the one I've 
described to you. There are many differences between them in the details of 
their organization because everything is adjusted to suit individual circum- 
stances. 


CHAPTER FIVE 


New Characters and the Conclusion 


In the letter to her friend, Katya Polozova mentioned that she was 
very grateful to Vera Pavlovna’s husband. In order to explain why, I 
have to describe the kind of person her father was. 

Polozov was a retired cavalry captain or staff captain;273 while in the 
service, and according to the customs of the good old days, he led a 
dissipated life and squandered a rather large ancestral estate. When 
he had done so, he came to his senses, resigned his commission, and 
settled down to earn himself a new fortune. Having collected his few 
remaining crumbs, he realized that he had about ten thousand rubles 
left in banknotes;274 he started a small business in the retail grain 
trade. He began to accept all sorts of small contracts, pursuing every 
profitable deal he could, and in about ten years he had accumulated 
considerable capital. With a reputation as a sound and shrewd man, 
with his rank, and with a name well known in the vicinity, he could 
choose as his bride any of the merchants’ daughters in the two dis- 
tricts where he did business. He chose wisely, one with a dowry of 
about half a million rubles, also in banknotes. He was then about fifty 
years old; in other words, this was about twenty years before we see 
his daughter embarking on her friendship with Vera Pavlovna. After 
adding such a large sum to his own fortune, he broadened the scope 
of his business. Within the next ten years he became a millionaire in 


273. In Russian, rotmistr and shtab-rotmistr, the relatively modest eighth and ninth 
positions in the table of military ranks (see n. 7 above). 

274. That is, assignat rubles (assignatsii), the paper currency first introduced by the 
government in 1768-1769 to cover increased state expenses. The excessive issue of 
assignatsii led to their depreciation, so that by 1839 3.6 assignat rubles equaled one silver 
ruble. 


387

silver rubles, which were then the preferred currency.2”7> His wife 
passed away; having been accustomed to provincial life, she’d kept 
him from settling in Petersburg. But now he moved to the capital. His 
business prospered even more, and in another ten years he was said 
to be in possession of some three or four million rubles. Spinsters and 
widows, both young and old, set their caps for him, but he didn’t want 
to marry a second time—partly because of loyalty to the memory of 
his late wife, but more because he didn’t want to impose a stepmother 
on his daughter Katya, whom he loved very much. 

Polozov continued to get on in the world; he would have had ten 
million instead of three or four if he’d gone in for tax farming,?76 but he 
felt an aversion to it and considered that only contracts and supplies 
were honest business. His fellow millionaires made fun of these subtle 
distinctions and they were not wrong. But he, even though he was 
wrong, clung to his opinion. “I’m engaged in commerce,” he said. “I 
don’t want to get rich by robbing.” But about a year or so before his 
daughter made Vera Pavlovna’s acquaintance, he was furnished with 
all too clear a demonstration that his commerce was essentially no 
different from tax farming, even though he thought it was. He had a 
huge contract for canvas, or provisions, or shoe leather—I don’t re- 
member which. With every passing year he’d become more stubborn 
and arrogant as a result of his age, his continued success, and the 
growing universal respect for him. Then he quarreled with a certain 
useful person. He flew into a rage, insulted him, and the whole thing 
turned ugly. After a week he was told, “Give it up.” “I won't,” he said. 
“You'll go broke,” they said. “Perhaps,” he said, “but I still won't.” After 
a month he was told the same thing, and he replied similarly. Indeed, 
he didn’t give it up, but he went broke anyway. The merchandise was 
rejected; beside that, whether genuine offenses had been committed 
or merely intended, Polozov's three or four million rubles vanished. At 
the age of sixty he became a poor man, that is, poor compared to what 
he had been. Comparisons aside, he was still reasonably well off. He 
retained a share of a stearine factory.277 Not the least bit dejected, he 
became the manager of this factory and received a good salary. In 
addition, by a stroke of luck there remained several tens of thousands 
of rubles. If he’d been left with such a sum fifteen or even ten years 
ago, it would have been enough for him to scale still another sizable 
peak. But at the age of sixty it’s much harder to rise in the world; 


275. The currency reform of 1839 recognized the silver ruble as the basic monetary 
unit of the state. 

276. See n. 72 above. 

277. A substance obtained from animal or vegetable fats and used to make soap, 
candles, and similar products. 


What Is to Be Done? 389 


Polozov decided that it was too late to attempt such a feat and that he 
lacked the strength. He thought only about arranging the sale of the 
factory as soon as possible, since his shares in it provided little in- 
come, and the factory, itself without any credit, was beyond rescue. 
He'd diagnosed the affair intelligently and managed to persuade the 
other major shareholders that a speedy sale was the only means of 
saving the money invested in the shares. He also thought about marry- 
ing off his daughter. But the main thing was to sell the factory, convert 
all his money into 5 percent bonds (which were then becoming very 
fashionable), and live out the rest of his days in peace, recollecting his 
past glory; he’d not only bravely endured its loss but even managed to 
retain his good cheer and his firmness.

Her father loved Katya and didn't allow any snobbish high-society 
governesses to hobble the girl too severely. “That's nonsense,” he used 
to say about any correction to her waistline, her manners, or anything 
else. When Katya was fifteen he even agreed with her that they could 
get along splendidly without any English or French governesses. Thus 
Katya relaxed and began to enjoy complete freedom at home. For 
Katya that meant that no one would interfere with her reading or 
dreaming. She had very few friends, only two or three close ones, but 
there was no end of suitors. Polozov had only one daughter and—one 
shudders to think—four million rubles! 

But Katya read and dreamed, while the suitors despaired. She was 
already seventeen. So she read and dreamed, but didn’t fall in love. 
Instead she began to grow thin and pale; then she took to her bed. 


ili. 


Although Kirsanov didn’t maintain an active practice, he didn't be- 
lieve that he had a right to refuse to attend consultations. About that 
time, a year or so after he became a professor and about a year before 
he married Vera Pavlovna, the luminaries among the Petersburg practi- 
tioners began to invite him, all too frequently, to assist them in their 
consultations. There were two reasons. First, it turned out that there 
really was someone named Claude Bernard who was alive and living 
in Paris.278 One of the luminaries, who journeyed to Paris for God 


278. See n. 119 above. 


390 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


knows what worthy scientific reason, had actually seen Claude Ber- 
nard with his own eyes, that is, the real one in flesh and blood. He 
introduced himself by rank, title, medals, and famous patients; after 
listening to him for half an hour, Claude Bernard replied, “There was 
no need for you to come to Paris to study recent advances in medicine. 
In fact, there’s no reason to leave Petersburg for that purpose.” The 
luminary took this as a testament to his own pursuits; upon his return 
to Petersburg he mentioned Claude Bernard no fewer than ten times a 
day, adding at least five times the phrase “my learned friend” or “my 
distinguished colleague.” After this, how could he fail to invite Kir- 
sanov to attend consultations? It was unthinkable! 

The second reason was even more important. All the luminaries 
realized that Kirsanov would never try to take away their patients. Not 
only wouldn't he do so, but he'd refuse to take cases even when they 
begged him to. It’s well known that many big-time practitioners sub- 
scribe to the following custom: if, in their opinion, a patient is faced 
with the approach of an inevitable demise, and if, by some stroke of 
bad luck, the doctor is unable to get rid of the patient by sending him 
to take the waters or travel abroad, then he'll usually try to palm him 
off on another doctor, even offering the latter money: “Here . . . this is 
foryou.. .just take him!” Kirsanov rarely accepted patients on request 
from a doctor who was merely trying to escape. He usually recom- 
mended one of his friends engaged in private practice, reserving for 
himself only a few cases that were particularly interesting from a sci- 
entific point of view. How then could one not include such a colleague 
who was both known to Claude Bernard and who never tried to take 
away one’s patients? 

Polozov the millionaire had as his doctor the biggest of these lumin- 
aries. When Katerina Vasilievna became dangerously ill, the consul- 
tants consisted exclusively of other luminaries. At last, when the case 
became very serious, the luminaries decided to call in Kirsanov. In- 
deed, they were confronted by a very difficult problem. The patient 
showed no signs of any known illness, yet her strength was failing 
rapidly. Some disease had to be found. The attending physician finally 
came up with atrophia nervorum, “the suspension of nervous nutri- 
tion.” I don’t know whether such a disease exists in the whole world or 
not, but if it does, I’m sure it must be incurable. If, in spite of its 
incurability, the patient must still be treated, let Kirsanov or one of his 
young upstart friends do it. 

So there was another consultation, this time with Kirsanov in atten- 
dance. They examined the patient and interrogated her. She answered 
willingly and very calmly. After her first few words, Kirsanov stood to 
one side and watched as the luminaries continued their examination 


What Is to Be Done? 391 


and interrogation. When they’d exhausted themselves and tortured 
the patient as much as propriety demands on such occasions, they 
turned to Kirsanov and asked, “What do you think, Alexander Mat- 
veich?” He replied, “I haven’t examined the patient sufficiently. I'll stay 
here. It’s an interesting case. If I need another consultation, I'll tell Karl 
Fedorych,” that is, the attending physician, whose face was radiating 
joy at having been rescued from his atrophia nervorum. 

When everyone else left, Kirsanov sat down next to the patient's bed. 
She smiled sarcastically. 

“It’s a pity we're not acquainted,” he began. “A doctor must have his 
patient’s trust. Perhaps I’ll succeed in earning yours. They don’t un- 
derstand your illness; it requires a certain sagacity. There's no point in 
sounding your chest or prescribing various medicines. Only one thing 
is necessary: to understand your situation and to explore it together to 
see if something can be done. Will you help me do that?” 

The patient was silent. 

“You don't wish to talk to me?” 

The patient was silent. 

“You probably even want me to leave. I ask you for only ten minutes. 
If in ten minutes you still consider my presence here as useless as you 
do now, then I'll leave. Do you know that you have no disorder except 
for grief? Do you realize that if your present mental condition is al- 
lowed to continue, in two or three weeks, perhaps even less, it may be 
impossible to save you? Perhaps you won't even last that long. Con- 
sumption hasn't set in yet, but it’s imminent, and at your age, under 
such circumstances, it develops with extraordinary speed and could 
carry you off in a matter of days.” 

The patient was silent. 

“You make no reply. You remain indifferent. That means that noth- 
ing I've said is new to you. The fact that you're silent indicates that you 
agree. Do you know what almost anyone else would do in my place? 
Speak with your father. Perhaps a conversation with him might even 
save your life. But, if your prefer, I won't do that. Why? I make it a rule 
that nothing should ever be done to help a person against his own 
will. Freedom comes before everything else, even life itself. Therefore, if 
you'd rather I didn’t discover the reason for your dangerous condition, 
I won't. If you say that you want to die, I ask only that you explain the 
reasons to me. If they seem unfounded, I still won’t have any right to 
interfere. If they seem well founded, I'll be obligated to assist you, and 
I'm prepared to do so. I’m ready to provide you with poison. On these 
conditions, then, I ask you to tell me the reason for your illness.” 

The patient was silent. 

“You'd rather not answer. Then I have no right to continue these 


392 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


inquiries. But may I ask your permission to tell you something about 
myself that may serve to increase the trust between us? Yes? Thank 
you. Whatever the reason, you're suffering. So am I. I'm passionately in 
love with a woman who doesn’t know and must never find out that I 
love her. Do you pity me?” 

The patient was silent, but she smiled sadly. 

“You say nothing, but you couldn't conceal the fact that you noticed 
these last words of mine more than any previous ones. That’s enough. 
I can see that you and I share the same cause of our suffering. You 
prefer to die. I can understand that very well. But death from con- 
sumption is slow and painful. I'm prepared to help you die, if I can't 
help you in any other way. I'm telling you that I’m ready to provide 
you with poison—a splendid potion, fast-acting and utterly painless. 
On this condition are you willing to provide me with the means of 
determining whether your predicament is as hopeless as it seems to 
you?” 

“You won't deceive me?” asked the patient. 

“Look me straight in the eye and you'll see that I won't deceive you.” 

The patient hesitated for some time. 

“No, I don’t know you well enough.” 

“Anyone else in my place might have said that the feeling that tor- 
ments you is a good thing. I won't say that yet. Does your father know 
about it? Remember, without your permission I won't speak to him.” 

“He doesn’t know.” 

“Does he love you?” 

“Yes.” 

“What do you think I'll say next? You say that he loves you; I've 
heard that he’s not a stupid man. What makes you think there’s noth- 
ing to be gained from revealing your feelings to him? Do you think he 
won't consent? If poverty were the only obstacle in the man you love, 
that wouldn't prevent you from trying to win your father's consent. 
That’s what I think. In other words, you suppose that your father 
doesn't think well of him; there can be no other reason for silence 
before your father. Isn't that so?” 

The patient was silent. 

“Clearly, I'm not mistaken. What do I think now? Your father’s a 
person with considerable life experience and one who knows people. 
You're inexperienced. If a particular person seems good to you but 
bad to him, then in all probability you're making a mistake and not he. 
You realize that I must think that. Do you want to know why I'm saying 
something so unpleasant? I'll tell you. You may get angry at my words, 
even hate me for saying them, but you will say to yourself: ‘He says 
what he thinks. He doesn't pretend or try to deceive me.’ I'm winning 
your trust. Isn’t it true that I'm being honest with you?” 


What Is to Be Done? 393 


The patient hesitated as to whether to answer or not. 

“Youre a very strange man, doctor,” she said at last. 

“No, not strange, merely not a hypocrite. I say just what I think. But 
this is only my hypothesis. Perhaps I’m mistaken. Give me the oppor- 
tunity to find out. Tell me the name of the man you love. Then, and 
once again, only if you allow it, I'll speak to your father about him.” 

“What will you say to him?” 

“Does he know him well?” 

“Yes.” 

“In that case I'll advise him to consent to your marriage only on one 
condition: that a date for the wedding be set not at once, but in two or 
three months, so that you will have time to consider carefully whether 
your father may be right.” 

“He won't agree to that.” 

“In all probability he will. If not, I'll help you as I said I would.” 

Kirsanov went on in this manner for some time. At last he managed 
to get the patient to tell him the man’s name and to allow him to speak 
with her father. However, it was even harder to handle the old man. 
Polozov was astonished to learn that his daughter's health was failing 
as a result of hopeless love; he was even more astonished to discover 
the name of the man she loved. He firmly declared, “Let her die rather 
than marry him! Death would be a lesser misfortune both for her and 
for me.” This was a very difficult case, all the more so because upon 
hearing Polozov’s reasons, Kirsanov realized that truth was actually on 
the side of the old man and not that of his daughter. 


iv. 


Suitors by the hundreds swarm around the heiress of an enormous 
fortune; but the society that flocked to Polozov's dinners and parties 
was of that highly dubious type, of that excessively suspicious ele- 
gance that fills the halls of wealthy people such as Polozov, elevated 
above their own more or less decent but still not high-society circle, 
and possessing neither relatives nor connections in genuine, also 
more or less decent high society. They become the benefactors of 
scoundrels and fops lacking in external polish, not to mention internal 
worth. Therefore, Katerina Vasilievna was intrigued when, among the 
throngs of her admirers, there appeared a genuine society fellow of 
absolutely good breeding. His behavior was so much more elegant 
than that of all the others, his speech so much cleverer and more 
entertaining. Her father noticed very early on that she had begun to 
show preference for him above the rest. Being a businesslike person, a 
firm and decisive man, as soon as he noticed, he had a talk with his 


394 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


daughter. “My dear Katya, Solovtsov is pursuing you relentlessly. Be- 
ware of him. He’s a very bad man, utterly heartless. You'd be so unhap- 
py with him that I'd sooner see you dead than his wife; it would be 
easier both for you and for me.” 

Katerina Vasilievna loved her father and was used to respecting his 
wishes. He never put any restrictions on her. She knew that he was 
speaking only out of love for her. But the main thing was that she was 
the sort of person who tends to think more about the wishes of those 
who love her than about her own caprices. She was one of those 
people who love to say to their nearest and dearest, “I'll do as you 
think best.” She answered her father, “I like Solovtsov, but if you think 
it’s better for me to keep away from him, I will.” 

Of course, she wouldn't have done so, nor, since by her very nature 
she was unable to lie, would she have said so, if she’d really loved him. 
But her affection for Solovtsov was still very weak, almost nonexistent 
at the time. He was merely more interesting than the others. She began 
to treat him coolly; everything might even have turned out all right, 
except that her father, in his fervor, had overdone it. Not by much, but 
it was enough for the cunning Solovtsov. He realized that he should 
now play the role of victim. How could he find a pretext for doing so? 
Then Polozov made a caustic remark at his expense. Solovtsov took his 
leave, his sense of self-respect intact, a look of sorrow in his eye, and 
ceased his visits. In a week Katerina Vasilievna received a passionate 
and extremely humble letter from him, to the effect that he’d never 
expected to have his love reciprocated. His happiness, he said, con- 
sisted merely of seeing her occasionally, not even talking to her, mere- 
ly seeing her. But, he said, he was willing to sacrifice even that happi- 
ness, and would still be happy, or unhappy, and so on and so forth. He 
made no requests and had no desires. He didn’t even ask for a reply. 
Several other letters followed in the same vein; at last they produced 
their effect. 

But not very quickly. When Solovtsov ceased his visits, Katerina Vas- 
ilievna was neither sad nor pensive at first. Even before that she'd been 
somewhat cold to him, so she'd taken her father’s advice to avoid him 
very calmly. Therefore, two months later when she became so sad, 
how could her father possibly imagine that Solovtsov was involved? 
He'd forgotten all about him! 

“You seem a little sad, Katya.” 

“No, it’s nothing. I’m all right.” In a week or two her father asked, 
“Are you ill, Katya?” 

“No, it’s nothing.” 

Two weeks later her father said, “You really must see a doctor, 
Katya.” 


What Is to Be Done? 395 


Katya began to be treated by a doctor. The old man was greatly 
relieved when the doctor found nothing seriously wrong with her, 
only a certain weakness and exhaustion, which he confidently at- 
tributed to the life Katerina Vasilievna had led last winter—attending a 
party every evening until two or three a.m., often until five a.m. This 
exhaustion would pass. But it didn’t; it got worse. 

Why didn't Katerina Vasilievna say anything to her father? She was 
sure it would do no good. Her father had been so firm with her that 
day; and he never wastes words. He doesn't like to express his opin- 
ions about people unless he’s firmly convinced. He would never con- 
sent to her marrying someone he considered to be a bad person. 

So Katerina Vasilieyna dreamed and fantasized, reading Solovtsov's 
modest, hopeless letters, and after reading them for half a year or so, 
she stood one step away from consumption. Not from a single word 
could her father tell that her illness was caused by something for 
which he was partly to blame. His daughter was as affectionate to him 
as before. 

“Are you unhappy about something?” 

“No, papa.” 

“Are you upset about something?” 

“No, papa.” 

Clearly, she wasn’t. She was merely depressed, but that was a result 
of her weakness, her illness. Even the doctor confirmed that. But why 
was She ill? As long as the doctor considered it unimportant, he was 
content to blame dances and corsets. But when he detected danger, 
then it was time for atrophia nervorum, “the suspension of nervous 
nutrition.” 


Vv. 


But if the practicing luminaries were in agreement that Mademoi- 
selle Polozova was suffering from atrophia nervorum as a result of the 
exhausting life she led, in contrast to her natural inclination toward 
reverie and pensiveness, Kirsanov needed to spend very little time 
examining the patient to determine that her decline was due to some 
moral cause. Before the consultation the attending physician had out- 
lined the patient's situation for him: there were no disagreements 
within the family—the father got on well with his daughter. Mean- 
while, the father had absolutely no idea what was causing the distress 
because the attending physician had none either. What on earth was 
going on? It was clear that the girl had considerable character, since 
she’d managed to conceal her distress for so long and since she’d 


396 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


given her father no opportunity to guess its cause. Her character was 
most apparent in the serene tone of her replies during the consulta- 
tion. There wasn’t a trace of irritation; she was enduring her fate 
stoically. Kirsanov realized that such a girl deserved his attention. 
Could he possibly help her? Of course, one way or another, this whole 
affair would be resolved someday, even without his intervention. But 
would it then be too late? Consumption was imminent; then no 
amount of solicitude would help. 

He struggled with her for two hours or so until he succeeded in 
winning her confidence. He found out what the problem was and 
received her permission to have a talk with her father. 

The old man was astonished to hear from Kirsanov that his daugh- 
ter’s love for Solovtsov was the cause of her illness. How could that be? 
Katya had taken his advice to stop seeing him so coolly and she'd 
seemed so indifferent when Solovtsov ceased his visits. How could she 
be dying of love for him? And can one really die of love? Such exalta- 
tion could not appear credible to a man accustomed to leading an 
exceptionally practical life and one used to regarding everything with 
cool common sense. Kirsanov spent a long time talking to him, but he 
kept repeating, “It’s the child’s fantasy. She'll suffer a bit and then 
she'll forget.” Kirsanov went on explaining again and again and finally 
convinced him that it was precisely because she was a child that she 
would not forget and was about to die. Polozov understood and was 
convinced. But instead of yielding, he struck his fist on the table and 
said with intense determination: “If she dies, she dies, let her die. 
That’s better than her being unhappy. It will be better both for her and 
for me!” These were the very same words he'd used with his daughter 
only half a year before. Katerina Vasilievna hadn't been mistaken in 
thinking that there was no use talking to him. 

“Why do you object so? I believe you that he’s a bad person, but is he 
really so worthless that life with him would be even worse than 
death?” 

“Yes, he is. He has no soul. She’s kind and gentle, while he’s a 
depraved louse.” Polozov launched into a long description of Solovtsov 
and painted a picture so bleak that Kirsanov couldn't object. And 
indeed, how could he help but agree with Polozov? Solovtsov was 
none other than that very same Jean with whom, once upon a time, 
before Storeshnikov’s courtship, he’d supped after the opera, together 
with Serge and Julie.279 It was absolutely true that it would have been 
better for a decent girl to die than become such a fellow’s wife. He 
would pollute her, stifle her, and devour her with his loathsomeness. 
It would be much better for her to die. 


279. See pp. 59-64 above. 


What Is to Be Done? 397 


Kirsanov lapsed into thought for several minutes. 

“No,” he said at last. “Why have I been taken in by your eloquence? 
There's no real danger here precisely because the fellow is so bad. She 
can't help but realize this if only she’s given enough time to look at 
him calmly.” Insistently he began to explain his plan. Earlier Kirsanov 
had said to Polozov's daughter, merely as a hypothesis, perhaps even 
an erroneous one, that she herself would reject her beloved if he really 
was unworthy. Now Kirsanov was absolutely convinced that she 
would do so precisely because the beloved was so very wicked. 

“I won't argue that marriage is not so terribly important if one re- 
gards it dispassionately. When a wife’s unhappy, why shouldn't she 
leave her husband? You consider this solution unacceptable. Your 
daughter was raised with those same ideas, so that for both of you it 
would truly inflict an irretrievable loss. Before she could ever be reedu- 
cated, she'd suffer with such a man until she died a death far worse 
than that caused by consumption. But one must approach this from a 
different angle. Why not rely on your daughter's good common sense? 
She's not insane, is she? Always rely on reason, but allow it to operate 
freely; it'll never fail when the cause is just. You yourself are to blame. 
You've placed chains on your daughter’s reason; remove them, and it 
will lead her over to your side if truth is there. Passion blinds a person 
when it encounters obstacles. Remove them and your daughter will 
become reasonable again. Give her the freedom to love or not and 
she'll see whether the man is worthy of her love. Let her become his 
fiancée and in a short time she herself will reject him.” 

This way of looking at things was still too novel for Polozov. He 
replied sharply that he didn't believe such nonsense; he knew life too 
well. He'd seen too many examples of people's stupidity to rely on 
their reason, let alone that of a seventeen-year-old girl. In vain Kir- 
sanov objected that foolish acts are committed only in two cases: 
either in the heat ofthe moment, a fleeting burst of passion, or when a 
person is deprived of freedom and is irritated by restraint. These ideas 
were absolute nonsense to Polozov. “She’s mad. It would be stupid to 
entrust a child with her own fate. It would be better to let her die.” 
There was no way to disabuse him of these arguments. 

Of course, no matter how fixed the ideas of a man in the wrong, if 
another man, more developed, more knowledgeable, and more under- 
standing, constantly works to lead him into the light, his errors can't 
hold out for long. That’s certain. But how much time would the mental 
battle require? Naturally even this conversation couldn't pass without 
producing results. Although hardly any immediate impact on Polozov 
could be detected, the old man would soon begin to reflect on Kir- 
sanov's words—that was inevitable. And if one were to continue hav- 
ing such conversations with him, he'd eventually change his mind. But 


398 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


he was both experienced and proud of it and considered himself 
infallible; he was set in his ways and very stubborn. One could un- 
doubtedly talk some sense into him, but not very quickly. Any delay 
would be dangerous. A long delay would probably prove fatal, yet such 
a delay was undoubtedly inevitable in a methodically intelligent strug- 
gle with him. 

Kirsanov would have to resort to more radical means. It involved a 
risk, that was true; but with it, there was merely risk, whereas without 
it, there was certain death. Besides, the risk wasn’t really as great as it 
would appear to a person any less firm than Kirsanov in his convic- 
tions about the laws governing human life. The risk wasn’t that great at 
all. But it was serious. In this lottery there’s only one losing ticket. 
There was almost no likelihood that it would turn up, but what if it 
did? One who takes a risk must be prepared to accept the conse- 
quences unflinchingly if the losing ticket turns up. Kirsanov observed 
the girl’s calm, silent strength and was sure of her. But did he have the 
right to subject her to such a risk? Of course. As things stood, out of a 
hundred chances, there was only one that she wouldn't destroy her 
health in this whole business, and there was more than a fifty-fifty 
chance that she'd quickly die. But this way, out of a thousand chances, 
only one would be against her. Let her take her chances in the lot- 
tery—seemingly it was more terrifying because it was quicker, but it 
really was incomparably less dangerous. 

“All right,” said Kirsanov. “You don’t want me to treat her by any 
means at your disposal. I'll have to resort to my own. Tomorrow I'll call 
for another consultation.” 

He returned to the patient and informed her that her father was a 
very stubborn man indeed—more so than he'd expected—and that it 
would be necessary to confront him in a very drastic manner. 

“No, nothing will help,” said the patient sadly. 

“Are you sure?” 

“Yes.” 

“Are you ready to die?” 

“Yes.” 

“What if I decide to subject you to the risk of death? I mentioned this 
before in passing to win your trust and to demonstrate that I was 
prepared to do anything to help you. Now I'm talking about it se- 
riously. What if I have to provide you with poison?” 

“I've known for some time that my death was inevitable and that I 
had only a few days left to live.” 

“What if it’s tomorrow morning?” 

“The sooner the better.” She spoke very calmly. When only one 
means of salvation remains, that is, to summon up one’s own readi- 


What Is to Be Done? 399 


ness to die, then one almost always succeeds. If you say, “Give in or I'll 
die,” a person almost always gives in. But one must never make light of 
such a great principle as this. Nor can one lower one’s self-respect; if 
the others don't give in, then one must really die. He explained his 
plan to her, one that was quite comprehensible from this discussion 
alone. 


vi. 


Of course, in any similar case Kirsanov would never have considered 
running such a risk. It would have been much simpler: remove the girl 
from the household and let her marry whom she wished. But here 
everything was complicated by the girl’s own ideas and by the charac- 
ter of the man she loved. Given her view of the indissolubility of mar- 
riage, she would have stuck with the wretch even after realizing that 
life with him was a torment. To unite them in marriage would be 
worse than killing her. Therefore, only one option remained—either 
kill her or give her the chance to come to her senses. 

The next day they held a consultation. It consisted of the luminaries 
of high-society medical practice—five in all, each among the most 
distinguished. How else could one make an impression on Polozov? It 
was essential that the verdict be announced to him without any pos- 
sibility of appeal. Kirsanov spoke; everyone listened gravely to what he 
said and gravely nodded their heads. What else could they do? After 
all, you'll recall that Claude Bernard was alive and living in Paris. 
Besides that, Kirsanov was saying such strange things—devil take 
these young whippersnappers—that no one could understand a word 
he said. What else could they do but nod their heads? 

Kirsanov said that he’d examined the patient very thoroughly and 
was in total agreement with Karl Fedorych that her illness was incur- 
able. The patient’s suffering would be horrendous; in fact, each addi- 
tional hour she lived entailed superfluous torment. Therefore, he con- 
sidered it the obligation of the consulting physicians to resolve, out of 
love for their fellow man, to curtail the patient's suffering by admin- 
istering a dose of morphine from which she would never awaken. 
Having announced such a solution, he invited the doctors to examine 
the patient once more in order to confirm or reject this opinion. The 
physicians did so, with considerable blinking of eyes under the bar- 
rage of Kirsanov's diabolically unintelligible explanations. They with- 
drew to the large hall, far away from the patient's room; there they 
confirmed Kirsanov's decision to curtail the patient's suffering by ad- 
ministering a fatal dose of morphine. 


400 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


After reaching this decision, Kirsanov dispatched a servant to invite 
Polozov into the consultation hall. Polozov entered. The gravest of 
sages announced the doctors’ decision in appropriately solemn and 
gloomy language and in majestically somber tones. 

Polozov was thunderstruck. To expect death, even fairly soon, not 
knowing when or whether it would come, was one thing, but to hear 
that in half an hour she'd no longer be alive was altogether different. 
Kirsanov fixed Polozov with an intense stare. He was absolutely con- 
vinced of the impact, but the entire affair was still a strain on his 
nerves. For two minutes or so the old man stood in stunned silence. 
“No, it must not be! She’s dying because of my stubbornness. I'll con- 
sent to anything. Will she recover?” “Of course,” replied Kirsanov. 

The luminaries would have been very angry if they'd had the time, 
that is, the time to exchange glances and realize that they and all their 
colleagues had been puppets in the hands of this young whippersnap- 
per; but Kirsanov allowed them no time to wonder “how the others 
perceive me.” After he instructed the servant to lead away the droop- 
ing Polozov, he thanked them all for the perspicacity with which 
they'd divined his intention, having understood that the cause of her 
illness was moral suffering, and how essential it had been to shock the 
stubborn old man who might otherwise really have been the cause of 
his own daughter's death. The luminaries parted, each one satisfied 
that his erudition and perspicacity had been demonstrated in front of 
all the others. 

After hastily providing them with the attestation, Kirsanov went in to 
tell the patient about his success. At his first words she seized hold of 
his hand; he barely managed to withdraw it in time to prevent her 
from kissing it. “But I won't allow your father to come in and tell you 
the same thing for quite some time,” he said. “First he must hear my 
lecture about how he’s to conduct himself.” He explained what advice 
he'd give her father and assured her that he wouldn't let the old man 
go until it had all been firmly implanted. 

Shaken by the impact of the consultation, the old man was severely 
chastened. He now regarded Kirsanov in a very different light than he 
had the day before—a little the way Marya Aleksevna had regarded 
Lopukhov differently after he appeared in her dream as a tax farmer.2°° 
Yesterday Polozov quite naturally thought, “I’m older than you and 
more experienced. There’s no one on earth cleverer than I. Besides, 
why should I listen to you, you penniless milksop; I was smart enough 
to earn two million rubles [in fact it had been only two and not four]! 
Match that and then we can talk.” Now, however, Polozov thought, 


280. See above, pp. 166-67. 


What Is to Be Done? 401 


“What a bear he is! He got his own way. He knows what he’s doing.” 
The more he talked with Kirsanov, the more vividly he imagined him 
in a form other than that of a bear, namely, an old forgotten recollec- 
tion from his own life as a hussar. His riding master, Zakharchenko, 
was sitting astride Gromoboi (Zhukovsky's ballads were still fashion- 
able then among the ladies, and partly, as aresult, among the cavaliers 
too, both military and civilian).281 Gromoboi was being put through his 
paces smartly by Zakharchenko, but the horse’s lips were cut and 
dripping with blood. Polozov was somewhat horrified to hear Kir- 
sanov’s answer to his first question, “Would you really have admin- 
istered a fatal dose?’ 

“Absolutely! Of course,” Kirsanov replied with complete composure. 
“Naturally.” 

“What a scoundrel!” Polozov thought. “He sounds like a cook about 
to wring a chicken’s neck.” 

“Would you have had the courage?” 

“In this case? Of course. Did you take me for a milksop?” 

“Youre a frightening man,” repeated Polozov. 

“That means you've yet to meet any really frightening men,” replied 
Kirsanov with a condescending smile, thinking to himself, “You ought 
to meet Rakhmetov.” 

“But how did you manipulate all those doctors?” 

“As if that were hard!” answered Kirsanov with a slight grimace. 

Polozov again remembered Zakharchenko, who had observed to 
Staff Captain Volynov, “Why did you bring me this lop-eared nag to 
ride, Your Excellency? I’m ashamed to mount him!” 

After putting a stop to Polozov's interminable and repetitive ques- 
tions, Kirsanov began to instruct him as to how he should behave. 

“Remember that a person can use his reason only when he’s not 
undisturbed and that he doesn’t get angry only so long as others don’t 
irritate him. Remember too that his fantasies lose their value only 
when others don’t deprive him of them, but allow him to examine 
them himself to see whether theyre good or bad. If Solovtsov is as bad 
as you say (and as I certainly believe him to be), your daughter will see 
that for herself. But that will happen only if you don't interfere or 
arouse in her the idea that youre somehow scheming against him and 
trying to thwart them. One word from you against him could set the 
whole thing back two weeks; several words could destroy it forever. 
You must remain entirely aloof.” The instructions were seasoned with 


281. Gromoboi (“Battle Thunder") was the hero of a ballad of the same name (1810) by 
the noted pre-Romantic Russian poet Vassily Zhukovsky (1783-1852). Zhukovsky, son of 
a rich noble landowner and a Turkish captive, was best known for his literary ballads 
and his translations of European poetry into Russian. 


402 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


the following arguments: “Is it easy to force you to do something if you 
don’t want to do it? No, but I forced you. That means I know what I’m 
doing. Therefore, you should believe what I say about what you must 
do. I know what I'm talking about; you must do the listening.” Toward 
people such as Polozov was at that time, there’s no other way to act 
except forcefully, grabbing them by the throat. At last Polozov yielded, 
promising to behave himself as instructed. But even after he was con- 
vinced that Kirsanov was right and that he must do as he was told, 
Polozov still couldn't figure out what sort of man Kirsanov was. He 
seemed to be on his side, but he was also on hers. He was forcing him 
to submit to his daughter’s wishes, yet he wanted her to change her 
own mind. How could all this be reconciled? 

“Very simply. I want you to allow her to be reasonable, that’s all.” 

Polozov wrote a note to Solovtsov asking him to be good enough to 
come see him about a very important matter. Solovtsov appeared that 
very evening. He came to a cordial but very dignified understanding 
with the old man. He was accepted as his daughter's intended on 
condition that the marriage not take place before three months had 
passed. 


vii. 


Kirsanov couldn't abandon the case now. He had to help Katerina 
Vasilievna recover from her blindness; even more, he had to keep his 
eye on her father and support him in his resolve to adhere to the 
agreed method of noninterference. But he considered it was awkward 
to visit the Polozovs during the first few days after the crisis. Katerina 
Vasilievna, of course, was still in an exalted state; if he were to see (as 
he certainly expected) that her intended was worthless indeed, then 
even his own silent disapproval of him, not only a direct statement, 
would be very detrimental and would prolong her exaltation. About a 
week and a half later Kirsanov dropped by, but in the morning, so as 
not to meet the suitor directly, but to secure Katerina Vasilievna’s 
permission to do so. She was feeling much better already, though still 
very pale and thin. She was completely healthy now, even though her 
former famous physician was busy prescribing remedies for her once 
again. When Kirsanov had returned her to his care, he'd said, “Let him 
treat you. None of his medicines can do you anyharm now, even if you 
start taking them.” Katerina Vasilievna greeted Kirsanov with rapture, 
but stared at him in amazement when he told her why he’d come. 

“You saved my life and yet you need my permission to visit us!” 

“But in his presence my visit here could seem like an attempt to 


What Is to Be Done? 403 


interfere in your affairs without your permission. You know my rule: 
do nothing to help a person against his own will.” 

Kirsanov came on the second or third evening and found Katya’s 
intended to be just as Polozov had described him. He also found 
Polozov behaving in a satisfactory manner; the well-trained old man 
wasn't interfering with his daughter. Kirsanov spent the whole evening 
there, in no way revealing his opinion of Katya’s suitor. In saying good- 
bye to her, he gave no indication whether he liked the man or not. 

That was enough to arouse her curiosity and doubt. The next day 
she thought, “Kirsanov didn’t say a word about him. If he’d made a 
good impression on Kirsanov, then he'd have told me. Could it be that 
Kirsanov didn’t like him? What could he not have liked about him?” 
When her beloved arrived that evening, she examined his behavior and 
reflected on his conversation. She said to herself that she was doing it 
to prove that Kirsanov should not and could not find any flaws in him. 
That was really true. But the need to prove to oneself that there are no 
flaws in one’s beloved soon leads to the discovery of flaws. 

Kirsanov returned a few days later. Once again he said not a word to 
her about whether he liked her suitor or not. This time she couldn't 
restrain herself. At the end of the evening she asked, “Your opinion? 
Why don’t you say something?” 

“T.don’t know if you'll be pleased by my opinion and whether you'll 
consider it impartial.” 

“Don't you like him?” 

Kirsanov was silent. 

“Don't you like him?” 

“I didn’t say that.” 

“It’s clear. Why don’t you like him?” 

“T'll wait until that’s also clear to you.” 

The following evening Katerina Vasilievna scrutinized Solovtsov 
even more carefully. “He's fine. Kirsanov is being unfair. Why can't I see 
what Kirsanov doesn't like about him?” She was annoyed at her own 
poor powers of observation. She thought, “Can i really be so dense?” 
Her pride was stung in a way that would prove very dangerous to her 
beloved. 

When Kirsanov appeared a few days later, he perceived the oppor- 
tunity of acting more forcefully. Up to this point he’d avoided all con- 
versation with Solovtsov so as not to alarm Katerina Vasilievna by any 
premature interference. Now he joined the group around her and 
Solovtsov and began to steer the conversation in a direction that 
would reveal Solovtsov's true character; then he drew him into conver- 
sation. The subject was wealth; it seemed to Katerina Vasilievna that 
Solovtsov was too preoccupied with thoughts about wealth. The con- 


404 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


versation turned to women; it seemed to Katya that Solovtsov talked 
about them too frivolously. Then the subject switched to family life; in 
vain Katya tried to dispel the impression that a wife might find it 
lonely and difficult to live with such a husband. 

The crisis had arrived. Katerina Vasilievna lay awake for a long time; 
she wept, annoyed at herself for entertaining such an offensive view of 
Solovtsov. “No, he’s not a cold man. He doesn’t despise women. He 
loves me, not my fortune.” If these objections had been made in reply 
to anyone else, they would have remained stubbornly embedded in 
her mind. But she was making them to herself. You can’t resist for very 
long a truth you discover for yourself. That truth is yours, your very 
own. There's no possibility of suspecting any treachery there. 

The next evening Katerina Vasilievna tested Solovtsov herself, just as 
Kirsanov had done the day before. She told herself that she merely 
wanted to be convinced that she’d insulted him for no good reason, 
but she herself felt that she’d begun to distrust him. That night once 
again she couldn't fall asleep, but this time she was annoyed at him. 
Why did he hold forth in a way that didn’t allay her doubts, but only 
reinforced them? She was also annoyed at herself, but in this feeling a 
new theme had clearly emerged: “How could I have been so blind?” 

It’s easy to see why within a day or two she became entirely preoc- 
cupied by the thought “Soon I'll lose any chance to correct my mis- 
take, if I’m mistaken about him.” 

The next time Kirsanov arrived, he saw that he could have a word 
with her. “You asked earlier about my opinion of your intended,” he 
said. “That’s not nearly as important as your opinion. What do you 
think of him?” 

Now it was she who was silent. 

“I dare not continue the inquiry,” he said. He began talking about 
something else and soon moved away. 

But in half an hour she approached him. 

“Give me your advice. You see that my mind is vacillating.” 

“Why do you need someone else’s advice, when you know what you 
must do if it’s vacillating?” 

“Wait until it stops vacillating?” 

“Just as you think best.” 

“Tl postpone the wedding.” 

“Why not, if that’s what you think best.” 

“How will he take it?” 

“When you see how he takes it, you can consider once again what 
would be best.” 

“Tll find it hard to tell him.” 


What Is to Be Done? 405 


“If that’s the case, ask your father to tell him.” 

“I don’t want to hide behind anyone else. I'll tell him myself.” 

“If you feel strong enough to do so, then of course that would be 
much better.” 

Naturally, with other people, Vera Pavlovna for example, it wouldn't 
have been necessary to proceed quite so slowly. But each tempera- 
ment has its own particular requirements. While an ardent person is 
irritated by methodical deliberation, a gentle one is perturbed by 
abrupt measures. 

The success of Katerina Vasilievna’s explanation with her intended 
surpassed even Kirsanov's expectations. He thought that Solovtsov 
would manage to keep his wits and drag out the affair by his own 
submissiveness and meek entreaties. But no, in spite of all his self- 
control, Solovtsov couldn't restrain himself. When he realized that an 
enormous fortune might be slipping through his fingers, he let go of 
those few slim chances remaining to him. He launched into a bitter 
tirade, accusing Polozov of scheming against him. He told Katerina 
Vasilievna that she allowed her father to exercise too much power over 
her, that she was afraid of him, and that she was merely following his 
orders. Meanwhile, Polozov didn’t even know about his daughter's 
decision to postpone the wedding. Katya felt that he was allowing her 
complete freedom. The reproaches heaped on her father offended 
Katya by their unfairness and insulted her by revealing Solovtsov's 
view of her as a creature lacking both will and character. 

“It seems that you view me as a plaything in the hands of other 
people?” 

“Yes,” he replied in irritation. 

“I was prepared to die without a thought for my father. But you 
didn't understand that! From this moment on,” she said, “everything is 
over between us,” and she quickly left the room. 


Vili. 


Afterward Katerina Vasilievna was depressed for quite some time, 
but although this episode intensified her grief, it wasn’t the cause of it. 
There are some natures that manifest very little interest in particular 
facts; these facts serve merely to stimulate general ideas that have a 
much greater impact on such people. If they possess remarkably 
strong intellects, they become reshapers of general ideas—in olden 
times they used to become great philosophers. Kant, Fichte, and Hegel 
never developed a single specific problem—that would have been too 


406 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


boring.28* Of course, this applies only to men. Women, it's thought 
nowadays, don't ever have strong intellects. You see, nature has de- 
nied them that, just as it’s denied the blacksmith a tender complexion, 
the tailor a good posture, and the cobbler a fine sense of smell. All of 
that is nature’s doing. That explains why there are no great minds 
among women. People with inferior intelligence and such a turn of 
character are usually phlegmatic to the point of insensitivity. People of 
ordinary intelligence are inclined to pensiveness, to a quiet life, and to 
dreaming in general. But this still doesn't mean that they're vision- 
aries. Many of them have a very weak imagination and are very positive 
people—they simply prefer quiet reverie. 

Katerina Vasilievna fell in love with Solovtsov because of his letters; 
she was dying of a love based solely on her dreams. From this it’s 
perfectly clear that she was very romantically inclined at the time. The 
boisterous life of the vulgar society that filled Polozov's house was in 
no way conducive to exalted idealism. In other words, this characteris- 
tic arose from her own nature. All that boisterousness had oppressed 
her for some time; she preferred to read and dream. Now she began to 
be oppressed by wealth itself, not only the clamor surrounding it. But 
there’s no need to consider her an unusual person on that account; 
it’s a familiar feeling to all wealthy women of modest and gentle char- 
acter. In her it merely developed sooner than usual because she re- 
ceived a powerful lesson very early on. 

“Whom can I trust? What can I believe in?” she asked herself after 
the events with Solovtsov. She realized the answer: no one and noth- 
ing. Her father’s wealth attracted avarice, cunning, and deceit from all 
over town. She was surrounded by mercenaries, liars, and flatterers. 
Every word said to her was calculated on the basis of her father’s 
millions. 


282. All major figures in the development of German idealist philosophy. Synthesizing 
rationalism and skepticism, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) argued that only objects of 
experience could be known, whereas things lying beyond experience were unknowable. 
He therefore concluded that scientific analysis could not prove the existence of such 
concepts as freedom and immortality, but nonetheless asserted that morality required 
belief in their existence. A strong exponent of liberalism and German nationalism, Jo- 
hann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814) postulated an absolute or ultimate cause in the uni- 
verse from which all things, including human consciousness, derive. According to 
Fichte, the creative activity of this absolute emerges in individual consciousness through 
the ego and thereby influences human action. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770— 
1831) devised an extremely complex philosophical system that strongly influenced Rus- 
sian intellectuals in the 1840s as well as Western thinkers, including Marx, Kierkegaard, 
and Sartre. Hegel posited an enveloping absolute spirit that guides all reality, including 
human reason. This absolute spirit develops and is known through a dialectical process 
of change whereby one concept or phenomenon (the thesis) inevitably generates and 
interacts with its opposite (the antithesis) to produce a new concept (the synthesis), 
which in turn becomes the thesis for a new triad. 


What Is to Be Done? 407 


Her thoughts turned more and more serious. She became interested 
in general questions about the wealth that bothered her so much and 
about the poverty that tormented others. Her father provided her with 
a rather large amount of spending money; like any good woman, she 
used some of it to help the poor. But as she read and reflected, she 
began to notice that her kind of help produced considerably fewer 
results than expected. She realized that she was being taken in much 
too easily by the feigned poverty of the undeserving poor. She saw that 
the people who did deserve help, those who'd know how to put the 
money to good use, almost never received any lasting good from it. 
They'd be temporarily lifted out of their poverty, but in six months to a 
year these people would be back where they'd started. She began to 
think: Why does wealth exist when it ruins people? Why does poverty 
persist among the poor? Why did she see so many poor people who 
were just as unreasonable and wicked as the rich? 

She was a dreamer, but her dreams were gentle, like her character; 
they contained as little brilliance as she did herself. Her favorite writer 
was George Sand, but she imagined herself not as Lelia, Indiana, Caval- 
canti, or even Consuelo; in her dreams she was either Jeanne or more 
often Geneviéve.283 Geneviéve was her favorite heroine. She strolls 
through the meadow picking flowers to serve as models for her handi- 
work; and now she encounters André there. What sweet meetings! 
They realize they love each other. This was Katya’s dream, and she 
knew it was only a dream. But she also loved to ponder the enviable 
fate of Miss Nightingale, that gentle, humble girl about whom no one 
knew very much—there was nothing to know except that she was 
beloved by all of England.284 Was she young? Rich or poor? Happy or 
unhappy? No one talked about that; no one thought about that. Every- 
one simply praised this girl who was the Angel of Mercy in English 
hospitals in the Crimea and Scutari,285 and who, at the end of the war, 
returned to her homeland with hundreds of men whom she’d saved 
and continued to take care of the infirm. . . . These were her dreams; 
Katerina Vasilievna wished to see them fulfilled. Her fantasy carried 
her no further than these thoughts about Geneviéve and Miss Night-

(1833), Indiana from Indiana (1831), Quintilia Cavalcanti from Le Secrétaire intime (1834), 
Consuelo from Consuelo (1842), Jeanne from Jeanne (1844), and Genevieve from André 
(1834).

helped to found modern nursing. She opened the profession to women through her 
organization of a female nursing unit during the Crimean War (1854-1856) and her 
establishment of a nursing school at St. Thomas's Hospital in London in 1860.

ingale. Can one say that she possessed a genuine fantasy? Can she 
really be called a dreamer? 

Genevieve in the noisy, vulgar society of scoundrels and mediocre 
fops. .. . Miss Nightingale amidst idle luxury. . . . How could she fail to 
be bored and depressed? Therefore, Katerina Vasilievna was almost 
more glad than sad when her father lost his fortune. She was sorry to 
see him change from a vigorous person to an old man, and sorry that 
her ability to help others was significantly reduced. At first she was 
offended by the disdain of the crowd that once had fawned upon her 
and cringed before her and her father. But she was also glad that the 
vulgar, tedious rabble had abandoned them; they no longer would 
restrain her life or irritate her with their treachery and baseness. Now 
she felt so free. There even seemed to be some hope of happiness. “If I 
discover love now, it will be for me alone and not for my father’s 
millions.”

Polozov wanted to arrange the sale of the stearine factory in which 
he was both a shareholder and the manager. After about half a year or 
so of intensive search, he finally located a buyer. On the buyer's calling 
card was engraved the name Charles Beaumont; it was pronounced 
not in the French style, as the uninitiated might suppose, but in the 
English manner. That was only natural, because the buyer was an 
agent of the London firm of Hodgson, Loter & Co., for the purchase of 
tallow and stearine. The factory could not go on in the poor financial 
and administrative condition that prevailed under its present share- 
holders. But in the hands of a competent firm it would yield high 
returns. A firm that spent some 500,000 or 600,000 to buy it could 
count on an annual income of about 100,000 rubles. This agent was a 
conscientious fellow. He examined the factory carefully and scrutin- 
ized the books before advising his firm to go through with the pur- 
chase. Then negotiations over the sale of the factory began with a 
group of shareholders; they dragged on for a very long time, owing to 
the nature of our shareholding societies—it was enough to drive to 
distraction even those patient Greeks who hadn't found it too tedious 
to besiege Troy for ten years on end.28® Meanwhile Polozov courted 
the agent, in accordance with the age-old manner of treating impor-

tant people, and repeatedly invited him to dinner. The agent kept his 
distance from the old man and declined his invitations. But once, after 
avery lengthy negotiating session with the directors of the group, tired 
and hungry, he accepted an invitation to dine with Polozov, who lived 
right there on the same staircase.2®7

Charles Beaumont, just like any other Charles, John, James, or 
William, wasn’t fond of dwelling on personal intimacies and effusions. 
But when asked, he related his own story in a few well-chosen words. 
His family, he said, was of Canadian origin; indeed, in Canada almost 
half the population consists of descendants of French colonists. His 
family was one of those; hence the French surname. And his features 
resembled those of a Frenchman more than an Englishman or a 
Yankee. But, he continued, his grandfather moved from the vicinity of 
Quebec to New York; such things happen. His father was still a child at 
the time. Later, of course, he grew up and became an adult. Meanwhile 
a certain wealthy gentleman with progressive ideas about agriculture 
took it into his head to establish cotton plantations instead of vine- 
yards on the southern shores of the Crimea. He dispatched someone 
to find him a manager from North America. They located James Beau- 
mont, native of Canada, resident of New York—that is, aman who'd no 
more seen a cotton plantation than you or I have seen Mount Ararat 
from our native Petersburg or Kursk.285 That’s always the way it hap- 
pens with progressive people. The truth is that the experiment was in 
no way spoiled by the American manager's complete inexperience 
with cotton plantations, since planting cotton in the Crimea is just 
about the same as trying to grow grapes in Petersburg. When this 
became clear, the American manager was discharged from the cotton 
plantation; he wound up as a distiller at a factory in the Tambov 
region,289 where he lived for almost the rest of his life. His son Charles 
was born there; shortly afterward he buried his wife there. At the age of

staircase so that the people living on a lower floor never had to commingle with those 
people—usually of a lower social class—who lived above them. Chernyshevsky is indi- 
cating that Polozov and Beaumont occupied similarsocial as well as living space, proba- 
bly on the second, “bourgeois” floor. 

288. Mount Ararat, according to legend the place where Noah's ark landed, lies in 
eastern Turkey. Kursk, the chief city of Kursk province, a predominantly agricultural 
region, is about 300 miles south of Moscow.

sixty-five, having put aside some money for his declining years, he 
decided to return to America. Charles was then about twenty years 
old. When his father died, Charles wanted to return to Russia because, 
having been born there and having lived until the age of twenty in the 
Tambov region, he felt himself to be a Russian. He and his father had 
lived in New York, where he worked as a clerk in a commercial office. 
After his father died he moved over to the New York office of the 
London firm Hodgson, Loter & Co., knowing that it did business with 
Petersburg. After he'd established himself, he expressed a desire to 
obtain a position in Russia, explaining that he knew the country as if it 
were his homeland. Naturally it would be an advantage for the firm to 
have such an employee in Russia. He was transferred to the London 
office for a trial. He was successful, and about six months before the 
dinner with Polozov he'd arrived in Petersburg as an agent for the 
purchase of tallow and stearine at a salary of £500. In perfect accord 
with this story, Beaumont, who was born and lived until the age of 
twenty in the Tambov region, and, since his father was the only Ameri- 
can or Englishman within a radius of twenty, fifty, or a hundred versts 
(and spent all his days at the factory), also in accord with this story, 
Charles Beaumout spoke Russian like a native. He also spoke English 
fairly well, though not altogether fluently, as one would expect of a 
grown man who'd lived for only afew years in a country where English 
is spoken.

Beaumont found himself sitting at dinner with the old man and his 
daughter, a very nice, somewhat pensive blonde. 

“Who would have thought,” said Polozov during dinner, “that these 
shares in the factory would ever have meant so much to me? It’s 
difficult for a man of my age to suffer such a blow. It’s a good thing that 
Katya cared so little about the loss of her fortune; even during my 
lifetime it was really more hers than mine. Her mother had some 
capital; I had very little. Of course, I managed to turn every ruble into 
twenty, which goes to show, on the other hand, that the fortune re- 
sulted more from my hard work than from any inheritance. And I did 
work very hard. It also took considerable know-how!” The old man 
went on at length in this self-congratulatory vein. ‘It was earned by my 
sweat and blood, but mainly because of my intelligence,” he con- 
cluded. Then he repeated what he'd said before, that it was hard to 
endure such a blow, and that if Katya had been distressed about it, he 
would have lost his mind. But not only did Katya keep from fretting, 
she even supported her father. 


What Is to Be Done? 411 


Either in accordance with the American custom of seeing nothing 
unusual about rapid fortune or sudden ruin, or else in accordance 
with his own individual character, Beaumont had no desire to go into 
raptures over the greatness of a mind that could earn three or four 
million, or to lament the kind of great loss that left one with enough 
money to keep a decent chef. Nevertheless, he had to register some 
sign of sympathy after such a long speech. He said, “Yes, it’s a great 
relief when one’s family bears up together under adversity.” 

“But you seem to doubt it, Karl Yakovlich.29° Do you think that Katya 
is so pensive now because she’s pining for her lost fortune? No, Karl 
Yakovlich. No, indeed. You're wrong to be so unfair. She and I share a 
different grief. We've lost our faith in people,” said Polozov in a half- 
joking, half-serious tone, the sort used by experienced old men when 
talking about the splendid but naive ideas of children. 

Katerina Vasilievna blushed. She found it disagreeable to have her 
father turn the conversation to a discussion of her personal feelings. 
But, in addition to paternal love, there was another well-known cir- 
cumstance for which her father was not to blame. If there’s nothing to 
talk about and there's a cat or a dog in the room, the conversation 
turns to it; if there's neither a cat nor a dog, then it’s children. The 
weather is a clear third choice and represents an extreme lack of 
resourcefulness. 

“No, papa, you're wrong in attributing my pensiveness to such a 
sublime motive. You know that I have a melancholy nature; besides, 
I'm bored.” 

“To be melancholy is a matter of choice,” said Beaumont. “But to be 
bored, in my opinion, is inexcusable. Boredom is in fashion among our 
English brethren; but we Americans know nothing about it. We don’t 
have time to be bored; we have too much to do. I guess, that is, it 
seems to me” (he corrected his Americanism)?! “that Russians should 
see themselves in that same position. In my opinion they too have too 
much to do. But in fact, I observe the exact opposite in Russians: 
they're very given to spleen.292 Even the English can’t be compared 
with them in this respect. English society is renowned throughout 
Europe, including Russia, as the most tiresome in the world; yet if it's

292. The Russian verb here is khandrit’, from the noun khandra. It derives from the 
Greek (hypo)chondria and is usually rendered in English as “spleen” and in French as 
ennui. By ascribing the ineffectualness of the earlier generation of the idealist intel- 
ligentsia—the “superfluous men” of the 1840s—to this infamous nineteenth-century 
European malady rather than to their constraining environment, Chernyshevsky em- 
phasizes the activism of his own generation of “new people.”

less sociable, lively, and cheerful than the French, it’s that much more 
so than the Russian. Even your own travelers tell tales of the tiresome- 
ness of English society. I don’t understand where their eyes are when 
they're at home.” 

“Russians are right to be melancholy,” said Katerina Vasilievna. 
“What work do they have? There’s nothing for them to do here. They 
have to sit by with their arms folded. Show me what work there is to be 
done, and in all probability I'll no longer be bored.” 

“You'd like to find some work to do? That shouldn't pose any prob- 
lem at all. You see such ignorance all around you. Forgive me for 
talking about your country like this, that is, about your homeland” (he 
corrected his Anglicism).293 “But I was born here and grew up here 
myself and consider it my own, so I won't stand on ceremony. Here 
you have both Turkish ignorance and Japanese helplessness.2% I de- 
spise your homeland because | love it as my own, I say in paraphrase 
of your poet.295 There’s a great deal of work to be done.” 

“Yes. But all alone—and a woman at that. .. . What can I do?” 

“But you're already doing something, Katya,” said Polozov. “I'll tell 
you her secret, Kar] Yakovlich. Because she’s so bored, she teaches 
little girls. Her pupils come every day and she spends from ten to one 
o’clock working with them, sometimes even longer.” 

Beaumont looked at Katerina Vasilievna respectfully. “Now that's 
our way, the American way. Of course, by American I mean only the 
Northern or free states. The Southern states are even worse than Mex- 
ico, and almost as despicable as Brazil.” (Beaumont was a rabid aboli- 
tionist.) “Yes, that’s our way! So then, why are you bored?” 

“Do you consider this serious work, Mr. Beaumont? I think it’s no 
more than recreation. Perhaps I’m mistaken. You may choose to call 
me a materialist. . . .” 

“Do you expect to hear that reproach from a man who comes from a 
country that everyone says has only one goal and one aim, namely, the 
dollar?” 


293. See n. 291 above. Though normally translated as strana, in this context the 
English word “country” corresponds most closely to the Russian rodina (homeland, 
native land, or motherland). 

294. By comparing the idealist intellectuals of the previous generation with the al- 
legedly tradition-bound and mentally somnolent people of the East, Chernyshevsky 
assigns blame to them rather than to their environment for their ineffectualness. The 
recent Soviet translation of the novel (see the bibliography) tries unsuccessfully to tone 
down Chernyshevsky’s racist and nationalistic remark by rendering this passage as 
“Asiatic ignorance and helplessness” (p. 442).

novelist Mikhail Lermontov (1814-1841), or, more likely, an allusion to one of several 
lyrics by Nekrasov (see n. 106 above): “Motherland” (1846), “Blissful is the gentle poet” 
(1852), “Be silent, muse of vengeance and grief” (1855), or “Poet and Citizen” (1855-1856). 


What Is to Be Done? 413 


“You're joking, but I’m really afraid to speak my mind to you. My 
ideas may sound like the ones preached by the obscurantists about 
the uselessness of enlightenment.” 

“So!” thought Beaumont. “Has she really come to that? This is be- 
coming interesting.” 

“I’m an obscurantist myself,” he said. “I stand with the illiterate 
blacks against their civilized owners in the Southern states. Excuse 
me, I was distracted bymyAmerican hatred. I find it very interesting to 
hear your opinion.” 

“It’s very prosaic, Mr. Beaumont, but life has led me to it. I think the 
work I do is too one-sided, and that side isn’t the one that most 
deserves the attention of those who want to serve the people. Here's 
what I think: give people bread and they'll learn how to read by them- 
selves.296 One must start with bread or it’s a waste of time.” 

“So why not begin where you ought to begin?” asked Beaumont, 
now somewhat animated. “It’s possible. I know examples, back in 
America,” he added. 

“I told you—what can I do alone? I don't know how to begin. Even if 
I did, what chance would I have? A girl's bound on all sides. I'm 
independent only in my own room. What can I do there? Put a book 
on the table and teach people how to read. Where can I go alone? 
Whom can I see alone? What work can I do alone?” 

“T think you're making me look like a despot, Katya,” said her father. 
“Since you taught me that lesson, I’m no longer guilty of that.” 

“Papa, I blush to think of that. I was only a child then. No, papa, 
you're very good and don’t hold me back. It’s society. Is it true, Mr. 
Beaumont, that in America girls aren’t so hampered?” 

“Yes, we can be proud of that. Of course, even there it’s not every- 
thing it should be. Still, there's no comparison between us and the 
Europeans. Everything you've heard about women’s emancipation in 
America is true.” 

“Papa, let's go to America after Mr. Beaumont buys your factory,” 
said Katerina Vasilievna in jest. “There I'll do something. How happy 
I'd be!” 

“One can find work in Petersburg, too,” said Beaumont. 

“Tell me where.” 

Beaumont hesitated for several seconds. “Why did I come back 
here?” he wondered. “And how could I find out better than through 
her?” he thought to himself. 

“You haven't heard?” he said aloud. “There’s an experiment at put-

self-education and expresses his belief that it was the impoverished materia] conditions

ting into practice those principles recently developed by economic 
science. Do you know about them?” 

“Yes, I've read something. That must be very interesting and valu- 
able. Can I really take part in it? Where can I find it?” 

“It was established by Madame Kirsanova.” 

“Who's she? Is her husband a doctor?” 

“Do you know him? Didn't he tell you about it?” 

“It was quite a while ago and he wasn't married then. I was very ill. 
He came several times and managed to save me. Oh, what a man! Is 
she like him?” 

How could she make Madame Kirsanova’s acquaintance? Would 
Beaumont introduce Katerina Vasilievna to her? No, the Kirsanovs had 
never even heard of him. But she didn’t need any introduction. Surely 
Kirsanova would be very glad to find a sympathetic soul. She could 
find out the address at the hospital where Kirsanov was employed. 


xii. 


That’s how Polozova got acquainted with Vera Pavlovna. She went 
off to see her the very next morning. Beaumont was so interested that 
he came that evening to find out what Katerina Vasilievna thought of 
her new acquaintance and the new enterprise. 

Katerina Vasilievna was very animated. There was no trace whatever 
of her sadness; her pensiveness had given way to rapture. She enthusi- 
astically told Beaumont what she’d seen that morning, even though 
she'd just told her father the very same thing. Clearly one telling 
hadn't exhausted her; there seemed to be no end of things to tell. Yes, 
now her heart was full. She’d found her life’s work. Beaumont listened 
carefully, but is it permissible to listen in such a fashion? And she 
cried almost angrily: 

“Mr. Beaumont, I’m very disappointed in you. Does this all make so 
little impression on you that you're merely interested in what I say, 
but no more?” 

“Katerina Vasilievna, you forget that I've seen this all before in Amer- 
ica. I find several details particularly interesting, but the enterprise 
itself sounds all too familiar. Only the people who've organized it so 
successfully interest me, as a novelty; whereas for you the whole enter- 
prise is novel. For example, what can you tell me about Madame 
Kirsanova?” 

“Oh, my God! I liked her very much, of course. She explained it all to 
me so lovingly.” 

“So you said.” 


What Is to Be Done? 415 


“What else is there? What more can I tell you? Do you think I could 
pay attention to her with such an enterprise right before my eyes?” 

“Indeed,” said Beaumont, “I understand that one forgets all about 
people when one’s interested in their work. Still, is there anything 
more you can tell me about Madame Kirsanova?” 

Katerina Vasilievna began to gather her recollections of Vera Pavlov- 
na, but all she came up with was the first impression that Vera Pavlov- 
na had made on her. She described her appearance vividly, her man- 
ner of speaking, and everything else that leaped to the eye at the 
moment of meeting someone new. But further, there was really noth- 
ing more she could add about Vera Pavlovna. The workshop, the work- 
shop, the workshop—and Vera Pavlovna’'s explanations of the work- 
shop. She’d understood all these explanations, but she remembered 
very little about Vera Pavlovna after the first words of their initial en- 
counter. 

“And so if I hope to learn something more from you about Madame 
Kirsanova, this time I'm to be disappointed. But I won't give up. In a 
few days I'll ask you about her again.” 

“Why don’t you get to know her yourself if she interests you so 
much?” 

“T'd like to. Perhaps I will at some point. But first I must learn more 
about her.” Beaumont paused for a moment. “I wonder whether to ask 
you or not....I think it best to ask. If my name should happen to 
come up in conversation with her, please don't say that I asked about 
her or that I want to meet her.” 

“This is beginning to sound mysterious, Mr. Beaumont,” said Ka- 
terina Vasilievna in a serious tone of voice. “You want to learn about 
them through me, but wish to conceal yourself.” 

“Yes, Katerina Vasilievna. How can I explain it? I’m afraid to meet 
them.” 

“This is all most peculiar, Mr. Beaumont.” 

“That's true. I'll speak more frankly: I'm afraid this might be unpleas- 
ant for them. They've never heard my name. But it’s possible that I may 
have had conflicts with certain people who are close to them, or even 
with them. No matter. . . . In a word, I must first make certain whether 
they would enjoy meeting me.” 

“This is all most peculiar, Mr. Beaumont.” 

“I’m an honest man, Katerina Vasilievna. I want to assure you that I 
have no desire to compromise you. You and I are meeting only for the 
second time, but I already have a deep respect for you.” 

“I can also see, Mr. Beaumont, that you're an honorable man, but 


“If that’s how you think of me, then you'll let me visit you again so 


416 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


that when you have enough confidence in me, I can ask you more 
about the Kirsanovs. Or, better still, you bring up the subject when you 
feel you can fulfill this request I make now and I won't mention it 
again. Will you allow me to visit you?” 

“If you please, Mr. Beaumont,” said Katerina Vasilievna with a slight 
shrug of her shoulders. “But you'll agree that .. .” 

Once again she didn’t want to finish what she'd started to say. 

“That I must be arousing your suspicions right now? True. But I'll 
wait until that passes.” 


xiii. 


Beaumont began to visit the Polozovs very frequently. “Why not?” 
thought the old man. “He’s a good match. Of course, Katya could have 
had a much better suitor before. But even then she was neither schem- 
ing nor ambitious. And now one couldn't hope for more.” 

Indeed, Beaumont was a very good match. He said that he was 
thinking of staying in Russia for good because he considered it his 
homeland. He was a man of character: although he’d begun with 
nothing, by the age of thirty he'd achieved a respectable position. If 
he’d been a Russian, Polozov would have preferred that he belong to 
the gentry, but that didn’t apply to foreigners, especially not to the 
French, and even less to the Americans. In America a man can be a 
cobbler’s apprentice or a tiller of the soil one day, a general the next, 
president the day after, and then an office worker or a lawyer the day 
after that. Americans are a peculiar breed, the only thing they ask is 
how much money a man has and how smart he is. “That's the way it 
ought to be,” Polozov continued his thought. “That's the kind of man I 
am. I took up trade and married a merchant’s daughter. Money is the 
main thing, followed by intelligence, because without that you can’t 
earn any money. He'll make money: he’s started down that path. He'll 
buy the factory and become its manager. Then the firm will make him 
a partner. And their firms are different from ours. Soon he'll be rolling 
in millions... .” 

It’s quite possible that Polozov’s dreams about his future son-in- 
law's becoming a millionaire through commercial transactions 
weren't fated to come true, any more than Marya Aleksevna’s dream 
about her first son-in-law’s career in tax farming. But even so, Beau- 
mont was still a good match for Katerina Vasilievna. 

However, could Polozov have been mistaken in envisioning Beau- 
mont as his future son-in-law? If the old man still had any doubts in 
this regard, they disappeared when, about two weeks after he’d begun 


What Is to Be Done? 417 


his visits, Beaumont told Polozov that the sale of the factory might be 
postponed for several days. But there shouldn't be any delay. Even if 
they weren't waiting for Mr. Loter, it would probably take them at least 
a week to draw up the final papers, and Mr. Loter would be arriving in 
Petersburg in about four days. 

“Before I knew you personally,” said Beaumont, “I wanted to close 
this deal myself. Now it would be rather awkward, since we know each 
other so well. So that no misunderstandings will arise later, I've writ- 
ten home to my firm and reported that during our negotiations I made 
friends with the manager, and that almost all of his capital is invested 
in shares. I requested that the firm send someone to close the deal 
instead of me. As you can see, Mr. Loter is on his way.” 

Careful and clever. And at the same time, it clearly demonstrated 
Beaumont’s intention to marry Katya. A simple aquaintance would not 
have warranted such caution. 


xiv. 


Beaumont was received rather coolly by Katerina Vasilievna on his 
next two or three visits. She really had begun to distrust this compara- 
tive stranger who'd expressed such a mysterious desire to find out all 
about a family with which (in his words) he wasn’t even acquainted. 
Yet he said that he was afraid to meet them because he wasn’t sure 
they’d appreciate it. But even during those early visits, if Katerina 
Vasilievna greeted him with uncertainty, she nevertheless soon be- 
came involved in lively conversation with him. In her earlier life, up to 
her acquaintance with Beaumont and Kirsanov, she’d never encoun- 
tered anyone like them. Beaumont felt such sympathy with everything 
that interested her and he understood her so well. Even with her best 
friends—by the way, she had only one, Polina, who some time before 
had married a manufacturer and moved with him to Moscow—even 
with Polina she couldn't speak as freely as she did with him. 

And he? At first, of course, he came not to see her but to use her to 
find out about Madame Kirsanova. But from the very beginning of their 
aquaintance, from the minute they began talking about boredom and 
ways to avoid it, it was obvious that he both respected her and sym- 
pathized with her. At their second meeting he was attracted by her 
enthusiasm at finding herself an occupation. Now with each new 
meeting his liking for her was becoming more and more apparent. 
Very quickly a simple and warm bond was formed between them; a 
week later Katerina Vasilievna told him all about the Kirsanovs. She 
was sure that this man could harbor no dishonorable thoughts.

It’s also true that when she began to talk about the Kirsanovs, he 
stopped her. “Why so soon?” he asked. “You still don’t know me very 
well.” 

“No, quite well enough, Mr. Beaumont. I see that if you didn’t want 
to explain your peculiar desire to me, then you probably had no right 
to speak about it. There are a great many secrets in the world.” 

He replied, “You can see that I no longer have such impatience to 
find out what I wanted to know about them.”

Katerina Vasilievna’s animation continued without letup and soon 
became her constant, habitual state of mind—bold, lively, and radiant. 
And so far as she could tell, it was precisely this animation, more than 
anything else, that drew Beaumont closer to her. And he thought 
about her a great deal now—that was all too obvious. After hearing her 
account of the Kirsanovs two or three times, he remarked at the fourth 
telling: “Now I know all I need to know. Thank you.” 

“What is it that you know? I've told you only that they love each 
other very much and that they're totally happy in their relationship.” 

“That's all I needed to know. Besides, I knew it already.” 

Their conversation moved to another subject. 

Of course, the first thought that occurred to Katerina Vasilievna at 
his initia] question about Madame Kirsanova was that he was infatu- 
ated with Vera Pavlovna. But now it was all too clear that this wasn’t 
the case. As well as Katerina Vasilievna now knew him, she even 
thought him incapable of being infatuated. However, he could be in 
love. That was a fact. And if he is in love with anyone now, it must be 
me, thought Katerina Vasilievna. 


Xvi. 


But did they really love each other? Let’s start with her. There was 
one instance when she showed some solicitude for Beaumont, but 
how did that end? Not at all as one might have expected from its 
beginning. Beaumont had begun to visit the Polozovs every day with- 
out fail. Sometimes he stayed a long time, sometimes not, but he came 
every day. On this fact alone Polozov based his conviction that Beau- 
mont planned to propose to Katerina Vasilievna. There was no other 
basis for this belief. But then an evening passed and Beaumont didn’t 
come. 


What Is to Be Done? 419 


“Papa, do you know if there's something the matter with him?” 

“T haven’t heard. Probably it’s nothing. He’s busy, that’s all.” 

Another evening passed and Beaumont still didn’t come. On the 
third morning Katerina Vasilievna prepared to go out. 

“Where are you going, Katya?” 

“I've a few things to attend to, papa.” 

She went to see Beaumont. He was sitting in a dressing gown with 
wide sleeves and was reading. When the door opened, he raised his 
eyes from the book. 

“Is that you, Katerina Vasilievna? I’m very glad and most grateful to 
you,” he said in the same tone of voice he used to greet her father. No, 
in fact his tone was much, much warmer. 

“Is anything the matter, Mr. Beaumont? You haven't come to visit us 
in some time. You worry me; besides, I've missed you.” 

“Nothing special, Katerina Vasilievna. You see I’m in good health. 
Would you care for a cup of tea? You see I’m having some.” 

“Gladly. But why haven't you visited us in so long? 

“Pyotr, bring in another glass. You see I’m in good health, so it was a 
mere trifle. Here’s what happened. I was at the factory with Mr. Loter 
and was explaining something to him. Without paying any attention, I 
put my hand down on a gear; it turned and scratched my hand right 
through the sleeve. 1 haven't been able to put on my frock coat for the 
last few days.” 

“Show me, or I'll worry that it’s not just a scratch, but a larger 
wound.” 

“How could that be” (Pyotr entered with a glass for Katerina Vasiliev- 
na) “when I’m using my two hands? Pyotr, clean out this ashtray and 
fetch me my cigar case; it’s on the table in the study. There, you see, 
it’s nothing. An English plaster is all that’s needed.”297 

“Yes, but there’s still some redness and swelling.” 

“Yesterday it was worse than this and by tomorrow it will be fine.” 
(Pyotr emptied the ashes, brought the cigar case, and left.) “I didn't 
want to come before you as a wounded hero.” 

“You could have written me a note.” 

“I thought I'd be able to get my coat on the following day—three 
days ago, that is. Then I thought it would be yesterday; then yesterday, 
I thought today. I didn’t want to alarm you.” 

“Well, you've alarmed me even more. It wasn’t very nice of you, Mr. 
Beaumont. When will you finish work on the sale of the factory?” 

“Probably in a few days. You know, the delay doesn’t depend on Mr. 
Loter and me, but on the group of shareholders.”

“What were you reading just now?” 

“A new novel by Thackeray. To have such talent, yet to have written 
himself out! It’s all because his scope of ideas is so limited.”298 

“I’ve read it. You’re quite right,” and so on. 

They lamented over Thackeray’s decline and chatted for another 
half hour about other matters of that sort. 

“Well, it's time for me to see Vera Pavlovna. When would you like to 
meet them? They're such fine people.” 


“Someday soon. .. .I'llgettoit....I’llask you to arrange it. I’m very 
grateful to you for visiting me. Is that your horse?” 
“Yes, it is.” 


“That's why your father never uses it. It’s a fine horse.” 

“It seems so. I don’t know much about them.” 

“It’s a good horse, sir. Worth three hundred and fifty rubles, even 
more,” said the coachman. 

“How old is it?” 

“Six years old, sir.” 

“Let's go, Zakhar. I’m ready. Good-bye, Mr. Beaumont. Will you come 
to see us today?” 

“I doubt that. But tomorrow for sure.”

Does this really happen? Do young girls in love make such visits? 
Not to mention the fact that no well-brought-up young lady would 
ever allow herself to do anything of the sort, or, if she did, the results 
would be very different. If Katerina Vasilievna’s action flies in the face 
of all morality, then even more opposed to generally accepted ideas 
about relations between men and nubile young women is the sub- 
stance, so to speak, of her immoral action. Isn't it clear that Katerina 
Vasilievna and Beaumont were not people but fish; or, if they were 
people, they had fish blood in their veins? And more to the point—the 
way she treated him during this interview was altogether the same as 
the way she'd always treated him at home. 

“I'm tired of talking, Mr. Beaumont,” she would say when he stayed 
late. “Stay here and talk with papa. I’m going to my room.” And she 
would leave. He’d sometimes reply, “Stay another quarter of an hour, 
Katerina Vasilievna.” 

“All right,” she’d answer in such cases. But more often he'd reply, 
“Good night then, Katerina Vasilievna.”

What sort of people are these, I'd like to know. I'd also like to know, 
might they not be simply good people, whom no one prevents from 
seeing each other whenever they want and as much as they like, 
whom no one keeps from marrying if they so decide, and therefore 
they have no reason to rant and rave? Still I'm troubled by their cold 
treatment of each other. I'm ashamed not so much for them as for 
myself. Can it be that my fate as a novelist consists in compromising all 
my heroes and heroines in the eyes of well-bred people? Some of them 
eat and drink; others don't go wild without cause. What uninteresting 
people!

Meanwhile, according to old man Polozov's conviction, the whole 
affair was heading toward marriage. Marriage? How could that possi- 
bly be, given the odd behavior of the prospective bride and groom? 
Hadn't Polozov heard their conversations? Of course, his daughter and 
her prospective suitor weren't always within earshot; instead of sitting 
in the same room with him, more often than not they sat in another 
room or strolled through several rooms. But this made no difference 
whatever in their conversations. These were enough to convince even 
the subtlest expert on the human heart (a heart that, in reality people 
don’t possess) that there was absolutely no possibility of seeing Ka- 
terina Vasilievna and Beaumont married. It's not that they didn’t talk 
about feelings. No, they did, just as they talked about everything else 
under the sun; but they talked about feelings very little. That fact in 
and of itself meant little; the main thing was what they said and how 
they said it. Their tone was scandalous in its serenity, the content of 
their conversation terrible in its extreme incompatibility with anything 
on earth. Take, for example, this exchange about a week after the visit 
for which Beaumont had been “so grateful’ to Katerina Vasilievna, or 
about two months after they'd met. The sale of the factory was already 
completed and Mr. Loter was planning to leave the next day. (And he 
did. Don’t expect him to bring about some catastrophe. As a skilled 
negotiator, he completed the commercial transaction and announced 
that the firm had appointed Beaumont manager of the factory at a 
salary of £1,000, exactly as expected, and that was all. Judge for your- 
self whether he should get involved in anything other than business 
matters.) The shareholders, including Polozov, were supposed to re- 
ceive half the money in cash, the other half in notes payable in three 
months. (And they did. Don't expect any catastrophe here, either. The 
firm of Hodgson, Loter & Co. was very reliable.) Polozov, perfectly satis- 


422 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


fied, sat at a table in his living room counting his banknotes; he over- 
heard a conversation between his daughter and Beaumont as they 
passed through the room. They were strolling through all four of the 
apartment's rooms that faced the street. 

“If a woman or a girl is burdened by prejudices,” said Beaumont 
(this time without any Anglicisms or Americanisms), “then a man (I’m 
talking about an honorable man) is subjected to great inconvenience as 
a result. Tell me, how can a man marry a girl who has no experience of 
simple everyday relations, the kind that will arise as a result of her 
agreeing to his proposal? She can’t possibly judge whether she'll like 
her future life with the man who’s to become her husband.” 

“But if, Mr. Beaumont, her relations to this person before the pro- 
posal had an everyday character, wouldn't that give both of them a 
certain guarantee that they'd remain content with each other?” 

“Yes, a certain guarantee. But it would be much surer if the trial 
were longer and more thorough. She still wouldn't know from experi- 
ence the nature of the relations she was embarking on. As a result, the 
marriage would be a terrible risk for her. So much for her. It’s the same 
for the honorable man she marries. In general, he can judge better 
whether he'll be satisfied; he’s known women of different sorts and 
has determined which suits him best. She hasn’t done that.” 

“But she could observe life and human nature in her own family and 
in her friends’ families. And she could reflect.” 

“That’s fine, but it’s not enough. Nothing can take the place of per- 
sonal experience.” 

“Would you prefer, then, that only widows marry?” asked Katerina 
Vasilievna, laughing. 

“You've got it. Only widows. Girls should be forbidden to marry.” 

“That's true,” said Katerina Vasilievna seriously. 

At first Polozov found the conversations or snatches of dialogue he 
heard very odd. But by now he'd already gotten used to it and thought, 
“What of it? I’m a person without prejudices myself. I was in trade and 
I married a merchant's daughter.” 

The next day this part of the conversation—it was only a brief epi- 
sode in aconversation that wasn't really about that, but about all sorts 
of other subjects—this part of yesterday’s conversation continued as 
follows: 

“You've told me the story of your love for Solovtsov. But what was it 
really? It was .. .” 

“Let's sit down, if it’s all the same to you. I’m tired of walking.” 

“Fine. ... It was a childish feeling that provided no guarantee. It 
may be all right to laugh about it now, in hindsight, perhaps even to 
grieve if you want to, because there’s something very sad about it. You

were saved only by a very unusual circumstance, only because the 
matter fell into the hands of a man like Alexander.” 

“Who?” 

“Matveich Kirsanov,” he added as if he hadn’t stopped after saying 
the name Alexander. “Without Kirsanov you would have died of either 
consumption or marriage to that wretch. One could deduce from all 
this some fundamental ideas about the harmful position you occupied 
in society. You’ve deduced them yourself. All that is wonderful, but it’s 
only made you more reasonable, a better person. It still didn’t provide 
you with the experience you need to determine what sort of character 
in a husband would best suit you. Not a wretch, but an honest man— 
that’s all you found out. Splendid. But can any honorable woman be 
satisfied, no matter what the man’s character, as long as he’s merely 
honest? She needs more precise knowledge of characters and rela- 
tions, that is, she needs a different kind of experience. Yesterday we 
concluded, as you expressed it, that only widows should marry. What 
kind of widow are you?” 

Beaumont said all of this with some dissatisfaction, but his last 
words contained genuine irritation. 

“That's true,” said Katerina Vasilieyvna somewhat gloomily. “Still, I 
couldn't be deceitful, could 1?” 

“You wouldn't know how because it’s impossible to feign experience 
if you don’t have any.” 

“You talk all the time about how we girls lack ways to make a sound 
choice. In general, that’s entirely true. But there are exceptional cases 
when experience isn’t required to make a wise choice. If a girl isn't that 
young, she may know her own character. For example, I know my 
character; it’s clear that it won’t change. I'm twenty-two years old. I 
know what it takes to make me happy: to live in tranquillity so that no 
one disturbs my peace and quiet—nothing more.” 

“That's true. It is clear.” 

“Is it so hard to know whether or not those essential traits exist in 
the character of any given man? It becomes obvious from a few conver- 
sations.” 

“That’s true. But you yourself said that this is an exception, not the 
rule.” 

“Of course it’s not the rule. But, Mr. Beaumont, given the conditions 
of our life, our ideas and our customs, you can’t expect a girl to have 
the kind of knowledge of everyday relations we were talking about, and 
without which, in most instances, the girl would risk making an un- 
sound choice. Given present conditions, her situation is desperate. Let 
her enter into any kind of relations she pleases; it will hardly ever 
provide her with experience. No good can come of it and the danger is 


424 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


enormous.A girl can easily humiliate herself and learn to be deceptive. 
She’d have to fool both her relatives and society, and hide from them. 
From there it's not far to falsehood, which would truly debase her 
character. It's highly probable that she’d begin to take life too frivo- 
lously. If not, if she does remain good, then her heart will be broken. 
Meanwhile, she'll gain almost no everyday experience because these 
relations, so dangerous to her character or so painful to her heart, are 
nevertheless flashy, extraordinary, and not at all everyday. You see that 
under present conditions, this cannot possibly be advocated.” 

“Of course, Katerina Vasilievna. But that’s precisely why our life is so 
bad.” 

“Naturally we're in agreement about that.” 

What's all this? I’m not just saying that this is a hellish situation in 
terms of general concepts—but what does it mean in terms of their 
personal relations? The man is saying, “I doubt that you’d make me a 
good wife.” And the girl is replying, “No, please make me a proposal.” 
What astonishing impudence! Perhaps that’s not really it? Perhaps the 
man is saying, “I have no need to wonder whether I'll be happy with 
you; but you must be careful in choosing even me. You have chosen. 
But I beg of you, think; think carefully. It’s a matter of utmost impor- 
tance. Even though I love you very much, you musn’t trust anyone, 
even me, without rigorous and careful scrutiny.” Perhaps the girl is 
replying, “My friend, I see that you're thinking more about me than 
about yourself. You’re right: women are pitiful creatures. Men deceive 
us, lead us blindfolded so that we deceive ourselves. But don’t be 
afraid for my sake: you're not deceiving me. My happiness is assured. I 
feel as calm on my account as you feel on yours.” 

‘I'm surprised by one thing,” said Beaumont the following day 
(again they were strolling through various rooms, in one of which sat 
Polozov). “I’m surprised that in such circumstances there are any hap- 
py marriages at all.“ 

“You're speaking almost as if you were annoyed that there were 
any,” replied Katerina Vasilievna, laughing. She now laughed, as one 
can plainly see, quite often in a very gentle, cheerful way. 

“Indeed, it may lead to gloomy thoughts. If, when they have such 
poor means for making judgments about their own needs and the 
character of men, young women are still able to make successful 
choices rather frequently, then think what this reveals about the bril- 
liance and resiliency of the female mind. Women are endowed by 
nature with such clear, strong, insightful intelligence. And this capac- 
ity remains useless to society, which rejects it, suppresses it, and 
stifles it. The history of humanity would have progressed ten times 
faster if this intelligence hadn't been so rejected and destroyed, but 
instead had been allowed to function.” 


What Is to Be Done? 425 


“Youre a panegyrist for women, Mr. Beaumont. Couldn't all this be 
explained more simply? By chance, perhaps?” 

“Chance? Explain away as many instances as you want by chance. 
But when there are so very many instances, you know, besides chance 
(which produces a number of them), there must also be another gener- 
al cause that’s responsible for the rest. Here it’s impossible to assume 
any other cause except for my explanation: soundness of choice re- 
sulting from strong and insightful intelligence.” 

“You're decidedly the Harriet Beecher Stowe of the woman's ques- 
tion, Mr. Beaumont. She argues that Negroes are the most talented of 
all races and are superior to whites in intellectual abilities.” 

“You're joking, but I’m not.” 

“You seem to be angry with me because I don’t bow down before 
women. Accept as my excuse the difficulty of getting down on one’s 
knees before oneself.” 

“You're joking, but now I'm seriously annoyed.” 

“Not at me, I hope. I’m in no way to blame that women and girls 
can’t do what you think they should. Meanwhile, if you like, I'll give 
you my earnest opinion—not about the woman question, since I don't 
want to be a judge in my own case, but about you, Mr. Beaumont. 
You're a man of great restraint, but you get excited when you talk 
about this subject. What follows from this? That you must have some 
personal stake in the question. You've probably suffered as a result of 
an error in selection made by an inexperienced girl, as you would say.” 

“Perhaps I did, or perhaps it was someone close to me. But think 
about it, Katerina Vasilievna. I'll tell you when I get your answer. In 
three days I'll ask for your reply.” 

“To a question that hasn't yet been asked? Surely I know you well 
enough not to need three days to think about it.” Katerina Vasilievna 
stopped, placed her hand on Beaumont’s neck, drew his head toward 
her, and kissed him on the forehead. 

According to all precedents and demands of common courtesy, 
Beaumont should then have embraced her and kissed her on the lips. 
But he didn’t; he merely pressed the hand that she had dropped from 
his head. 

“Indeed, Katerina Vasilievna. But still, think it over.” 

They began walking again. 

“But who told you, Charlie, that I haven’t been thinking it over much 
longer than three days?” she asked, not letting go of his hand. 

“Yes, of course, I realized that. Well, then I'll tell you now. But this is 
a secret. Let's go into the other room and sit down there so he won't 
hear us.” 

The end of this beginning occurred as they walked past the old man. 
He sawthat they were walking arm in arm, which had never happened 


426 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


before, and he thought, “He’s asked for her hand and she’s accepted 
him. Good.” 

“Tell me your secret, Charlie. Papa won't be able to hear us from 
here.” 

“It seems ridiculous, Katerina Vasilievna, that I'm afraid on your 
account. Of course, there’s nothing to fear. But you'll understand why 
I’m warning you when | tell you that I have an example. No doubt 
you'll realize that we can live together. But I felt so sorry for her. She 
suffered so much and was deprived for so many years of the life she 
needed. It was a pity. I saw it with my own eyes. Where it took place 
makes no difference—let’s say New York, Boston, or Philadelphia— it’s 
all the same, you know. She was a very fine woman and considered her 
husband to be a very fine man. They were extremely devoted to each 
other. Still, she had to suffer a great deal. He was prepared to sacrifice 
his life to add to her happiness in even the slightest way. Nevertheless, 
she couldn't be happy with him. It’s good that it ended as it did. But it 
was painful for her. You didn’t know this; therefore I've yet to receive 
your answer.” 

“Could I possibly have heard this story from someone else?” 

“Perhaps.” 

“From her, perhaps?” 

“Yes.” 

“Have I still not given you my answer?” 

“No.” 

“Do you know it?” 

“I do,” said Beaumont. Thereupon followed the usual scene that 
occurs between the prospective bride and groom, complete with em- 
braces. 


xix. 


The next day around three o'clock, Katerina Vasilievna called on 
Vera Pavlovna. 

“I'm getting married the day after tomorrow, Vera Pavlovna,” she 
said upon entering. “Tonight I shall bring my intended to meet you.” 

“Of course, it must be Beaumont, whom you've been mad about for 
so long.” 

“Me? Mad about him? But it all happened so quietly and sensibly.” 

“I’m sure you behaved very quietly and sensibly with him, but not 
with me.” 

“Really? That’s odd. But this is even more curious: he’s very fond of 
you, both of you, but especially you, Vera Pavlovna, much more than 
Alexander Matveich.” 


What Is to Be Done? 427 


“What’s so curious about that? If you spoke to him about me with 
even one one-thousandth of the rapture with which you spoke to me 
about him, then of course . . .” 

“So you think he knows you through me? That’s just it—it’s not 
through me, but on his own—and he knows you even better than I 
do.” 

“That’s news! How’s that?” 

“How? I'll explain at once. From the first day he arrived in Peters- 
burg he was very eager to meet you. He thought it would be better if he 
postponed that meeting until he could visit you with a fiancée or a 
wife rather than alone. He thought it would be nicer for you to see him 
that way. You see, our marriage has come out of his desire to make 
your acquaintance.” 

“Marry you to make my acquaintance?” 

“Me? Who said he was marrying me for your sake? Oh, no, we're not 
getting married out of love for you. But when he arrived in Petersburg, 
did either of us know each other or even know that the other existed? 
If he'd never come here, how would we ever have become acquainted? 
And he came to Petersburg because of you. How funny you are!” 

“Did you say that he speaks Russian better than English?” asked 
Vera Pavlovna in considerable agitation. 

“He speaks Russian as well as I do, and it’s the same with his En- 
glish.” 

“Katenka, my friend, how happy I am!” Vera Pavlovna ran to embrace 
her guest. “Sasha, come here! Quickly. Hurry!” 

“What is it, Verochka. Hello, Katerina Vasil . . .” 

He couldn't finish saying her name; Katya was kissing him. 

“Today is Easter, Sasha. Say to Katenka, ‘Verily He is risen.’”299 

“What's this all about?” 

“Sit down and she'll explain. I still haven’t heard the whole story 
from beginning to end. Enough kissing—and in front of me, no less! 
Tell us everything, Katenka.”

That evening there was even more excitement. When order was 
restored, Beaumont, acceding to a request from his new acquain- 
tances, related his life story beginning with his arrival in the United 
States. “As soon as I got there,” he said, “I applied to become a natu-

ralized citizen. To do that I had to join some party or other.°°° But 
which one? Naturally, the Abolitionists. I wrote several articles in the 
Tribune about the impact of serfdom on the social order in Russia.3° 
This proved to be a rather useful new argument for the abolitionists to 
use against slavery in the Southern states. I became a citizen of the 
state of Massachusetts.3°% Soon after my arrival I secured a position in 
an office of one of the few large trading firms associated with their 
party in New York.” What followed was the same story we know al- 
ready. Therefore, this part of Beaumont'’s biography, at least, is beyond 
dispute.

That very evening the two families agreed to look for adjoining 
apartments. In the expectation of locating and arranging suitable 
quarters, the Beaumonts lived at the factory, where, according to his 
firm’s directive, an apartment had been set aside for the manager. This 
departure from town could be compared with the trip that newlyweds 
take in accordance with a splendid English custom, one that is now 
spreading throughout all of Europe. 

About a month and a half later, when suitable adjoining apartments 
had been located, the Kirsanovs moved into one and the Beaumonts 
into the other. Old Polozov preferred to remain in the factory apart- 
ment, the spaciousness of which reminded him, albeit vaguely, of his 
former grandeur. He also found it pleasant to remain there inasmuch 
as there he was the most revered personage for some three or four 
versts around. There was no limit to the signs of respect offered him by 
his own clerks and commissioners, by those of the neighborhood, and 
by the rest of the suburban fraternity of both lower and somewhat 
higher stations in society. And there was almost no end to the plea- 
sure with which this patriarch accepted the signs of general acknowl- 
edgment that he was the most important person in the district. His 
son-in-law came to the factory almost every morning; his daughter 
came with him almost every day. During the summer they both came 
(and still come) to live at the factory, instead of renting a dacha. During

the rest of the year, in addition to receiving daily visits from his daugh- 
ter and son-in-law (who remains a North American),2°3 once a week or 
more the old man had the pleasure of receiving guests who'd come to 
spend an evening with Katerina Vasilievna and her husband. Some- 
times it was only the Kirsanovs and a few young people, sometimes a 
larger group. The factory served as the usual destination for all coun- 
try outings organized by the Kirsanovs’ and Beaumonts circle. Polozov 
was delighted by these invasions of guests. How could it be otherwise? 
He assumed the role of host, not entirely devoid of a certain old-time 
patriarchal flavor. 


xxii. 


The two families live in their own fashion, each in the style that best 
pleases it. On ordinary days there’s more noise in one apartment and 
more tranquillity in the other. They visit each other like relatives, 
sometimes as many as ten times a day, but for only one or two minutes 
at a time. Sometimes for almost an entire day one of the two apart- 
ments is empty because its inhabitants are in the other one. It varies 
according to circumstances. When guests come, there's no set rule: 
sometimes the doors between the apartments remain closed. (The 
doors joining the parlor of one with the living room of the other are 
generally closed, while those between Vera Pavlovna’s and Katerina 
Vasilievna’s rooms are constantly open.) And so sometimes the doors 
that connect the two receiving rooms remain closed. That’s when the 
group of guests isn’t too large. But when the party is big, these doors 
are opened and then even the guests don’t know whose guests they 
are—Vera Pavlovna’s or Katerina Vasilievna’s. Sometimes the hostesses 
can't tell themselves. One distinction can be made: when the young 
people are seated, they tend to be in Katerina Vasilievna’s apartment; 
but when they're not seated, they tend to be in Vera Pavlovna’s apart- 
ment. But these young people can't really be considered guests. 
They're intimate friends; without standing on ceremony Vera Pavlovna 
will chase them away to Katerina Vasilievna’s, saying, “I’ve had enough 
of you people! Go and see Katenka now. She never gets tired of you. 
And why are you better-behaved with her than with me? I’m even 
older than she is.” 

“Don't worry. It’s because we love her more than you.” 

“Katenka, why do they love you more?” 


303. To avoid criminal prosecution, Beaumont-Lopukhov had to retain his new identi- 
ty. Chernyshevsky may also be alluding to this character's republican views and his 
desire to create a “new world” in Russia. 


430 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“IT scold them less.” 

“Yes, Katerina Vasilievna treats us like solid citizens, so we behave 
with her as if we were.” 

A particular scheme, conceived and repeated fairly frequently last 
winter within this domestic circle, when only the young people and 
some of their most intimate friends had gathered, produced a pleasant 
result. Pianos from both apartments were moved together. The young 
people would cast lots and divide into two choruses, each compelling 
its patroness to sit at one of the two pianos facing the other. Then each 
chorus stood behind its prima donna while they sang simultaneously: 
Vera Pavlovna and her chorus sang “La donna é mobile,”3°* while 
Katerina Vasilievna and her group sang “Long Abandoned by You;"3° 
or else Vera Pavlovna’s chorus performed Lisette’s song from Béran- 
ger,°° and Katerina Vasilievna’s sang “Yeremushka’s Song.”3°7 

This winter a new scheme had become popular. The erstwhile pri- 
ma donnas had refashioned to their own taste the “Discourse between 
Two Greek Philosophers about Beauty.”3° It began with Katerina Vas- 
ilievna’s raising her eyes to heaven, sighing heavily, and declaring, “Oh, 
divine Schiller, rapture of my soul!” Vera Pavlovna would reply with 
greatest dignity, “But prunella shoes from Korolyov's shop are just as 
nice,”3°9 and she'd stick out her foot. When one of the young people 
would laugh at this exchange, he or she would be made to stand in the 
corner. By the end of the game, of the ten or twelve contestants, only 
two or three remained unrelegated to the corner. Inordinate rapture 
would result if they were ever able to inveigle Beaumont to enter the 
room and then managed send him off to the corner. 

What else? The sewing establishments are still in existence and 
operate in close cooperation. There are now three of them. Katerina 
Vasilievna began her own a while back. She also substitutes a great

1865. 

306. A passage from the poem “No, you are not Lisette” (Rus. trans., 1857), by the 
French poet and writer of popular songs Pierre-Jean de Béranger (1780-1857), who was 
known for his liberal and humanitarian views. 

307. A quotation from Nekrasov's poem “Song to Yeremushka” (1859), which was very

308. A parody by “Kozma Prutkov” of a poem by Nikolai Shcherbina (1821-1869), a 
minor poet who admired Hellenistic culture and criticized the use of art for social and 
political purposes. A very popular satirist among the intelligentsia in the 1860s, Prutkov 
was in fact the literary creation of the poets Count Aleksei Tolstoy (1817-1875) and 
Aleksei (1821-1908) and Vladimir Zhemchuzhnikov (1830-1884). 

309. Prunella is a strong silk or worsted material used in making the uppers of 
women’s shoes. Vera Pavlovna’s ability to buy shoes at Korolyov’s shop indicates the 
material advantages she has gained from her cooperative sewing enterprise, self-educa- 
tion, and personal emancipation (see above, p. 54 and n. 10).

deal for Vera Pavlovna in her workshop, and will soon replace her 
altogether because later this year—please forgive her—she will actu- 
ally take her medical examinations; then she'll have no time at all to 
devote to the workshop. 

“What a pity we can’t expand these establishments; how they'd have 
developed,” says Vera Pavlovna on occasion. Katerina Vasilievna never 
replies, but her eyes flash maliciously. “What a temper you have, Katya. 
You're worse than I am,” says Vera Pavlovna. “It’s a good thing your 
father has something left, a very good thing.” 

“Yes, Verochka, it is. I feel much better about my son.” (Obviously 
she has a son.) 

“By the way, Katya, you've got me thinking about all sorts of things. 
We'll continue to live in peace and quiet, won't we?” 

Katerina Vasilievna was silent. 

“Yes, Katya, come on, at least for my sake, say yes.” 

Katerina Vasilievna laughed. “It doesn’t depend on my yes or no, but 
to please you I'll say it: Yes, we will.” 

Indeed, they do live in peace. They live harmoniously and amicably, 
quietly and boisterously, playfully and industriously. But it doesn’t 
follow that my story is at an end. No. Theyre all still young and active 
people, and if their life is organized harmoniously and amicably, beau- 
tifully and soundly, it still hasn't ceased to be interesting. Far from it. 
I've much more to tell about them and I guarantee that the continua- 
tion of my story will be even more engrossing than what I've told you 
thus far. 


xxiii. 


They live cheerfully and amicably. Working and resting, they enjoy 
life and contemplate the future, if not without concern, then with the 
firm and absolutely well-founded confidence that the further they 
advance, the better it will be. Thus passed the last two years, and thus 
this year was passing also. Winter was almost over, and the snow was 
beginning to melt. Vera Pavlovna kept asking: “Won't there be even one 
more frosty day so we can have another winter picnic?” Nobody could 
answer her question. Days passed by and the thaw continued; with 
each new day the chance for a winter picnic diminished. But then, 
finally! Just when all hope had been abandoned, there was a genuine 
winter snowfall. It was followed not by a thaw, but by a nice, light frost. 
The sky was bright; the evening would be splended—a picnic, a pic- 
nic! On the spur of the moment, no time to round up the others—a 
small picnic, without invitations. 


432 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


In the evening two sleighs set off. One rushed along amidst chatter 
and jokes; but the other was an absolute disgrace. As soon as it had left 
town, its group began singing at the top of its lungs, and what a song! 


A young maiden went forth 
From the new gate, 

From the new maplewood 
Latticed gate: 

“My own father is stern 

and harsh to me: 

He won't let me stay out late 
Or stroll with the boys, 

But I won't listen to my father, 
I'll give the lads a good time.”3?° 


Quite a song they chose to sing, say what you like! But was that all? 
Sometimes they'd be going along at a walk, dropping behind about a 
quarter of a verst or so, and then suddenly they'd break into a gallop, 
overtake the other sleigh with shouting and whooping, and as they 
drew level with it, would hurl snowballs at the other high-spirited but 
not rowdy party. The restrained sleigh, after two or three such insults, 
decided to defend itself. Allowing the rowdy sleigh to get ahead, they 
themselves picked up handfuls of fresh snow, carefully, so that the 
rowdy sleigh wouldn't notice. And now the rowdy sleigh was once 
again proceeding at a walk, dropping behind, while the restrained one 
went stealthily on and, in overtaking it, didn’t reveal in any way that 
they’d laid in a stock of ammunition. Then the rowdy sleigh came at 
them once again with an uproar and whooping, while the restrained 
sleigh prepared to repulse them valiantly by surprise. But what's this? 
The rowdy sleigh turns to the right, across a ditch—they don't care 
what they do—and whizzes by at a distance of thirty feet. “Yes, it was 
she who caught on. She took the reins and is now on her feet, driving,” 
say those in the restrained sleigh. “Oh, no, we'll catch up to them! We'll 
get our revenge!” A desperate chase! Will they catch up or won't they? 
“We will!” the restrained sleigh ecstatically cries. “No,’ the others say 
in despair. “We will,” with new ecstasy. “They will,” cries the rowdy 
sleigh in despair. “They won't,” ecstatically. Will they or won't they? 

The Kirsanovs and Beaumonts are sitting in the restrained sleigh; in

tibule.” Variants of this song were included in collections published during the 1790s.

courtship with Chernyshevsky. 


What Is to Be Done? 433 


the rowdy one sit four young men and one lady, and all the rowdiness 
of the rowdy sleigh is instigated by her. 

“Greetings, mesdames and messieurs, we're very, very glad to see 
you again,” she says, perched on the landing of the factory entrance. 
“Gentlemen, help the ladies out of the sleigh,” she adds, addressing 
her companions. 

Hurry, hurry into the rooms! The frost has turned all their cheeks 
red! 

“Greetings, little old man! But he isn’t an old man at all! Katerina 
Vasilievna, why did you describe him to me as an old man? He'll be 
chasing after me yet! You will, won't you, my dear little old man?” says 
the lady from the rowdy sleigh. “I will,” says Polozov, already quite 
charmed by the fact that she’d affectionately stroked his gray whiskers. 

“Children, will you allow him to chase after me?” 

“We will,” says one of the young men. 

“No, no,” reply the three others. 

But why is the lady from the rowdy sleigh dressed all in black? Is she 
in mourning, or is it just a whim? 

“I’m tired, though,” she says, and throws herself onto the Turkish 
divan that lines one entire side of the hall. “Children, more cushions! 
Not just for me! I think the other ladies are tired too.” 

“Yes, you've exhausted us, too,” says Katerina Vasilievna. 

“Racing you over those ruts has done me in!” says Vera Pavlovna. 

“It’s a good thing we were only about a verst from the factory!” says 
Katerina Vasilievna. 

Both sink down on the cushions in a state of exhaustion. 

“You were so foolish! You probably haven't done much galloping 
before! You should have stood up as I did; then the ruts wouldn't have 
mattered.” 

“Even we are quite tired,” Kirsanov says for himself and Beaumont. 
They sit down next to their wives. Kirsanov embraces Vera Pavlovna; 
Beaumont takes Katerina Vasilievna by the hand. An idyllic scene. It’s 
pleasant to see such happily married couples. But a shadow flits ac- 
ross the face of the lady in mourning, only for a moment, and no one 
notices except for one of her young companions.3!! He goes over to the 
window and begins to examine the light arabesques that the frost has 
traced on the panes. 


311. A sign of grief when the lady in mourning sees the two happily united young 
couples. Although some scholars have argued that the lady in mourning is the woman 
saved by Rakhmetov in Pargolovo (see pp. 289-90 above), it is more likely that she 
represents Chernyshevsky's wife, Olga Sokratovna, who is portrayed as pining for her 
own beloved, imprisoned husband. 


434 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Mesdames, your stories are very interesting, but I didn’t hear any- 
thing beguiling. I only know they're touching, amusing, and end hap- 
pily. I like that. But where’s that impossible little old man?” 

“He's fussing in the kitchen, preparing some refreshments for us. 
That always keeps him amused,” says Katerina Vasilievna. 

“Well, in that case, good for him. Tell me your story, please, but be 
brief. I like stories kept short.” 

“Tl tell you very briefly,” says Vera Pavlovna. “The story begins with 
me. Later, when it concerns the others, I'll let them tell their own 
parts. But I warn you, there are secrets at the end of my story.”3!2 

“So what! Then we'll drive these gentlemen away. Or should we 
drive them away now?” 

“No, now they may listen.” 

So Vera Pavlovna began her story. 


“Ha, ha, ha! It’s that darling Julie!313 I like her so much! Throwing 
herself on her knees, insulting everybody, and behaving without any 
propriety at all! That darling girl!” 


“Bravo, Vera Pavlovna! ‘I'll throw myself out the window!’3!4 Bravo, 
ladies and gentlemen!” and the lady in mourning claps her hands. At 
this command the young people begin to applaud deafeningly, shout- 
ing “Bravo” and “Hurrah.” 


“What's the matter? What's the matter with you?” cries Katerina 
Vasilievna with alarm a few minutes later. 

“Oh, nothing, it’s all right; give me some water. Don’t worry, Moso- 
lov3!5 is already bringing me some. Thank you, Mosolov.” She takes the 
water brought by her young companion, the one who'd earlier walked 
over to the window. “You see how I've trained him? He knows every-

315. A character based on Yury Mikhailovich Mosolov (1838-1915?), one of Cherny-

spiratorial “Library of Kazan Students” in Moscow before his arrest in 1863; during the 
1870s he participated in the underground populist revolutionary party “Land and Liber- 


ty. 


What Is to Be Done? 435 


thing in advance. Now I'm completely over it. Please go on, I'm listen- 
ing.” 

“No, I'm tired,” she says some five minutes later, quietly getting up 
from the divan. “I must have a rest. I must nap for an hour or so. You 
see, I leave without ceremony. Mosolov, let’s go and look for the little 
old man; he'll put us to bed.” 

“Excuse me, why not let me attend to this?” asks Katerina Vasilievna. 

“Is it worth the trouble?” 

“Are you leaving us?” asks one of the young men, assuming a tragic 
pose. “If we'd foreseen this, we would have brought our daggers. But 
now we have no way to stab ourselves.” 

“When they serve the food, we can stab ourselves with the forks!” 
pronounces another with the rapture of an unexpected reprieve. 

“Oh, no, I wouldn't want the future Hope of the Fatherland to perish 
before its time,” says the lady in mourning with the same solemnity. 
“Console yourselves, my children. Mosolov, put the smaller cushion 
on the table!” 

Mosolov puts the cushion on the table. The lady in mourning stands 
near the table in a majestic pose and slowly lowers her hand onto the 
cushion. 

The young men reverently kiss her hand. 

Katerina Vasilievna goes to see about a bed for their tired guest. 

As they leave the room, the three remaining occupants from the 
restrained sleigh say in unison, “Poor woman!” 

“What a woman!” say the three young men. 

“Tl say!” echoes Mosolov smugly. 

“Have you known her long?” 

“About three years.” 

“And him, do you know him well?”316 

“Oh, yes. Please, don’t be upset,” he adds, turning to those who’d 
been in the restrained sleigh. “It was only because she was exhaust- 
ed.” 

Vera Pavlovna exchanges quizzical looks with her husband and 
Beaumont and then shakes her head. 

“Don't tell me! Exhausted!” says Kirsanov. 

“I assure you. Only exhausted. She'll have a nap and everything will 
pass,” Mosolov repeats in an indifferent, soothing tone. 

In about ten minutes Katerina Vasilievna returns. 


316. A reference to the imprisoned author. Mosolov claims to have known him for 
three years, the length of time that the actual Mosolov was Chernyshevsky's student at 
Saratov. 


436 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“Well?” ask six voices. Mosolov says nothing. 

“She lay down and started to doze off. She’s probably asleep by 
now.” 

“IT told you so,” says Mosolov. “It’s really nothing.” 

“Still, poor woman!” says Katerina Vasilievna. “We'll keep apart in 
her presence. You and I, Verochka, and Charlie and Sasha.” 

“This shouldn’t cramp our style, though,” says Mosolov. “We can 


still sing and dance and shout. She sleeps very soundly.” 


If she is asleep, if it's “nothing,” then what of it, really? The distress- 
ing impression produced by the lady in mourning during the last 
quarter of an hour passed, disappeared, and was forgotten—not en- 
tirely, but almost. Without her the party gradually got under way. It 
followed the course of all previous parties of this sort. Then it really got 
going and the fun started. 

Fun—but not entirely. The ladies, at least, exchanged quite anxious 
private glances five or six times. Twice Vera Pavlovna whispered fur- 
tively to her husband, “Sasha, what if this happens to me?” The first 
time Kirsanov couldn't think of anything to say; the second time he 
did and answered, “No, Verochka, this can’t happen to you.” “It can’t? 
Are you sure?” “Yes.” And twice Katerina Vasilievna whispered fur- 
tively to her husband, “This can’t happen to me, can it Charlie?” The 
first time Beaumont only smiled, neither cheerfully nor soothingly; the 
second time he too answered, “In all likelihood, it can’t—in all likeli- 
hood.”317 


But these were only passing echoes and they were heard only at 
first. In general the party was cheerful; in half an hour it was all 
merriment. They chatted, played, and sang. She was sound asleep, 
Mosolov assured them, and he set the example for gaiety. In fact, they 
couldn't possibly disturb her. The room in which she lay was very far 
from the hall, in quite a different section of the apartment, with three 
rooms in between as well as the stairs, the corridor, and still another 
room. 


And so the party recovered completely. 
The young men, as usual, either joined the rest or were off by them- 


317. An allusion to Chernyshevsky’s imprisonment and expression of the women's 
anxiety that their own husbands may suffer a similar fate. 


What Is to Be Done? 4137 


selves, either all of them or only some of them. Twice Beaumont joined 
them; twice Vera Pavlovna drove them all away from him and their 
serious conversation. 

They chatted a great deal, avery great deal, and the whole company 
discussed things all together, but not very much. 


Theyre all sitting together. 

“Well, then, summing it up: is it good or bad?” asks the young man 
who had assumed the tragic pose. 

“Bad rather than good,” says Vera Pavlovna. 

“Why, Verochka?” asks Katerina Vasilievna. 

“In any case, life can’t go on without it,” says Beaumont. 

“There's no getting out of it,” confirms Kirsanov. 

“Outstandingly bad, therefore, outstanding,” decides the one who'd 
asked. 

The three remaining comrades nod their heads and say, “Bravo, 
Nikitin.” 


The young men are sitting off to one side. 

“I didn’t know him,3!® Nikitin; but it seems that you did?” asks 
Mosolov. 

“IT was just a lad then. I saw him.” 

“And how does it strike you now, in recollection? Do they speak the 
truth? Or do they exaggerate out of friendship?” 

“No.” 

“And no one saw him after that?” 

“No. Besides, Beaumont was in America then.” 


“Youre right! Karl Yakovlich, excuse me. ... Didn’t you meet that 
Russian they were talking about in America?” 

“No.” 

“High time he came back.” 

“Yes.” 


“What a mad idea! just had!” says Nikitin. “He’d make a good match 
for her.”319 

“Ladies and gentlemen, will someone come and sing with me?” asks 
Vera Pavlovna. “Two volunteers? So much the better.” 


318. A reference to Rakhmetov, who was in America at this time. Alluding to the 
Christian belief in the Second Coming, Chernyshevsky has his young revolutionaries 
predict that Rakhmetov's return will coincide with the forthcoming revolution. 

319. In the rough draft of the novel, the young revolutionaries conclude that Rakhme- 
tov and the lady in mourning would not make a “good pair” because both are strong- 
willed leaders. 


438 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


Mosolov and Nikitin remain behind. 

“T'll show you something interesting, Nikitin,” said Mosolov. “Do you 
think she’s asleep?” 

“No.” 

“But don’t say anthing. You can tell her later, when you get to know 
her better. But nobody else. She wouldn't like it.” 


The windows of the apartment are low. 

“This, of course, is her window, where the light is,” Mosolov looks in. 
“That's right. What did I tell you?” 

The lady in mourning is seated in an armchair drawn up to the 
table. Her left elbow is resting on the edge; her wrist supports her 
slightly bowed head, covering her temple and part of her hair. Her 
right hand is lying on the table, her fingers moving up and down 
mechanically, as if playing some tune. The lady’s face has a fixed 
expression of thoughtfulness, stern rather than sad. A slight frown 
comes and goes over her forehead, again and again. 

“And is she like this all the time, Mosolov?” 

“AS you see. But we'd better go, or we'll catch cold. We've been 
standing here for a quarter of an hour already.” 

“How unfeeling you are!” says Nikitin, looking intently into his com- 
rade’s eyes as they pass the light in the hallway. 

“This really got to you, my friend. It’s your first time.” 

The refreshments are being served. 

“This vodka is really something,” says Nikitin. “And how strong it is! 
It takes your breath away!” 

“Why, you sissie! And your eyes are red, too!” says Mosolov. 

Everyone began to make fun of Nikitin. “It’s just that I choked on it. 
Otherwise I can hold my drink,” he says defensively. They begin to 
inquire what time it is. It’s still only eleven; they can chat on for 
another half hour or so, there’s still plenty of time. 

Half an hour later Katerina Vasilievna goes in to wake the lady in 
mourning. The woman meets her on the threshold, stretching after 
her nap. 

“Did you sleep well?” 

“Beautifully.” 

“And how do you feel?” 

“Splendid. I kept telling you it was nothing. Just fatigue . . . from too 
much frolicking. Now I'll be more reserved.” 

But no, she doesn’t succeed in becoming reserved. Within five min- 
utes she’s charming Polozov, ordering the young men around, and 
drumming out a march or something on the table with the handles of 
two forks. But she's in a hurry to leave, while the others, who by now 


What Is to Be Done? 439 


are enormously cheered to see her so boisterous once again, aren't in 
such a hurry. 

“Are the horses ready?” she asks, rising from the meal. 

“Not yet, we've only just ordered them harnessed.” 

“You're insufferable! But if that's so Vera Pavlovna, then sing some- 
thing for me. I've been told you have a good voice.” 

Vera Pavlovna sings something. 

“Tl ask you to sing very often,” says the lady in mourning. 

“Now it’s your turn, your turn!” they all begin to prod her. 

But they hardly have time to speak before she sits down at the 
piano. 

“Well, all right. I don’t know how to sing, but that won't stop me. 
Nothing can stop me. But, mesdames and messieurs, I won't be sing- 
ing for you at all. I'll be singing only for the children. My children, 
don’t laugh at your mother!” and all the while she’s striking chords, 
searching for the accompaniment. “Children, don’t you dare laugh, 
because I'll sing with feeling.” And trying to make the notes sound as 
shrill as possible, she sings out: 


“Moans the blue-gray .. .” 


The young people giggle at this unexpected turn. And the rest of the 
company also starts to laugh, while the singer herself can’t keep from 
bursting into laughter. But managing to stifle it, she continues with 
redoubled shrillness: 


“".. dove, 
He moans both day and night: 
His beloved sweethea. . .”320 


But on this word her voice really quavered and broke off. “It’s no 
good—and it’s all right that it isn't any good. It shouldn't be. Let’s try 
one that will work, a better one. Listen, my children, to your mother’s 
admonitions. ‘Don’t fall in love; understand that you don't have to get 
married.’” She sings out in a strong, full contralto: 


“There are many beautiful women in our mountain village, 
The stars shine in the darkness of their eyes. 

It’s sweet to love them—an enviable fate! 

But... 


320. Three lines from the first stanza of a sentimental song by I. 1. Dmitriev (1760-1837), 
“The blue-gray dove” (1792). The stanza concludes: “He flew away for a long time.” The 
dove’s anxiety over the fate of his “sweetheart” corresponds to that of the lady in 
mourning, who is grieving for her imprisoned spouse. 


440 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


This ‘but’ is stupid, children, 
But a young lad’s freedom is jollier,32 


that’s not what the trouble is. It's a stupid objection, but do you know 
why? 


Don't marry, young man! 
Listen to me!322 


Further on, children, it’s all nonsense; perhaps this is nonsense too. 
Children, you may fall in love, you may marry—but only with good 
judgment, without illusions, without illusions, children. I'll sing to you 
about myself, how I got married. It’s an old love song, but then I'm an 
old woman. I'm sitting on the balcony of our Castle Dalton, for I'm 
Scottish—so fair-skinned and fair-haired. Nearby are the forest and 
the river Bringal. My betrothed approaches my balcony, in secret, of 
course. He's poor, but I'm rich, the daughter of a baron, a lord. But I 
love him very much and IJ sing to him: 


‘The steep bank of the Bringal is beautiful, 
And the forest is green all around; 
There my heart’s friend and I find shelter by day,’ 


because I know that by day he’s hiding and every day he changes his 
shelter, 


‘Dearer than my father’s house.’ 


Actually, my father’s house was really not all that dear. Thus I sing to 
him: ‘Tl go with you.’ How do you think he answers me? 


‘Maiden, you want to be mine, 
To forget your kin and rank,’ 


because I'm of high birth, 


‘But first you must guess what fate awaits me. 


321. The first four lines of Kazbich's song in “Bela,” from Lermontov's novel A Hero of 
Our Time (1840). The song initiates a discussion of marriage and its impact on revolu- 
tionary ardor (see n. 198 above). 

322. The first two lines of the refrain from the Circassian song in pt. 2, stanza 9, of 
Lermontov's Eastern tale, “Izmail-bei” (1832). The lady in mourning admonishes the 
young men to avoid her own sad fate. 


What Is to Be Done? 441 


‘Are you a hunter?’ I ask. ‘No.’ ‘Are you a poacher?’ ‘You've almost 
guessed it,’ he replies. 


‘When we will gather, children of darkness,’ 


because you and I, children, mesdames and messieurs, are wicked 
people, you know, 


‘Then, believe me, we'll need 
To forget who we were before, 
To forget who we are now,’ 


he sings. I guessed it long ago,’ I say. ‘You're a brigand.’ Well, it’s true; 
he is a brigand, isn’t he? He's a brigand. How does he answer, ladies 
and gentlemen? ‘You see,’ he says, ‘I’m a bad match for you: 


Oh, maiden, I'm not a good friend: 
I'm a dweller of forests deep’; 


that's absolutely true, of deep forests; ‘therefore,’ he says, ‘don’t come 
with me. 


My life will be dangerous,’ 
because there are wild beasts in the deep forest, 
‘My end will be sad,’ 


this isn’t true, children; it won't be sad, but I thought so then, and he 
thought so too. Nevertheless, I answer in my own way: 


‘The steep bank of the Bringal is beautiful, 

And the forest is green all around; 

There my heart’s friend and I find shelter by day, 
Dearer than my father’s house .324 


323. From Edmund's Song in canto 3, stanzas 16—18, of the ballad “Rokeby” (1813), by 
the Scottish romantic poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832). In several places 
Chernyshevsky altered the translation by Karolina Pavlova which appeared in Otechest- 
vennye zapiski in 1840, no. 5: 


Pavlova: Chernyshevsky: 
royal home father’s home 
guests of darkness children of darkness 
nameless .. . life dangerous .. . life 
nameless ... end sad ...end 


The song provides an allegorical account of the courtship between Olga Sokratovna and 
Chernyshevsky. The words and events correspond to the details provided in the au- 


442 Nikolai Chernyshevsky 


“And so it was in fact. Well then, I can’t have any regrets. I was told 
what to expect. In just such a way may you marry and love, children— 
without illusions. And know how to choose. 


The moon rises 

Both quiet and still; 

And the young warrior 

Goes into battle. 

The Caucasian horseman loads his gun; 
The maiden says to him: 

‘My dear one, entrust 

Yourself boldly to fate!’324 


You may fall in love with such girls and you may marry such girls.” 
(“Forget what I told you, Sasha, listen to her!” whispers one of them 
and squeezes his hand. “Why didn’t I tell you that? Now I'll say it,” 
whispers the other.) 
“IT allow you to love such girls, and I bless you, children: 


My dear one, entrust 
Yourself boldly to fate! 


You've cheered me up a great deal, and where there’s good cheer, 
there must be drink: 


Hey, my tavern maid, 
Pour some mead and wine, 


mead only because you can’t exclude that word from the song. Is there 
any champagne left? Yes! Excellent! Open it! 


Hey, my tavern maid, 

Pour some mead and wine, 
So that my head 

Will be gay! 


Who's the tavern maid? I’m the tavern maid: 


thor'’s own diary. Although advocating single life as the best possible preparation for a 
career as a revolutionary (see also n. 198 above), the lady in mourning willingly outlines 
the burdens and responsibilities of a progressive marriage. 

324. The first stanza and part of the second from Selima’s song in pt. 3, stanza 15, of 
Lermontov's “Izmail-bey.” It summons young men to continue the revolutionary strug- 
gle and urges young women to remain faithful to them. 


What Is to Be Done? 443 


The tavern maid has black brows 
And hammered heel-rings.”225 


She jumps up, passes her hand over her brows, and stamps her heels. 

“I've poured it out. There it is! Mesdames and messieurs, and you, 
little old man, and children, help yourselves. So that our heads will be 
gay!” 

“To the tavern maid! To the tavern maid!” 

“Thank you! I drink to my own health,” and she sits down at the 
piano again and sings: 


“Let sorrow vanish into dust! 
and it will vanish, 


And into our hearts, grown young again, 
Let unending joy descend,326 


so it will be—that’s clear: 


Black fear will flee like a shadow 

From the rays of daylight; 

Light, warmth and aroma 

Swiftly drive away darkness and cold; 
The odor of decay gets weaker. 

The fragrance of roses grows stronger.”227 


325. A partial misquotation from the concluding stanza of a Ukrainian ballad (duma) 
concerning the campaign against the Poles in 1637 (ll. 17-20, 11-12). Published in a 
collection edited by I. 1. Sreznevsky, Zaporozhskaya starina (Kharkov, 1833), I, 1, pp. 108- 
9, the song celebrates the success of the forthcoming revolution. 

326. From Nekrasov’s poem “New Year” (1852), ll. 27, 29-30, first published in Sovre- 
mennik in 1852, no. 1. The omitted line reads: “Let malice perish.” The passage reflects 
the optimism of the lady in mourning, who foresees the success of the revolution and 
the establishment of a new social order. 

327. From “Stanzas” (1845; Rus. trans., 1862), by the English poet Thomas Hood (1799- 
1845), who was noted for his compassion for the poor and unfortunate expressed in 
many of his poems. It is a joyful song of anticipated victory. The motif of “roses” recurs 
in the next section, after the lady in mourning has shed her black apparel. 


CHAPTER SIX 


Change of Scene 


“To the Arcade!” cried the lady in mourning. Only now she was no 
longer in mourning: she was wearing a bright rose-pink dress, a rose- 
pink hat, and a white mantilla, and she was holding a bouquet of 
flowers in her hand. She wasn’t riding alone with Mosolov. He and 
Nikitin were sitting on the front seat of the carriage, while a third 
youth was sticking out like a sore thumb on the coachman’s box. Next 
to the lady sat a man of about thirty.328 How old was the lady? Was she 
really twenty-five, as she said, and not twenty? Well, if she adds to her 
age, let her square it with her own conscience. 

“Yes, my dear, I've waited two years for this day, more than two 
years. When I met him” (she indicated Nikitin with a glance), “I still had 
only a presentiment. You couldn't say that I expected it. At that time 
there was still only a hope, but soon there came certainty.” 

“Excuse me, excuse me!” says the reader, not just the perspicacious 
reader, but every reader, growing more stupefied the more he under- 
stands. “Slightly more than two years after she met Nikitin?” 

“Yes,” I reply. 

“But she met Nikitin at the same time she met Kirsanov and Beau- 
mont, at that picnic at the end of last winter?” 

“Absolutely true,” I answer. 

“What does it all mean? Are you starting to describe events of 1865?” 

“Yes.” 

“But, for pity’s sake, is that possible?” 

“Why is it impossible, if I have the knowledge?” 

“Come on, then! Who will listen to you!” 


328. The husband of the lady in mourning. Although some scholars have argued that 
this figure is Rakhmetov, Chernyshevsky is most likely alluding to his own liberation 
from prison and his joyous reunion with his wife after the successful revolution. 


444 


What Is to Be Done? 445 


“Do you really object?” 

“What do you take me for? Of course not.” 

“Ifyou don't want to listen now, then of course I must postpone the 
sequel until you're in a mood to listen.39 I hope we won't have to wait 
too long for that day.” 


4 April 1863 


329. That is, when the reader and society in general are ready for revolution, which, 
according to Chernyshevsky's prophecy, should occur in 1865 (see n. 163 above).

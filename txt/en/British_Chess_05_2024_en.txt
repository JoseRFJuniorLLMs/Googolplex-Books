HOW THE 2024
FIDE CANDIDATES 
WILL BE REMEMBERED
A turning point in the 
history of chess?
Even before it started, the 2024 FIDE 
Candidates tournament carried weighty 
historical implications
This was the first time in its seven decade 
history that the Candidates tournament was 
held on North American soil. It was also 
the first time that both the Open and the 
Women’s tournament were held side by 
side. The call of history was there for all 
to hear.
But nerves were jangling as the event could 
have been severely undermined by bureaucracy 
and border controls. Right up to the very start 
of the tournament it was uncertain whether 
the hosts – Canada – would issue visas to 
all the eligible players (particularly Indians, 
due to a political standoff between India and 
Canada). This was yet another example, if 
one were needed, of how high-level politics 
can enmesh international chess. As FIDE’s 
CEO Emil Sutovsky put it in his speech at 
the closing ceremony in Toronto – “it was 
a long, bumpy journey at times, but we are 
very proud that we managed to pull this event 
together”. Under the stewardship of Sutovsky 
and tournament director Pavel Tregubov, the 
Candidates tournament did take place with all 
eligible players competing and the event ran 
smoothly without a single issue of note.
Indeed, the event was a fine success for 
the chess world’s governing body, the 
International Chess Federation (FIDE). 
Despite the tense backdrop of current 
international events, FIDE orchestrated 
the world’s premier chess tournament in 
Canada and even succeeded in eliciting 
a public endorsement from the Canadian 
Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. In so doing 
FIDE also acknowledged its commitment 
to increasing the global and geographically 
spread of major chess events and sponsors,

signalling a progressive shift and proactive 
mindset at the top level of the sport.
Holding the Women’s Candidates event 
simultaneously with the Open was an 
inspired move, increasing the visibility of 
women’s chess and helping put it on an 
equal footing with the male-dominated 
Open tournaments.
And what about the tournaments themselves?
In the chess equivalent of a Hollywood 
thriller, the outcome of the race in the Open 
tournament was anyone’s guess until the 
very last moment when 17-year-old Indian 
prodigy Dommaraju Gukesh (born 29 May 
2006 and referred to as Gukesh D) emerged 
victorious, becoming the youngest winner 
of the Candidates tournament since its 
inception in 1950. The previous youngest 
winner was Garry Kasparov at the age of 20.
Gukesh’s victory was decided in an historic 
game in which he didn’t even play! The 
American Fabiano Caruana and Russian 
Ian Nepomniachtchi both had the fate of the 
tournament in their hands - they were paired 
in the last round and the winner would claim 
the title. In a nerve-wracking roller coaster 
of a game lasting 109 moves and six hours, 
neither emerged victorious and the eventual 
draw handed the crown to Gukesh.
Gukesh’s achievement marks a significant 
milestone in the history of chess. It shows 
not only that the game is increasingly 
dominated by ever younger players, but 
it may also mark the arrival of a new era 
in which Indian players and India (the 
ancient birthplace of chess) become the 
new epicentre of the chess world. The 
signs are already clear – three out of eight 
players in the Open Candidates, and two 
out of eight in the Women’s competition, 
were from India.
The Indian presence was everywhere to be 
felt and seen in the Candidates – among 
the players, the volunteers and spectators. 
Each day before play got underway and 
every evening afterwards, large crowds 
mainly comprising Indians living in Canada 
squeezed in front of the playing hall, trying 
to get a photo or a glimpse of their stars. 
Such celebrity-style fandom is something 
modern chess has not seen since the days of 
Bobby Fischer. The Indian media provided 
huge coverage of the event, just like other 
top national sports in India such as cricket. 
When he arrived home in the southern 
Indian city of Chennai at 3am(!), Gukesh 
was mobbed by media crews and fans at this 
early hour welcoming him back. 
Clearly, a new chess superstar from India 
has burst upon the scene, with every chance 
of ranking alongside such Indian greats as 
Vishy Anand and (going back a century 
or so) the supremely talented Sultan Khan. 
There would seem to be little reason to doubt 
that enthusiasm for and engagement with 
chess in India is likely to explode.
Events in Canada will also surely intensify 
the pivot in the chess world to the east. The 
pivot was also confirmed in the Women’s 
Candidates where the former World 
Champion from China, Tan Zhongyi, 
convincingly won first place followed 
closely by her compatriot Lei Tingjie. Once 
again, the Women’s World Champion 
title match will be contested between two 
Chinese players – defending Champion Ju 
Wenjun and Tan Zhongyi. While China’s 
dominance of women’s chess at top level 
continues for the moment, let us not forget 
that there are also many very strong and 
rising female players in India.
The 2024 FIDE Candidates tournament is 
poised to be seen in the annals of chess 
history as a watershed moment. The legacy 
is already clear – the choice of a new global 
location for the flagship event, the rise of 
a new Indian superstar, the parallel timing 
of the women’s event signalling gender 
inclusivity, and the dominance of ever 
younger chess champions. A new dawn for 
the game may truly be upon us.
We have dedicated this issue of BCM to the
 2024 Candidates, to mark this spectacular
 chess event. We hope that you enjoy it,
 and we believe that the importance of this
 event will resonate for decades to come.

Straight from his triumph at the Toronto 
Candidates, Gukesh’s chess path took him to 
Poland for the Superbet Rapid & Blitz, where 
he faced Magnus Carlsen, among other top 
players. Given the exhausting pressure he 
was under in Toronto, Gukesh’s showing in 
Warsaw, where he ended last, was not that 
much of a surprise. Still – in a tournament 
where Carlsen won with a 10-game-winning 
streak, the 17-year-old winner of the 
Candidates played a brilliancy and was on the 
verge of bringing down the Norwegian.
BCM caught up with Gukesh on his way 
back to India from Poland. We talked 
about the Candidates, his own preparation 
and life philosophy, the upcoming match 
against Ding Liren and the future of chess 
in India and beyond.
BCM: Now that you had a few weeks for the 
impressions from Toronto to settle – how do you 
feel when you look back at the event?
Gukesh: The Candidates was a very special 
tournament for sure. The time after that was 
quite hectic and this tournament in Poland 
wasn’t great. But overall – it’s good that I had 
a setback after such a high. This will help me 
find some more motivation and work harder.
I am tired now, but not from chess. It’s 
more the travelling.
BCM: Thinking about Toronto, which moments stand 
out the most?
Gukesh: The last game after which I saw that 
I won the tournament. Also, I guess the 
most important moment was how I handled 
the round seven loss to Alireza. I think that 
really changed the way the tournament 
went for me.
BCM: How did you handle that?
Gukesh: The loss was very painful, and I 
was upset for some time. However, I 
managed to quickly recover. I had time to 
process it and it somehow gave me a lot 
of motivation.
I just tried to follow my routines. It’s always 
helpful in such a long tournament to have 
a routine that you can rely on. My routine 
consists of two things - some chess work 
GUKESH: 
The main objective
is to enjoy the process

and some relaxation. That also includes 
some meditation and yoga.
BCM: It has been commented that you come across 
as a very calm and stable person, both in real life 
and over the board. Unusual for someone who is 17. 
Where does that energy and stability come from?
Gukesh: A lot of work was put into that. I 
was not that way when I was a child. In my 
childhood, I used to get very upset after a 
game. Then I started taking mental health 
seriously. Started doing yoga and meditating. 
Once I started doing that, I made sure it was 
done regularly and it made a difference.
BCM: Do you meditate daily on a regular basis, even 
during tournaments?
Gukesh: Pretty much.
BCM: Do you think playing chess helps people become 
more focused and calmer?
Gukesh: I think chess in itself can’t do that. 
I’m obviously not very knowledgeable in 
this topic - but from what I’ve heard, if you 
are taking chess as a hobby, it does help 
you in this way. For a professional, it’s a 
different level – you have to take it very 
seriously, practice and work hard, like in 
any other sport. It’s just pure hard work and 
practice for professionals.
BCM: Who was the most difficult opponent for you in 
Toronto and why?
Gukesh: I did not have any difficult positions 
so it’s hard to say. The only game I had 
something negative going on in the position 
was against Alireza, but it was because of 
the time trouble. I think I was handling 
all the players quite comfortably. But if I 
had to pick one, I would say Alireza just 
because I lost that game.
BCM: You have a team working for you. Would you 
tell us more about them?
Gukesh: Once I qualified for the Candidates, 
we put together a team. I can’t reveal 
the names. Obviously, it’s known that 
[Grzegorz] Gajewski has been my head 
coach for the past couple of years. I 
worked previously with Vishnu Prasanna 
who currently isn’t a huge part of my 
chess team but is a mentor always there to 
support me. There are some others, but I 
would not like to reveal them yet.
Preparations were normal – we worked on 
openings, and we tried to improve my play 
in general. It all went well.
BCM: Now that you won the Candidates, the focus 
turns to the match with Ding. What are your 
thoughts?
Gukesh: It will be a very interesting match. 
He is a strong player. I am just focusing 
on doing the right thing and trying my 
best. Hopefully, it will be a very enjoyable 
experience.
BCM: What do you see as sort of Ding's biggest 
strength and something to worry about?
Gukesh: I don’t think there’s anything to 
worry about. As long as I am playing well 
and I’m in the right mindset – I don’t really 
worry about my opponents.
But his biggest strength would probably be his 
experience. He’s just a very universal player.
BCM: There have been several suggestions on where 
the match should take place – India, Singapore, 
Argentina, UAE. Where would you feel most 
comfortable playing the match?
Gukesh: I will be fine with playing anywhere 
but playing at home, would be quite special. 
I would just feel at home and there would 
definitely be a lot of interest in chess. A lot 
of kids are taking up the sport in India.
BCM: In recent years we have seen a huge rise of 
Indian chess – both in terms of the performance 
of Indian players and the popularity of the game. 
We have seen that you received a hero’s welcome 
upon returning to India from Toronto. Are you a 
superstar in your country?

Gukesh: Chess has become very popular in 
India and a lot of people respect and love 
the game. It’s one of the biggest sports 
right now. Obviously, cricket is still the 
main thing but It’s one of the biggest 
sports. Chess players are looked upon with 
a lot of respect. I’m really glad about all 
the support. I really hope it will grow and 
become something huge. I would be really 
happy to be a part of that.
BCM: How do you see the future of chess? How will 
the game change in the coming years?
Gukesh: It’s very hard to say, actually. 
Obviously, the faster time controls and 
other variants of chess  gained in popularity. 
However, from what I learnt when speaking 
with others and what I feel is that classical 
chess will remain the main thing for quite 
some time. I think chess is doing great. 
It’s gained so much in popularity. And I’m 
really excited.
BCM: And do you think that chess has adequate 
support from FIDE – that the International Chess 
Federation is doing enough to promote chess and 
help you as a player?
Gukesh: I feel that this is the case. I am not 
really into the organisational details, but 
I am happy as a chess player and I see a 
lot of interesting chess and a lot of people 
taking up the sport. So, I am sure FIDE is 
doing the right things.
BCM: Do you think that your success will motivate 
Magnus Carlsen to come back and fight for the race 
of the world for the world crown?
Gukesh: It’s not really up to me. Carlsen has 
been pretty clear that he does not enjoy 
classical chess just as much. And I completely 
understand it. He has won everything in 
chess and wants to do what he enjoys. It’s 
completely up to him, but personally, as a 
chess fan, I would be happy to see him back 
in the world championship cycle.
BCM: And for you, as a chess fan, who is the Number 
One chess player that you look up to?
Gukesh: From my childhood, Vishy [Anand] 
has been a role model for me, both as a 
chess player and as a person. Surely, Vishy 
is one of the people who had a huge impact 
on the game. Other than Vishy, Fischer and 
Magnus had this strong impact.
BCM: What are your immediate plans now when you 
get back home – to rest or start preparing for the 
match?
Gukesh: I need to process everything. Some 
combination of playing and relaxation. It’s 
quite an interesting process but the main 
objective is to enjoy the process.

BCM EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 263
The 2024 Candidates Tournament is already 
seen as one of the most memorable events 
in chess history. In an interview with The 
British Chess Magazine, FIDE President 
Arkady Dvorkovich shared his views on the 
event and its significance for chess and the 
International Chess Federation
At the age of 17, Gukesh D from India 
became the youngest ever person to win the 
Candidates and qualify for the match for the 
title of World Champion. In the Women’s 
tournament, former World Champion, 
China’s Tan Zhongyi emerged victorious 
and will be facing her compatriot, Ju 
Wenjun, in 2025 in the match for the title 
of Women’s World Champion.
Millions of people around the world 
followed the event, with particular interest 
from India which had three players in the 
Open and two in the Women’s Candidates.
Dvorkovich emphasized the importance of 
the event for FIDE’s goal to increase the 
visibility of chess - to have more players 
and more global attention which will lead 
to more opportunities for chess and chess 
players everywhere.
“The Toronto Candidates was the third 
most-watched chess tournament ever - 
just behind the 2021 and 2023 World 
Championship matches. With all major 
chess channels broadcasting the event live 
to millions of viewers daily across the 
globe, we touched every part of the world. 
Just one chess channel broadcast the event 
in 11 languages with 15 million viewers 
there alone. In the last round, when Gukesh 
was playing against Hikaru Nakamura, 
at one point there were 340,000 people 
following that game which is amazing”, 
said Dvorkovich.
He praised FIDE CEO, Emil Sutovsky for his 
role in getting the Candidates to Toronto and 
organizing the event: “Emil was instrumental 
for this event and the chess world owes 
him a huge thank you for this achievement. 
His ideas, determination, and vigor were 
instrumental in making many events possible 
and bringing about numerous improvements 
for professional players”. 
For the first time in the history of the 
International 
Chess 
Federation, 
the 
Candidates Tournament was held in 
North America. Additionally, this was 
the first time the Open and the Women’s 
tournaments took place side-by-side.
“Our decision to have the Women’s 
Candidates held concurrently with the 
Open Candidates proved to be a successful 
decision as the viewership for women’s 
games also increased. This will lead to more 
opportunities for women’s chess which has

been one of the key goals for my team at 
FIDE”, he added.
The tournament got a boost from the Canadian 
Government, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
sending a welcoming letter to the players and 
everyone involved in the Candidates.
As 2024 is a year in which FIDE is marking 
its first centenary, Toronto also hosted the 
Torch Relay Ceremony. After India, Africa 
and Europe, the torch reached Toronto and 
was presented by Dana Reizniece-Ozola, 
Deputy Chair of Management Board.
“We were pleased to share our celebration 
with the people of Toronto and the chess 
community there. Our FIDE100 project 
- successfully managed by Dana - is an 
important part of our mission and statement, 
and these celebrations will continue around 
the world, finally reaching Budapest for the 
Chess Olympiad in September”.
The event provided a big boost for 
FIDE’s social media channels as well, 
Dvorkovich noted:
“My job is to get chess noticed more and 
recognized on the global stage and numbers 
show FIDE is doing that. FIDE social 
media channels alone grew a lot during the 
event – we now have more than 300,000 
subscribers on Instagram and over 200,000 
on YouTube and counting”.
The President of FIDE also noted the 
large coverage the event got in non-chess 
media globally.
“Around 100 media companies from 
Canada, US, UK, Germany, France, India, 
Austria and other countries were accredited 
for the tournament and covering the event 
on site. All major news agencies and 
networks were regularly in touch about 
the results and video and photo material 
which FIDE traditionally provides free 
of charge. We had articles on the event 
in major global media outlets, including 
NYT, Guardian, CNN, Reuters, Al Jazeera, 
Forbes, Toronto Star, The Times and many 
others”, Dvorkovich said.
Additionally, several celebrities were also 
among the visitors to the event, which 
Dvorkovich argued provided an important 
public boost for the sport. Andrea Bocelli, 
world-famous Italian tenor and a great 
chess fan visited the tournament, as well as 
NFL star Mack Hollins. Other well-known 
people were there such as the producer 
Todd J. Labarowski, tech entrepreneur 
Michael Hyatt and others.
“Many other famous or influential people 
watched the event live from their homes  - 
several business people and government 
officials from Europe, Asia, Africa, America 
got in touch about the event with me or my 
colleagues, and that is great. Over the years 
more and more well-known people have taken 
an interest in chess and recognized the work 
of FIDE – like Andrea Bocelli for example – 
and that can only help us on our mission to 
promote chess”, the FIDE President said.
Dvorkovich also talked in more detail about 
the changes in the global dynamics of chess 
due to the immense rise of the popularity of 
the sport in India and China.
“Toronto was an important stepping stone 
in our mission to increase the visibility of 
chess globally. Not only was this the first 
major global chess event in North America, 
but – as the viewers, media interest and the 
audience in Toronto showed  - there was 
huge interest from India. 
“Chess is changing - more people are playing, 
the audience is growing and the sport is 
ever more publicly present. Growing this is 
a part of my job at FIDE and I am grateful 
to the team who carried out the work in 
Toronto  - and who are doing the work in 
many other events – and we look forward 
to doing more for our sport. As chess gains 
momentum globally, FIDE will continue 
to work relentlessly in promoting our game 
and getting more opportunities for players 
everywhere,” said Dvorkovich.

The final round in Toronto, where 
four (!) players were in real contention 
to win the tournament and they all 
played each other (!) is unlikely to 
happen again. The drama and tension 
compressed in the game Caruana-
Nepomniachtchi was a breathtaking 
example of hope and despair, chess at 
its most unforgiving extreme.
Like with the preview of this event, we 
will look at all the players in Toronto and 
analyse their performance.
THE ‘ACCIDENTAL’
CANDIDATE
The rating outsider lost half of his 
games, drawing the rest. That was only 
somewhat underperforming his current 
rating. It was perhaps understandable that 
Abasov wouldn’t fight for top honours, 
but it was curious to see if he managed to 
beat somebody.
As it turned out, he didn’t. His strategy was 
to be extremely solid with both colours 
(employing the Petroff with Black) and never 
to mind making a draw. The strategy was 
sensible, but the problem for Abasov was that 
he was simply a class below the rest. This 
meant that even though he was well-prepared 
and usually obtained good positions after the 
openings, he often ended up being outplayed as 
the game progressed. This led to mistakes later 
in the game, frequently in time-trouble, when 
his level would drop even lower. Examples

of this were his first game with Caruana and 
both games against Gukesh. As it turned out, 
scoring 2-0 against Abasov was a major factor 
for Gukesh in winning the event.
Abasov’s best achievement was drawing his 
mini-match with Nepomniachtchi. The second 
draw, played in round eight, was his first with 
the black pieces (having lost all previous 
three games). In this game, he showed good 
opening preparation in the Petroff (which, in 
fact, transposed to an Exchange French) and 
good tactical control in the middlegame. He 
only managed one more draw with the black 
pieces, in round 13 against Vidit.
Many 
people 
considered 
Abasov’s 
participation in the Candidates “an accident”, 
but it will undoubtedly give hope to many 
players who are outside the elite – seeing 
Abasov qualify, they will think, if he could 
do it, why shouldn’t I be able to do the same?
THE REPEAT
OF THE NIGHTMARE
One of the pre-tournament favourites 
bombed spectacularly. He lost six games 
and apart from drawing 1-1 with Gukesh, 
lost all the mini-matches against the players 
who finished on a plus score.
In fact, Firouzja had a repeat nightmare 
event as in the previous Candidates 
in Madrid in 2022. There he lost to 
Nepomniachtchi in round four, in Toronto 
he lost to him in round two. In both events, 
he couldn’t recover from this early loss. 
It was worse in Toronto, because thanks 
to Nepomniachtchi’s imperfect memory 
he obtained some advantage out of the 
opening with the black pieces. However, he 
didn’t take his chances in the middlegame 
complications and lost the game.

Firouzja misses the chance, but one can hardly 
blame him. Take a look at the following lines 
and the number of only moves the players 
have to find in order to stay in the game: 
28...£h5! would have forced either a perpetual, 
or would have led to unclear complications 
after 29.bxc6 ¤h2+ 30.¢g1 ¤f3+ 31.¢g2 
(31.¢f1 ¤h2+ is a perpetual.) 31...¤h4+ 
32.¢f1 ¤f5! the first tricky move for Black. 
33.¥d5 now it’s the only move for White not 
to lose! 33...bxc6 again, the only move for 
Black. 34.c4 and another only move for White 
not to lose. 34...£h1+ 35.¢e2 £h5+ 36.¢d3 
again avoiding perpetual. 36...cxd5 37.¥xe5+ 
¢g8 38.£xd5+ £f7 with a big mess on the 
board with chances for both sides; 
28...¤h2+ was another alternative. After 
29.¢g2 £g6! 30.¢xh2 £xe4 31.¢g1 (31.
bxc6? ¦f6! and Black wins with a direct attack 
on the white king.) 31...£e2! an incredibly 
difficult move! The idea is to keep the d1–
rook under attack after 32.bxc6 ¦ad8 33.£e6 
(33.£xe7 £g4+ leads to a perpetual check.) 
33...¦xd1+ 34.¦xd1 ¥c5! 35.¦f1 ¥xf2+! 
now Black forces a perpetual. 36.¦xf2 £e1+ 
37.¢g2 f3+! 38.¦xf3 £e2+ 39.¢g1 £e1+ 
with a draw. 
29.¥e6? Another missed chance. White 
had to drop the bishop back to a2, with or 
without an immediate exchange of queens. 
29.¥a2! 
¦d8 
(29...g4 
30.£xe8 
¦axe8 
31.¦d7!+– should be winning for White, as the 
rook on the seventh rank is destroying Black’s 
queenside, but the position remains very 
complicated) 30.£xc7 and the knight on a5 is in 
trouble, but for a human this is not obvious to be 
clearly winning, with the white king still lacking 
protection with a lot of pieces still on the board;
Or 29.£xe8! ¦axe8 30.¥a2 is also good 
for White, though the lines are complicated. 
For example 30...¦d8 31.¦xd8 ¦xd8 32.c4 
threatening ¥c3 or c5. White is two pawns 
down, but his pieces are much better coordinated. 
29...£g6? Missing another chance. 
29...g4! was the only way to stay in the 
game. 30.¥a3 £xd7 31.¦xd7 ¥xa3 
32.¦xa3 ¦ae8 with yet another mess, this 
time with mutual chances. 
30.£xe7 Now White is winning and 
Nepomniachtchi didn’t allow more chances 
in the remainder of the game.

30...£xh6 31.¥f7! Attacking the e5–pawn 
and threatening mate.

33.¦xg1 £xe4+ 34.¢f1 £d3+ 35.¢g2

32.¢e2 £f5 33.¥d5 The only, but 
sufficient move. White has a piece for three 
pawns, but with many pieces on the board, 
the pawns cannot show their worth. 
33...¦ae8 34.£xc7 £g4 35.¢d3 The king 
is safe in the centre as it’s surrounded by its 
own pieces.

The above game was just one example 
of the many that showed the extremely 
high level of complexity of the matches 
in Toronto. As you can see, and will 
see the same in the other games, even 
the best players in the world found it 
impossible to navigate this level of 
complexity and made many mistakes, 
especially in time trouble.
The loss had a devastating psychological 
effect on Firouzja. After two draws in the 
next two games, he lost two games in a 
row, to Nakamura and Vidit, dropping to 
-3 and out of contention. He continued 
to play fighting chess, but for him the 
tournament was over.
As the tournament was coming to a close, 
with the players getting tired, Firouzja lost 
three more games, with his game against 
Gukesh from the penultimate round turning 
out to be the decisive one for the fate of the 
future Challenger (see the game analysed 
later in the text).
At the age of 20 and with two catastrophic 
Candidate tournaments behind him, it’s 
certain that Firouzja has a lot of time to 
overcome his psychological problems. 
On the other hand, he may as well turn 
out to be the next Ivanchuk, a genius who 
could never conquer his inner demons.
These inner demons, fuelled by his 
disappointment at how the event was 
unfolding, 
exploded 
during 
round 
nine Firouzja was asked not to make 
creaking sounds (and possibly change 
his shoes for the next games) while 
walking in the refreshment area as he 
was disturbing some other players. His 
reaction was to complain about the 
unprofessional behaviour of the arbiter 
and vent out on social media. It was a 
storm in a teacup, but a telling sign of 
the tension and pressure Firouzja was 
playing under.
Firouzja’s best game was the swift 
demolition of Abasov in round 11.

to beating Nepomniachtchi with these two 
opening moves in his previous game with 
the white pieces, so here he tries again.

5.d4 cxd4 6.¤xd4 ¥g7 7.¥e2 0–0 8.0–0 
¤xd4 The most direct approach. Black 
exchanges knights and occupies the centre 
with his d-pawn. 
9.¥xd4 d5 10.¤d2 £d6 10...¥f5 11.c4 
¦c8 has been played in the online game 
Le,T (2557)-Carlsen,M (2835) from 2023. 
11.c4 White must get rid of the d5–pawn. 
11...¦d8 It was also possible to play ...e5 
first. 
12.cxd5 White had an interesting alternative 
in 12.c5!? £c7 13.f4 playing on control of 
the dark squares in the centre. 
12...£xd5 13.¥f3 £f5 Black had good 
alternatives in 13...£a5 and 13...£b5. 
The activity of White’s bishops should be 
neutralised by the rook on the d-file and the 
symmetrical nature of the position. 
14.¦c1 ¤e8 Black correctly wants to 
exchange the centralised bishop. 
15.¦c5 e5? A blunder which immediately 
puts Black on the verge of defeat. 
After 15...£e6 Black is fine, for example, 
16.¥xg7 ¤xg7 17.£c2 £b6 and Black 
will develop his queenside with ...¥d7 and 
...¦ac8. 
16.¤c4! It seems as White voluntarily pins 
himself on the d-file, but the pin on the fifth 
rank is no less important. 
16...f6? The second, and fatal mistake. 
Black could still stay in the game after 
16...¤c7 though White still keeps a big 
advantage after 17.¤xe5 (or 17.£a1 
exd4 18.¦xf5 ¥xf5 19.£c1 when Black 
doesn’t have enough compensation for 
the lost queen.) 17...¤e6 18.¥g4 £f6 
19.¥xe6 £xe6 20.£f3 with a clear 
pawn up. 
17.¦d5
The winning move. By attacking the rook 
on d8 White solves the problem of the pin 
on the d-file and White’s active pieces take 
control of the whole board. 
17...¦xd5 18.¥xd5+ ¢h8 19.¥c5 The 
difference in the piece activity is obvious. 
19...£d7 20.¥f3 ¦b8 Black can barely move. 
21.¥xa7 ¦a8 22.¤b6 £xd1 23.¦xd1 
¦xa7 24.¦d8 Black loses more material, 
so he resigned.

Nakamura. He did so by introducing a 
very interesting novelty in the anti-Berlin 
variation with 4.d3.
 Hikaru Nakamura –
 Vidit Santosh Gujrathi 
Candidates Toronto (2), 05.04.2024
1.e4 e5 2.¤f3 ¤c6 3.¥b5 ¤f6 The 
Berlin was Vidit’s main opening against 
1.e4 in Toronto. 
4.d3 Nakamura doesn’t want to go for the 
endgame. 
4...¥c5 5.c3 0–0 6.0–0 d6 This move was 
all the rage for a very long time, before it 
was replaced by the plans with ...d5 several 
years ago. There is nothing wrong with 
either move, just another case of chess 
fashion. 
7.h3 ¤e7 8.d4 c6!? A surprising novelty in 
a position where everybody was retreating 
the bishop back to b6. 
9.¥d3 After 9.dxc5 cxb5 10.cxd6 ¤g6 
Black will round up the pawn on d6 and 
obtain very good play. 
9...¥b6 10.dxe5 Nakamura goes for the 
most principled continuation, but this 
will show the dangers players face when 
entering territory that has been deeply 
analysed by their opponent’s machinery. 
10.¤bd2 was an attempt to obtain normal 
play, typical for this line. It is a transposition 
to the lines usually arising after 8...¥b6 
9.¤bd2 c6 10.¥d3. 10...¤g6 and now 
there is a lot of theory as White can choose 
between 11.¦e1, 11.a4 and 11.¤c4;
10.¥e3 d5! equalises immediately for Black;
10.¦e1 ¤g6 is another transposition, where 
apart from 11.¤bd2 White has the move 
11.a4 at his disposal. 
10...dxe5 11.¤xe5
11...¥xh3! This tactical resource is the 
basis of Black’s opening play. 
12.¤c4? The first of the several unfortunate 
choices by Nakamura. 
12.gxh3 was better. 12...£b8! is Black’s 
idea, to have the ...¥c7 resource at his 
disposal after 13.¥f4 (13.¤f3? just loses to 
13...£g3+ 14.¢h1 £xh3+ 15.¤h2 ¦ad8) 
13...¥c7 when Black regains the piece with 
balanced middlegame after 14.¥h2 ¥xe5 
15.f4 ¥c7 16.£f3 ¤g6 
12...¥g4 13.£c2 ¥c7 By here Vidit was on 
his own - the engine doesn’t show the move 
12.¤c4, so he didn’t analyse it, which means 
that he had to figure out things for himself 
on the board. He managed it wonderfully. 
14.e5 ¤d7 Going to d5 was also good for 
Black, after 14...¤fd5 15.¥xh7+ ¢h8 
16.¥d3 f5 is again the key move that gives 
Black an advantage. 
15.¥xh7+ ¢h8 16.¥d3? Second mistake 
by Nakamura. The position is extremely 
complicated and to stay in the game White had 
to navigate some mind-boggling lines, both in 
terms of finding difficult moves and accurately 
evaluating the unorthodox positions. 
16.f3!? was another curious move that was 
possible. 16...¥h5 (16...¥e6 17.g3! with the 
idea of £h2 is a rarely seen motif. Black fends 
it off with 17...¤g6! 18.£h2 ¤h4! an amazing 
idea, blocking the h-file with a knight sacrifice. 
19.¥d3 b5 20.¤e3 ¤xe5 when the mess 
continues, but Black’s initiative gives him an

advantage.) 17.g4 b5! meeting an attack with 
counter-attack! This move is the strongest, 
though Black has tempting alternatives in 17...f5 
and 17...¥g6. 18.£h2! ¢xh7 19.£xh5+ ¢g8 
20.¢g2! intending ¦h1. 20...f5! a key move 
for Black in many lines. Here it ensures there 
is no mate on h8. 21.¦h1 ¥xe5 with a very

more developed and this gives him the initiative;

an alternative, with more complications after

should survive.) 22.¤xf5 ¦f7 23.£xd8+ 
¦xd8 with good compensation for the pawn. 
16...b5! Vidit conducts the game with 
great energy. 
16...f5! was also strong, for example 17.f4 
b5 or 17...¤d5. 18.¤e3 ¥b6 when White’s 
undeveloped queenside tells the whole story. 
17.¤e3 ¤xe5 Material is equal now, but 
the difference in the activity of both armies 
is obvious. 
18.¥e2?
After this White is just lost and the rest is a 
wrapping up procedure. 
18.¤xg4 was the last try, though after 
18...¤xg4 19.g3 f5 it’s not certain that 
White will survive, though his chances are 
higher than in the game. 
18...f5 There was a good alternative in 
18...£d6, setting up a battery on the h2–b8 
diagonal. 
19.f4 19.¤xg4 fxg4 with ...£d6 next is 
devastating. 
19...¥b6! White managed to shut the h2–
b8 diagonal, so the bishop moves to the one 
next to it that opened. 
20.¢f2 20.fxe5 ¤d5 regains the piece. 
20...¤d5 Black wins in many ways. With 
their level of opening preparation, it’s 
an extremely rare sight to see an elite 
player finding himself totally lost with the 
white pieces before move 20, and with a 
completely undeveloped queenside to add 
to the embarassment. 
21.¦h1+ ¢g8 22.fxe5 £g5 Black easily 
regains the piece while the attack continues.

Truly an impressive start by Vidit, who for 
a very brief period found himself leading 
the tournament.
The disappointment followed immediately, 
when in the next round he lost with the 
white pieces to Praggnanandhaa, dropping 
back to 50%. That was another complicated 
game, where Vidit missed his saving 
chances (see the game below). It was a 
common occurrence in Toronto, thanks to 
the complexity of the games, for the winning

player to allow chances for salvation, only 
for the opponent to miss them.
In the game with Nakamura, Vidit 
demonstrated his best qualities: excellent 
preparation and calculation and a sense for 
initiative. However, he wasn’t always able 
to show these qualities.
After losing to Praggnanandhaa, he faced 
Nepomniachtchi, who decided to enter the 
Berlin endgame as he was armed with an 
interesting novelty. Vidit reacted well, the 
game was complex, but eventually, Vidit 
erred in time trouble and lost.
Another great trait of Vidit’s is that he kept 
faith in his own abilities and never gave 
up. In spite of sinking to a minus score, he 
kept on fighting and believing he could beat 
anyone. He was out-prepared by Caruana, 
but outplayed him and was completely 
winning before blundering into a perpetual 
check. In the next round he blew Firouzja 
off the board in a sharp Sicilian. The game 
was practically over by move 15:
 Vidit Santosh Gujrathi - Alireza Firouzja
Candidates Toronto (6), 10.04.2024
1.e4 c5 2.¤f3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.¤xd4 ¤f6 
5.¤c3 ¤c6 Firouzja didn’t have much 
luck with the Sicilian. Here he chooses the 
Classical, in round 10 he chose the Najdorf 
against Caruana, but he lost both games. 
6.¥c4 A rare guest in modern practice 
and definitely something Firouzja didn’t 
expect. Fischer’s favourite move is 
considered neutralised by both 6...£b6 
and 6...e6, but obviously Vidit discovered 
new ideas in these lines. White’s usual 
choice is 6.¥g5 leading to the Richter-
Rauzer Attack. 
6...£b6 Considered the safer choice. 
After 6...e6 White can play the ultra-
sharp Velimirovic Attack with ¥e3 and 
£e2 and this requires good preparation 
and revision of the lines before the game, 
something Firouzja didn’t do even in the 
line he chose in the game.

The main disadvantage for Vidit was 
his inconsistency. His tournament was 
interspersed with wins and losses, he couldn’t 
build on the momentum of his excellent wins. 
He beat Nakamura for the second time in 
round nine, completing a rare 2-0 over the 
American, but that was followed by two 
consecutive losses to Nepomniachtchi (where 
he was winning after outplaying his opponent 
after an early exchange of queens in the 
Petroff, but lost his way in time trouble) and 
Caruana in rounds 11 and 12.
The final result of -2 with three wins and 
five losses reflects Vidit’s potential when 
it comes to playing on the very highest 
level – he is capable of beating the best, but 
because of his profound calculations he is 
also prone to time trouble and big mistakes 
that can turn winning games into lost ones. 
The lessons from Toronto will be crucial 
for Vidit if he is to continue to be part of 
the very top of the chess world.
VERSATILE STYLE 
AND MIXED RESULTS
Praggnanandhaa’s second in Toronto was 
Peter Svidler. This was revealed on the eve 
of the event and was considered a major 
coup for the prodigy. An elite grandmaster 
with experience of playing the Candidates 
himself, a second to World Champions in 
World Championship matches, what more 
can a player ask from a second?
A curious question about Svidler’s presence 
was how would his own more dynamic 
style combine with Praggnanandhaa’s 
more technical and positional play? As it 
turned out, Praggnanandhaa was able to 
demonstrate versatility in his style, but the 
results were mixed.
The evolution of his style, to incorporate 
a more dynamic approach, will need 
some time. In Toronto, this was apparent 
when his fantastic opening preparation

was not quite in tune with his more

for the sharpest ones.

11.£e2 It’s possible to develop the queen

13...exd5 14.e5 ¤e8 15.e6 Sacrificng a 
third pawn, all preparation! 
15...f5 It was preferable to take the 
pawn, though it’s understandable that 
Gukesh was vary of his opponent’s 
preparation, who played practically 
a-tempo to this point. 15...fxe6 16.¤d4 
White can also try 16.¥f4. The engine 
gives Black preference in these lines, 
but the position is so complicated that a 
human sitting at the board will calculate 
for hours and still have no idea what 
is going on. 16...£d6 17.¥f4 ¦xf4!? 
18.gxf4 ¤f6 19.¤xe6 ¦e8 20.f5 and the 
mess goes on.

The position is objectively unclear now, but 
that doesn’t really help the players. It’s all 
about calculation and the feeling in which 
direction the game should go. In this game, 
Praggnanandhaa managed to catch the 
opponent in his preparation, but the type 
of position wasn’t entirely to his liking. 
When the preparation ended he started to 
spend masses of time in this hair-raisingly 
complicated position, but in spite of that 
didn’t take his chances and eventually lost 
the game. See the remainder of the game 
later in the article!

17.¦b1 b6 18.¦b3 £a5 19.d5! Still playing 
a-tempo, Praggnanandhaa managed to find 
a line that his opponent couldn’t remember. 
Objectively, Black should draw, but over 
the board Nepomniachtchi couldn’t find 
the way.

20...g6 was also possible, though this gives 
White a choice between 21.¤e6!? (21.¦d3 
intending ¤e6 or ¦xd5; and 21.¥g4 
intending ¦h3.) 
21.¤xf7! ¢xf7 The only move. 
21...¦xf7? 22.¥e6 ¤c6 23.¥xd5 £c5 
24.¥xf7+ ¢xf7 25.£f3+ ¢g6 26.¦d1 
when the exposed black king and the 
unstable position of the black pieces gives 
White a winning advantage, though not a 
forced win just yet. 
22.¦d3 This move was also blitzed out, 
though there were alternatives. 
22...¤d7! 
For 
the 
time 
being 
Nepomniachtchi finds the best moves. 
22...¤c6? 23.¦xd5 ¥c5 24.£b3! wins on 
the spot;
22...¢g8? 23.¥e6+ ¢h8 24.¥xd5 wins 
the rook on a8;
22...g6 23.£a1 is unclear, but in view of 
the weakening of the long diagonal and the 
f6–square, quite dangerous for Black;
22...¤a6 was an alternative to the game 
move, which could have tranposed after 
23.¦xd5 ¥xh2+! 24.¢xh2 ¤c5.
23.¦xd5 ¤c5? The moment when White’s 
preparation paid off. Black falters at the last 
hurdle. 
23...¥xh2+! was the correct move. Black 
grabs a pawn and exposes the white king. 
After 24.¢xh2 ¤c5 25.¦d6 ¢g8 26.£d5+ 
¢h8 27.£e5 £xa2 the analogous winning

29.¥b1 £f7 as now the winning move in 
the analogous line 30.£b2 is not possible 
exactly because of the king’s position on

Now White is objectively winning.

25.£d5+ 
¢h8 
26.¥f5? 
Praggnanandhaa was thinking on his own 
now, but failed to find the win. Again, 
we see him in a position that is not in his 
usual style, a position where he must seek 
precise moves in a dynamic situation. He 
fails and chooses a move that steers the 
game towards a technical endgame, but the 
endgame is drawn. 
26.£e5! was the winning move. The best 
line is incredibly difficult to see, but a 
player like Svidler (for example), with 
an inner feel for the initiative and attack

276
should be able to find it. 26...£xa2 27.¥f5! 
¢g8 28.¥b1! £f7 29.£b2! A series of 
difficult moves, ¥f5–b1 and £b2, creates 
an attack on the king from the first two 
ranks of the white queenside. The threat is 
¥a2. 29...£f4 30.£a2+ ¢h8 31.£c2 and 
White wins thanks to the mating threats on 
the b1–h7 diagonal. 
26...¤b7! 27.£xa5 ¤xa5 White is a bit 
better in the endgame, but Nepomniachtchi 
didn’t have trouble holding the draw. 
½–½
 
The only game where this approach worked, 
though not without hiccups, was his win 
over Vidit in the third round. The game was 
also notable for the use of an extremely rare 
and risky variation by Black.
 Vidit Santosh Gujrathi - 
 Praggnanandhaa R
Candidates Toronto (3), 06.04.2024
1.e4 e5 2.¤f3 ¤c6 3.¥b5 a6 4.¥a4 
f5!? The delayed Schliemann (or Jaenish) 
variation. The inclusion of the moves ...a6 
and ¥a4 gives the opening a different 
direction than the immediate 3...f5. 
5.d4 This is the strongest move here, 
whereas after 3...f5 this move doesn’t give 
White much. 
5...exd4 6.e5 b5 The second surprise, as 
6...¥c5 is more often played, though that 
doesn’t mean it’s necessarily better. 
7.¥b3 ¤a5 Here again Black chooses 
the road less taken, as 7...¥b7 is the more 
popular move. The engine gives White a 
solid advantage in all these lines, but Vidit 
was obviously surprised and finding all the 
engine moves that promise that advantage 
alone is impossible. We also saw the same 
situation in the game with Nepomniachtchi. 
8.¤xd4 Taking with the queen is also good. 
8...¥b7 9.¤xf5?! It didn’t take long 
for Vidit to make a wrong turn. After 
this pawn grab Black is objectively fine. 
Praggnanandhaa’s opening preparation and 
surprise paid off nicely. 
It’s possible that Vidit mixed up the lines 
with 9.0–0! c5 10.¤xf5 when the pawn 
grab is justified and the piece sacrifice gives 
White a serious initiative after 10...c4 11.a4!? 
a move that hasn’t been played before. 
9...¤xb3 10.axb3 d6! The game is very 
sharp and objectively balanced. Black 
has the long-term advantage of the pair 
of bishops, but he still needs to finish 
development and coordinate his forces. 
11.£e2 After 11.exd6 £d7! is the key 
move - Black attacks the knight on f5 and 
prepares long castle. 
11...£d7 12.e6 12.exd6+ ¢f7 13.¤e3 
¥xd6 is followed by ...¤f6, ...¦he8(f8), 
...¢g8 when Black has very good play. 
12...£c6 13.¥g5 The threat is ¤xg7 while 
at the same time White develops and stops 
Black from castling long. 
13...g6 An alternative was to play ...¤e7 
or ...¥e7. 
14.¤e3 h6 15.¥f4 15.¥h4 £e4 16.¥g3 
¤e7 and Black obtains comfortable 
development after ...¥g7 and then either 
...0–0 or ...0–0–0. 
15...¤e7 It was possible to go after the 
pawn on e6 with 15...£e4 16.¥g3 £xe6 
17.0–0 ¤e7 but Praggnanandhaa prefers to 
speed up his development first. 
16.c4 White tries to create some activity 
before Black consolidates. 
16.0–0 ¥g7 is excellent for Black: he is 
almost fully mobilised (only needing to 
decide where to put the king), with the 
bishops roaring along the long diagonals, 
while White has little to show for it.

May 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 277
16...b4 Stopping the natural development 
of the knight to c3. 
17.£g4 Vidit understands the urgency his 
long-term prospects demand. He cannot 
allow Black to coordinate at peace so he 
tries to create threats with every move. The 
queen defends the pawn on e6 and introduces 
tactical ideas on the h3–c8 diagonal. 
Still, it was better to play 17.£d3 as 
the queen is more centralised on d3 
than on g4. 17...£c5 (17...0–0–0 18.¤d2 
¥g7 19.0–0–0 leads to a very complex 
middlegame. Black has the bishops, but 
White still is a pawn up and has good 
centralisation.) 18.¤d2 ¥g7 19.¤e4 
this is one of the ideas of £d3, to allow 
for the knight’s jump to e4. 19...£d4 
20.£xd4 ¥xd4 21.¦d1 ¥xb2 22.¤d5 
with a very complicated endgame ahead. 
17...£c5 17...0–0–0 18.¤d5 ¢b8 was 
an alternative, moving the king from the 
vulnerable h3–c8 diagonal.

A mistake that turns the game on its head. 
Praggnanandhaa blunders in a position that 
is not in his style. 
19...0–0! 20.¦ad1 ¦f6 was much better, 
when Black plans to round up the pawn on 
e6 with ideas like ...£h5 or ...h5. 
20.h4? Vidit misses his only chance in this 
game to play for more than just equality. 
20.¤d5! was the correct move. After 
20...¤xd5 21.e7+! ¦d7 22.cxd5 £xd5 
23.¤c4ƒ White has a big initiative and 
Black is on the verge of defeat. Quite a 
turnaround! 23...£f5 is the only move 
for Black to stay in the game. Still, after 
24.£g3 ¥f6 25.¥xd6! ¥xe7 26.¤b6+! 
cxb6 27.¥xe7 White has a very strong 
attack against Black’s weakened king, 
helped by the presence of the opposite-
coloured bishops. 
20...¦de8 Black regains the advantage now. 
20...¥xb2 21.¦ad1 £h5! was another 
strong sequence, forcing the exchange of 
queens and leading to an endgame where 
Black has the better chances. 
21.¦ad1 ¥xb2 22.¤d5! White must 
go forward. 
22...¤xd5 23.cxd5 ¥xd5 24.e7+? Too 
hasty. It’s incredibly hard to balance the 
need for activity and the correct timing 
for it. 
24.¦fe1! ¥c3 25.¤e4 ¥xe4 26.¦xe4 
was better. In the endgame after 26...£h5 
27.£xh5 gxh5 28.¥d2! with the idea of 
f4–f5 White has very good chances to hold 
the game. 
24...¢b8 
25.¥e3 
£b5 
The 
engine 
suggests giving up the b4–pawn with check 
with 25...£c6 as better, but no sane human 
would consider it. 
26.¤c4 ¥c3 27.¥d4 ¦hg8? Black 
defends the pawn on g6, but this lets all of 
his advantage slip. 
The simple 27...¦xe7 28.¥xc3 bxc3 
29.£d4 
¦he8 
was 
much 
stronger, 
eliminating the pawn on e7 and slowly 
steering the game towards a more technical 
nature, where Black’s superior light piece 
and queenside majority should be decisive 
in a possible endgame. 
28.¥xc3 bxc3 29.£d4?

05/144

White also misses a good chance here. 
The square is correct, but a different piece 
should have used it. 
29.¤a3! £b7 30.¦d4! with the idea of ¦b4 
leads to an unclear position. On the other 
hand, it’s understandable that it was hard 
for Vidit to properly evaluate the voluntary 
withdrawal of the knight on the rim. 
29...¥b7?! The bishop will be vulnerable 
on b7 to attacks after ¤a5, so putting it on 
a8 was better. 
30.£xc3 ¦xe7 31.¤a5! This gives White 
counterplay. 
31...¦e5 32.b4? A strange decision. 
It’s commonly known that in positions 
with only queens and rooks on the board 
king safety is of paramount importance. 
Therefore taking on b7 and playing ¦d4 
would have practically guaranteed White 
against a loss - Black’s unsafe king would 
have made it impossible to advance the 
queenside pawns. 
32...g5! Not bad, but in view of the previous 
comment, it also made sense to preserve 
the superior light piece that also protects 
the black king with 32...¥a8!. 
33.h5 It’s a bit too late now for 33.¤xb7 
£xb7 as Black threatens to open the g-file 
and attack the white king. Keeping it closed 
with 34.h5? doesn’t work in view of 34...g4 
33...g4 Again 33...¥a8 made sense, but 
Black wants to be more aggressive. 
34.¦fe1? The final mistake. 
34.¦c1 ¦g7 35.¤xb7 ¢xb7 was at least 
more resilient for White, though compared 
to the comment to White’s 32nd move here 
his pieces are much worse and Black’s are 
much better. 
34...g3 Now White’s king comes under 
attack and it decides the game. 
35.¤xb7 Three moves too late! 
35...gxf2+ 36.¢xf2 £xb7 The point about 
king safety in queen and rook positions on 
full display. 
37.£f3 The only way to avoid being mated, 
but the rook endgame is hopeless. 
37...¦eg5 38.£xb7+ ¢xb7 39.g4 ¦xg4 
40.¦e6 ¦h4
0–1
 
When Praggnanandhaa played in his usual 
style he had no problems holding draws. 
He made easy draws with Nakamura 
and Caruana with the black pieces, even 
having the better chances against the latter. 
Unfortunately, he had one bad game in the 
whole event, a loss with the white pieces 
against Nakamura in round 11, which 
effectively ruled him out of contention for 
the top places as that loss dropped him back 
to 50 percent. He lost another game with 
the white pieces to Caruana in round 13, 
possibly these two losses were a result of 
fatigue that late in the tournament.
A win in the last round against Abasov 
sweetened the end, but finishing on 50% 
was probably not what Praggnanandhaa 
hoped for before the start. In any case, 
the work with Svidler, the introduction of 
sharper opening systems and the expansion 
of his style will undoubtedly work in his 
favour in the long run. He can take a lot of 
positives from this event that will certainly 
help his further rise.

THE STAR-CROSSED
CONTENDER 
Three players shared second place, with 
the tie-break putting Caruana in fourth. 
This is misleading, as Caruana was in 
fact the only player from those sharing 
second who had a real chance to finish 
tied for first.
The pre-tournament favourite for many, 
including the author of these lines, was the 
tragic hero of Toronto.
Caruana started the event slowly. He 
won in round two against Abasov only 
thanks to the latter’s mistakes in time 
trouble. In the other games of the first 
half, he didn’t really have any chances 
for more than a draw and in fact avoided 
a loss to Vidit and saved an inferior 
position against Praggnanadhaa.
The beginning of the second half of 
the tournament was identical to the 
one in Madrid – he lost to Nakamura. 
This was Caruana’s fourth(!) loss in 
a row to Nakamura with the black 
pieces, the previous three being at the 
last Candidates, Norway Chess and the 
Grand Swiss. These losses followed the 
same scenario – an opening surprise by 
Nakamura, with Caruana unable to recall 
his preparation, resulting in a one-sided 
win for White. The strange thing about 
the loss in Toronto was that the opening 
was in fact quite innocuous and it led to 
a very safe position for Caruana. Other 
explanation than “it must have been 
psychological” is difficult to find.
A few rounds later Caruana said that 
he wasn’t feeling well at that stage of 
the event, implying health issues, but 
that those had passed and he felt his 
strength coming back. This showed on 
the board as after dropping to 50% after 
that loss to Nakamura and failing to 
make the most of a promising endgame 
against tail-ender Abasov, he started to 
pick up wins.
It was high time, as his spurt started as 
late as round 10, when he beat Firouzja in 
an uneven game where both sides missed 
chances. This was followed by two wins 
in a row in rounds 12 and 13 against Vidit 
and Praggnanandhaa, which put him only 
half a point behind leader Gukesh before 
the last round.
The last round was unique in more than 
one way. Nakamura (8) was playing 
Gukesh (8.5) and Caruana (8) was 
playing Nepomniachtchi (8). All sorts of 
scenarios were possible, but it was clear 
that all players on eight points had to win 
if they were to keep their hopes alive for 
a possible tie-break for first place.
Caruana’s story in the tournament was one 
of the great comeback. He was trailing for 
most of the event, almost written off after 
the loss to Nakamura, but a last-ditch effort 
and three wins in the rounds 10-13 suddenly 
put him back where he certainly belonged – 
in a direct fight for first place.
How do you approach a must-win 
situation? 
The 
commonly 
accepted 
wisdom is that you should try to surprise 
your opponent and ideally achieve a 
position which you are more comfortable 
playing.
That is what both players tried to do in the 
most important game of the tournament.
Caruana (8.5 out of 14)

A GAME FOR 
CHESS HISTORY
The game was an epic clash, one that 
will be studied in the times to come, both 
in terms of chess content and in terms of 
chess psychology.
 Fabiano Caruana - Ian Nepomniachtchi
Candidates Toronto (14), 21.04.2024
1.d4 
Caruana 
usually 
plays 
1.e4, 
but he probably wasn’t sure whether 
Nepomniachtchi would stick to the Petroff 
or choose some Sicilian. 
1...f6 2.c4 e6 3.c3 Allowing the 
Nimzo−Indian. 
3...d5 But Nepomniachtchi sticks to the 
QGD, his main weapon since the match 
with Carlsen in 2021. 
4.cxd5 exd5 5.g5 b4 This move is 
the one that shows Nepomniachtchi’s 
ambitions. It is more dynamic than the 
standard 5...e7 and is an attempt to steer 
the game in less towards explored waters. 
However, as we will soon see, surprise 
for a surprise’s sake is not enough − one 
must also know and feel the ideas in the 
new positions. 
6.e3 h6 7.h4 g5 8.g3 e4 9.c2 An 
alternative to the more forcing 9.ge2 h5. 
9...h5 10.f3 xg3 11.hxg3 e6 Black has 
more than one option, others are 11...e7 
and 11...c6. 
12.d3 It’s also possible to start with 
0-0-0. 
12...c6 
Around 
here 
Nepomniachtchi 
mixes up his preparation. After the game 
he admitted that he mixed up all the ideas 
in the position, unsure if he should go for 
...c5 or ...c6 and the exact move−order to 
implement those ideas. He said that usually 
happens when one plays an opening or a 
variation that one doesn’t know well. 
12...d7 was the most flexible, keeping 
the option of ...c5, but at the same time 
not committing to either ...c6 or ...c5. 13.a3 
d6 14.ge2 c6 is quite acceptable for 
Black, with unclear play ahead after 15.0-
0-0 c7 16.e4 with a position that certainly 
would have favoured both players as it 
offers chances to both of them;
12...c5 is possible, but likely somewhat 
inferior as after 13.ge2 c6 14.a3 xc3+ 
15.xc3 White has a stable advantage 
thanks to the better pawn structure and 
superior bishop. 
13.0-0-0 Most likely Caruana didn’t 
remember the exact move−orders, but he 
remembered the idea of setting up his 
pieces: 0-0-0 and then e4 or f4 with f3 or 
ge2, depending on circumstances. 
13.a3!? was likely more precise, as it more or 
less forces Black to give up the bishop pair. 
13...xc3+ (13...d6?! 14.f4! gxf4 15.gxf4 
gives White an advantage as Black cannot 
continue development with ...d7 in view 
of f5, trapping the bishop on e6.) 14.xc3 
d7 15.e2 with a more pleasant position 
for White, mainly because of the uncertain 
future residence for the black king. 
13...d7 14.f4 This must have been 
Caruana’s idea in his preparation. 
14.a3 again was possible; 14.e4 was an 
alternative central push. After 14...dxe4 
15.fxe4 f6 16.ge2 the position is 
quite sharp. 
14...g4 One of the possible replies. 
14...gxf4 15.exf4 (15.gxf4?! f6 allows 
Black to establish control over the 
central light squares.) 15...g4 16.e1+ 
f8 17.f3 with unclear play. Possibly 
Nepomniachtchi was worried about the 
position of his king and had an intention to 
castle long, as in the game;

May 2024
BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 281
14...f6 15.f3 g4 16.e5 is better for 
White − Black closed the kingside, but 
now has a pawn on h5 that needs constant 
defence, in addition to allowing a strong 
knight on e5. 
15.f3 White finishes development, though 
playing 15.e1 was a decent alternative. 
15...e7 Preparing long castling, but Black 
had two interesting alternatives. 
15...gxf4!? 16.exf4 xf3 17.gxf3 f6 the 
queen is well placed on f6, eyeing the pawn on

16...xc3?! The first step in the wrong direction. 
16...dxe4 was the correct way for Black not to 
end up in an inferior position. After 17.xe4 
gxf4 White has tempting options, but Black 
manages to stay afloat. 18.xc6!? opening 
the e−file and threatening e1. (18.he1 0-0-0

21.c6 fc8 22.d5 with a very messy position 
where Black has definite counterplay. 
17.xc3 xf3 17...gxf4? 18.exd5 wins for

The real mistake that puts Black on 
the verge of a loss. The game hadn’t 
gone Nepomniachtchi’s way from the 
beginning. His opening choice didn’t 
give anything in particular. Slowly he 
drifted into an inferior position, without 
a single chance to take over the initiative 
and play for more than just equality. 
This gradual pressure that he was feeling 
now results in a bad move and from 
this moment until the end of the game 
it’s pure survival mode for him. On the 
other hand, everything was going ideally 
for Caruana: he made the most of the 
opening, forced a mistake and is now on 
the verge of obtaining a winning position. 
20...h4! was the only way to stay in the 
game. 21.b1 0-0-0 22.d5 was Caruana’s 
intention. It was indeed the strongest 
continuation. Black is still worse, but

is the best move, after which White is 
objectively winning, but a lot of lines still 
remain to be calculated. 
21...h4 21...e5 22.gxh5 is practically a 
pawn up for White;
21...b8 was the most resilient, but still 
winning for White after some difficult

a) 23.c2 keeps an advantage, but is not 
winning; 
b) 23.d7?! this is flashy and very 
dangerous, but in fact allows Black to escape 
if he finds the following line: 23...xd7! 
(23...xd7? 24.c7+! a8 25.xh5! hg8 
26.c6! a beautiful move, threatening

mate. 27...c5 28.xc5 xc5+ 29.xc5

xd6 24.xh5 e3+ 25.b1 xf3 was

22.dxc6 c5 23.f5+ By here time 
trouble was starting to become a factor 
for Caruana. 
23...b8 24.b1! A strong move, taking

25.d7 One of the possible ways to win.

The beginning of the culmination of 
the first drama in this game. With very 
little time on the clock, Caruana was still 
looking for a clear−cut win, but never 
managed to find one. The reason for this 
was simple − there were several clear−cut 
wins, but the tension and the pressure 
clouded his vision. The move played in 
the game is perfectly fine and for the time 
being things still go as planned. 
34.f4 "Maybe should have played this 
quickly, put the bishop on h1 and push the 
pawns." − Caruana in the press conference. 
34...b8 35.a3 A move that shows that 
White still hadn’t found the clear−cut win. 
A clear−cut win means one thing in this 
position − elimination of the only source of 
Black counterplay, the pawn on h2. 
The easiest way to do this was by 35.d2 
and the game would have been over − the 
pawn on h2 is lost. This was the moment 
where it was the simplest for White to 
wrap the game up. The main point is that 
Black doesn’t have the defence 35...c5 
in view of 36.xd8+ xd8 37.xh2+ 
with check, when the two extra pawns 
make it easy for White;
35.h1 with the same idea is less 
precise in view of 35...f6 36.xc7+ 
xc7 37.xh2 xe4 38.fxe4 d1+ 
39.c2 g1 and Black keeps some 
practical chances, though this should 
also be winning.

35...e5 36.h6 Attacking the pawn on

36...c7 37.g5 White misses a second 
chance for the simple 37.d2. 
37...g8 38.h1 With no pin on the 
d−file, White finally decides to address the 
issue with the h2-pawn. Nothing has been 
spoiled yet. 
38...c5 39.h7? Played with seconds 
left on the clock and a very bad move, 
as it complicated the win to a big 
extent. Why Caruana didn’t play the 
most natural 39.c2, followed by the 
capture of the pawn on h2 on move 
40 is beyond our understanding. He 
couldn’t explain it himself in the press 
conference after the game. It’s as if the 
players unwillingly and unknowingly 
followed an invisible script. 
39...xg5! Caruana saw this, but he thought 
it was winning. 
40.xg5 40.xh2? is a draw after 
40...xh2 41.xh2 g1+ 42.a2 f1.
40...xh7+ 41.a1? Caruana said he 
shouldn’t have rushed with this, but by 
here he must have realised how annoying 
it was to allow this position to happen in 
the first place. 
41.a2! was winning, allowing checks, 
but destroying the coordination of the 
black pieces in the process. 41...f7+

42.a1 b3+ 43.b1 xf3 44.e5+

some time, White will win this. 
41...c2 Now the game is objectively 
drawn. However, the drama continues 
as the problems the players have to 
solve persist and the complications 
only increase.

After 
a

defence, 
it 
is

hand another chance to his opponent. 
44...a6 was the only move. After 
45.a8+ b5 46.d5 a6 Caruana was 
panicking as he didn’t see what he could do 
here. The position is drawn as White indeed 
cannot make further progress.

still not simple. 
45...a6 46.c3 g2 47.c4+ b7 
48.e1! Correctly activating the rook 
for the attack on the king. That pawn 
on h2, that White was so focused on 
eliminating, survived all the storms and 
stayed alive, though now that shouldn’t 
have mattered.

56...a7 57.c1 b3+ 58.a1 e6 
59.c7+? The players received 30 minutes 
after move 40, so in spite of having a 30-
second increments, the positions were often 
complicated enough and those 30 minutes 
were insufficient for proper calculation 
and understanding. By here Caruana was 
getting into eternal time−trouble and he errs 
again. It won’t be the last time... 
59.e1 was by far the simplest. White 
finally captures the pawn on h2 and 
should win after 59...b3+ 60.a2 
xf6 61.xh2; 
59.d1 b3+ 60.b1 was similar − White 
manages to take on h2 after 60...f5+ 
61.a2 xf6 62.xh2 
59...a6 Now Black shouldn’t lose. 
60.f7

61.b1

Nepomniachtchi. 
He had to see that after 61...d2+! 62.c2 
f5+! 63.xd2 f2+ there is a perpetual 
check on the board. 
62.a2 White is winning again. 
62...c5 63.a8+ b5 64.c6+ The 
first omen. It would have been ideal 
if Caruana saw the winning sequence 
and played this just to gain time on 
the clock, but if he had seen it, he 
would have played it immediately, as 
there would not have been a need for 
extra time in that case. The fact that 
he repeated meant he didn’t see it. His 
reaction at the press conference when 
shown the "two−move tactic" (as he 
called it) was one of complete despair 
and devastation. 
64.e8+ a6 65.e2+ was missed 
by both players. It’s a check and White 
picks up the h2-pawn. This is important 
from a practical perspective in the game, 
though the engine says it’s a forced 
mate from here.

In spite of getting so close, the tension, the 
pressure, the complexities of the variations 
that needed to be calculated and the time 
trouble all put together were too much for 
one of the best players of our time. Credit 
also must go to his opponent, who managed 
to put up tremendous resistance and make it 
as hard as possible. 
Immediately after the game finished the 
players discussed a few lines. When this 
exchange died off there was a moment of 
silence and then Nepomniachtchi uttered 
“I’m very sorry,” to which Caruana, 
already standing up from the board, 
muttered “My fault.” 
There are no prizes for second place 
in the Candidates and Caruana will 
consider his result a failure, mostly 
because of the last game. The main 
question is how this will affect him in 
the future? Will he find it in himself for 
another assault at the Candidates in two 
years? For the good of chess, I hope 
so, but that is a question only Caruana 
can answer.
WHEN 40 OUT OF 42
ISN’T ENOUGH
If we take into account the current 
and the previous two Candidates 
tournaments, each having 14 rounds, for 
a total of 42 rounds, Nepomniachtchi 
has been in the lead, either alone or 
shared, in 40 of them. The only time 
he wasn’t in the lead was after the 
penultimate round in Toronto!
After the last game with Caruana, it was 
visible that Nepomniachtchi was dismayed. 
However, as the game went, he shouldn’t 
really blame himself – he didn’t have a 
single chance in that game and his only 
hope was not to lose. A far cry from the 
win he needed.
Toronto was far from the smooth sailing 
in Madrid, where things were going his 
way in every possible way. Additionally, 
Nepomniachtchi was less convincing 
this time.
After the draw against Abasov in the 
first round, Nepomniachtchi won against 
Firouzja in the second. We saw the game 
above, it was in fact Firouzja’s bad play 
that allowed him to win, rather than his 
own superior play.
Nevertheless, things started looking 
even worse as he was lost against 
Gukesh in round three, allowing himself 
to be outplayed from an equal endgame 
(see the game below). Then he was lost 
against Praggnanandhaa (see above for 
the details) and then against Nakamura in 
round seven. These were all consecutive 
games with the black pieces and he 
continued to suffer as he was almost 
lost against Firouzja in round nine. In 
round 11 he ended up lost from an equal 
endgame against Vidit, but managed to 
turn it around and even win. So many 
avoided losses sometimes give the player 
the sensation that things are, indeed, 
going his way and he should try to ride 
his luck. However, Nepomniachtchi 
didn’t really manage and this indicates 
that his level wasn’t as high as the one 
he demonstrated in Madrid.
When playing with White, he played 
openly for a draw in his games 
with Caruana in round seven and 
Nepomniachtchi 
(8.5 out of 14)

Praggnanandhaa in round 12. Not trying 
to win with White is usually a bad idea 
and it’s not quite clear what he was 
hoping for with a lot of competition for 
the first place.
His best chance in the tournament was 
in the penultimate round, when thanks to 
his opponent’s mixed-up preparation, he 
suddenly obtained excellent winning chances.

This was blitzed-out by Nakamura, but soon it

14...d6! was the correct contination, with the 
idea of ...f5. 15.¥b3 (Now in case of 15.¤f3 
d5! is strong, even with a loss of tempo, as the

This soft move epitomises Nepo’s play in 
Toronto. He just wasn’t keen enough and 
lacked the energy to follow through in the 
rare cases when he got a chance to convert 
his advantage. In fact, in spite of winning 
two games with White, this game was the 
only one for him where he got an advantage 
out of the opening, which together with the 
fact that he was in trouble in all his black 
games, indicates that his preparation left 
much to be desired. It’s really strange how 
he didn’t play any of the three relatively 
simple moves that guaranteed White a 
stable advantage. 
17.d5 was natural and very good. White 
fixes the pawn on c7 and his IQP becomes 
a strength;
17.¦c1 b6 transposes to the advantageous 
lines analysed after 16...b6;
17.¤c5 was another very good option. 17...
b6 18.¤e6 ¥xe6 19.¦xe6 b5 20.¥b3 and 
Black is very passive while White can press 
without any risk. 
17...f5 Black is out of the woods now. 
17...b6 was another good move for 
Black. 18.d5 f5 19.¤g3 ¥b7= attacks 
the pawn on d5 and after 20.¥xf5 £xd5 
21.£xd5 ¥xd5 the game is headed for 
a draw. 
18.¤c5 A move too late. 
18...b6 19.¤d3 This move took Nakamura 
by surprise. It’s another relatively soft 
move 
by 
Nepomniachtchi, 
allowing 
simplifications and a draw. 
19.¤e6 was what he expected and was 
the more natural continuation. After 
19...¥xe6 20.¦xe6 ¤f4 21.¦e5 £d7 
was Nakamura’s intention, with ideas like 
...¤g6 and ...¦ad8. (21...£g5 may be even 
better, when Black doesn’t have problems.) 
19...¥b7 19...£xd4 was possible and it 
would have led to a draw after 20.¤e5 
£xd1 21.¤xg6+ hxg6 22.¦axd1 ¥b7 
23.¦d7 ¦fe8. 
20.¤e5 £g5 20...¤f4 could have led to an 
interesting perpetual after 21.f3 £g5 22.g3 
¤h3+ 23.¢g2 ¤f4+. 
21.d5 Shutting the long diagonal. 
21...¦ad8 Nakamura spent 27 minutes on 
this move. 
The simplest way to draw was 21...¤xe5 
22.¦xe5 ¦ae8 23.£d4 ¦xe5 24.£xe5 £f6 
25.£xc7 ¥xd5 with complete equality;
21...¤f4 led to complications after 
22.g3 ¤h3+ (22...¤xd5? allows a 
beautiful combination after 23.¥b3 
¦ad8? 24.¥xd5 ¥xd5 25.£xd5! ¦xd5 
26.¤f7+ winning a piece.) 23.¢g2 
(23.¢f1? f4 gives Black a winning 
attack.) 23...¤f4+ (23...¥xd5+? 24.f3! 
is suddenly winning for White after 
24...¤f4+ 25.¢h1 as his pieces are 
hanging.) 24.¢f1 avoiding a repetition. 
24...¤xd5 25.¥b3 £d8 (25...¦ad8? 
26.¥xd5 ¥xd5 27.£xd5! is the same 
combination based on the weak back 
rank and the fork on f7.) 26.¦c1 with 
good compensation for White;
22.¥b3 c5!? Nakamura keeps the game 
going. The move is risky as now the d5–
pawn is a passed one, but on the other hand 
Black hopes his queenside majority starts 
moving with ...b5 and ...c4 and then the d5–
pawn may lose its support. 
22...¥xd5 was the way to draw: 23.¥xd5 
¤xe5 24.¦xe5 c6 with an equal position 
after Black regains the piece. 
23.¤f3 Nakamura was very upset when 
Nepomniachtchi played this, after having 
spent a long time calculating other moves 
and now facing a move that he didn’t think 
was good. 
23.£f3!? b5 24.¦ad1 c4 25.¥c2 ¦d6 leads 
to a double-edged position;

23.¤xg6+ hxg6 (23...£xg6 24.¦e6 is 
good for White.) 24.£f3 (24.¦e6?! b5 
was what Nakamura expected, but this 
is good for Black.) 24...b5 25.¦e7 ¥a8 
26.£c3 £f6 27.£xc5 ¥xd5 and the 
position peters out to a draw. 
23...£h5 Nakamura said that if he 
had more time he would have played 
23...£h6 to continue the game. 24.a4

threatens ...c4.) 24...¤f4 25.£c1 ¥xd5 
26.¥xd5

27.£c4 
Nakamura 
thought this was hard to judge, but felt it 
was easier to play for White. (27.¤e5!? 
was also mentioned by Nakamura, with 
an unclear position.) 
24.¤e5 
Nepomniachtchi 
repeats 
the 
position and the game ends in a draw. 
24.a4 to stop ...b5 was an attempt to 
play on, but after 24...¤f4 White needs 
to seek safe haven. 25.¤e5 leads to 
simplifications and a draw after (25.¦e5?! 
c4! 26.¥xc4 ¤xg2! weakens the white 
king and gives Black good compensation 
after 27.¥xa6 ¥xa6 28.¢xg2 £g4+

b5³; 24.¦c1 ¤f4.
24...£g5 25.¤f3 £h5 26.¤e5 £g5
½–½
 
Nepomniachtchi didn’t have the same 
energy and preparation as in Madrid and 
this made it very hard to compete for 
the top places. The fact that he managed 
speaks volumes of his practical strength 
and tenacity.
Nepomniachtchi will be disappointed 
with second place, but looking at his 
chances, he really had only one (on move 
17 in the game with Nakamura). This may 
well be the motivation for another try in 
two years.
SUSPICIOUS SURPRISES 
The only non-professional in the event 
fared really well. He followed the same 
strategy as in Madrid and the result 
was similar.
Nakamura’s strategy was to surprise his 
opponents in the openings as early as 
possible, even using suspicious variations 
with the black pieces. It worked pretty well 
until the last round, when it counted the 
most. Perhaps that was the price to pay for 
being a non-professional.
Nakamura’s surprises with the black 
pieces were indeed unexpected. Take a 
look at the following ideas:
 Fabiano Caruana – Hikaru Nakamura
Candidates Toronto (1), 04.04.2024
1.e4 c5 2.¤f3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.¤xd4 
¤f6 5.¤c3 e5?! It has been known for 
many decades that this is not very good. 
Caruana managed to remember the best 
way for White and obtained a stable 
advantage, but Nakamura managed 
to escape. 
½–½

 Gukesh D  - Hikaru Nakamura 
Candidates Toronto (6), 10.04.2024
1.e4 c5 2.¤f3 g6 An extremely rare guest 
at top level. 
3.c3 Gukesh was obviously surprised and 
chooses a safe line. 
One can only wonder what Nakamura had 
in mind after 3.d4; 3.c4 would have almost 
certainly led to the Maroczy bind, where 
Black is solid, but it would have been 
interesting to know which set-up Nakamura 
had in mind to employ. 
3...d5 4.e5 ¥g4 5.¥b5+ ¤c6 6.¥xc6+ 
The surprise worked. This is slightly 
premature and it allows Black to equalise. 
6.d4 is better, which should give White 
an advantage. 
6...bxc6 7.0–0 c4!? And Nakamura didn’t 
have many problems obtaining good play. 
½–½
 
 Praggnanandhaa R  -
 Hikaru Nakamura 
Candidates Toronto (11), 17.04.2024
1.d4 d5 2.¤f3 ¤f6 3.c4 c5 This symmetrical 
way of playing has been used regularly by 
Mamedyarov and works better when White 
already has a knight on f3. It was quite a 
revelation when Nakamura said he would have 
played ...c5 even in the case of 2.c4 by White. 
4.cxd5 cxd4 5.£xd4 £xd5 6.¤c3 £xd4 
7.¤xd4 a6 8.g3 e5 9.¤b3 ¤c6 10.¥g2 
a5 And Black was doing quite alright in the 
endgame. This was Praggnanandhaa’s worst 
game in the tournament, but that doesn’t mean 
that Nakamura doesn’t deserve credit for 
outplaying his young opponent in the endgame. 
0–1
We also saw the delayed Cordell in the 
game with Nepomniachtchi above.
Things were working well with Black, 
but his openings with the white pieces 
were not as effective as in Madrid. He 
was caught out by Vidit in round two, 
he didn’t achieve anything in his games 
with Praggnanadhaa and Caruana (in 
spite of winning the latter), but most 
importantly, he failed completely in the 
decisive game of the last round and the 
whole tournament.
Hikaru Nakamura  - Gukesh D
Candidates Toronto (14), 21.04.2024
1.d4 For the first time in the tournament, 
Nakamura opens with 1.d4. 
1...d5 2.c4 dxc4 The first surprise for 
Nakamura. Curiously enough, the QGA 
was also Nakamura’s choice in the last 
round of the Madrid Candidates when he 
faced Ding Liren, with a draw securing 
him second place. The opening worked 
well but Nakamura lost an endgame he 
shouldn’t have. 
3.¤f3 ¤f6 4.e3 e6 5.¥xc4 ¥e7!? The 
second surprise, to which Nakamura didn’t 
find a response that would have given him a 
position with chances to have a game. 
6.¤c3 Possibly premature. It was better 
to castle, keeping the options open for 
the queenside. 
6...c5 7.a3 Again showing his cards too 
early. Castling offered more options. 
7...0–0 8.0–0 a6 9.£e2 A choice dictated by 
the tournament situation. 
9.dxc5 £xd1 10.¦xd1 ¥xc5 11.¥e2 with 
the idea of b4 would have been Nakamura’s 
choice if he wasn’t obliged to play for a 
win at all costs.

Nakamura spent 10 minutes on this 
recapture, but this allows Black to sterilise 
the position. 
11.¦d1!? was what Nakamura thought 
he should have played. 11...b4 (11...¤c6 
12.exd4 and White has d5–ideas at 
his disposal; 11...d3 12.¦xd3 £c7 
Nakamura didn’t like the symmetrical 
structure for a must-win game, but this 
was still better than the position he got 
in the game.) 12.¦xd4 (or 12.axb4 ¤c6 
13.¤xd4 £c7 14.¤xc6 £xc6 15.e4 
with a bit more play than in the game.) 
12...£c7 13.axb4 ¤c6 14.¦c4 was a line 
Nakamura considered. 
11...b4! The move that sealed Gukesh’s 
win in Toronto. Nakamura was already 
very disappointed after this move. The 
move has already been played before, but 
neither player was aware of that during 
the game.

¥e7 20.¦h3 g6 which is already much

that the risk/reward ratio wasn’t there. 
13...¥b7 14.¤c3 He didn’t want to make

Black established control over the d5–
square and is objectively better. Even more 
importantly, he cannot possibly lose this 
position and White has zero chances for 
anything more than a draw. This was the 
end of Nakamura’s chances and in spite of 
the fact that the game continued until move 
71, the rest was only keeping the game 
going for the sake of it.

Like 
Nepomniachtchi, 
it’s 
hard 
for 
Nakamura to blame himself. He simply 
didn’t have a chance as the opening didn’t 
work out.
On the brighter side, he won five games, 
the same number as the winner. 
Nakamura won three games in a row 
in rounds 10-12. However, unlike in 
Madrid, where he was ruthless when it 
came to converting his advantage, in 
Toronto he often allowed chances to his 
opponents. Here’s an example from his 
game with Firouzja.
  Hikaru Nakamura - Alireza Firouzja 
Candidates Toronto (12), 18.04.2024
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 The exchange 
French turned out to be quite popular, but in 
several games it arose from the Petroff after 
the moves 1.e4 e5 2.¤f3 ¤f6 3.¤xe5 d6 
4.¤f3 ¤xe4 5.d3 ¤f6 6.d4 d5. Nakamura 
already entered it like that in his game 
against Abasov. 
3...exd5 4.¤f3 ¥d6 5.c4 ¤f6 5...dxc4 
is a major alternative, after 6.¥xc4 ¤f6 
White has a choice between 7.0–0 (and 
7.£e2+).
6.c5 Nakamura doesn’t allow Black to 
play ...c6 and keep the bishop on the h2–
b8 diagonal. 
6...¥e7 7.£a4+ Provoking either ...c6 or 
...¥d7. 
7.¥d3 0–0 8.0–0 ¥g4 9.h3 ¥h5 
10.¥e3 was played in the game Ju,W 
(2549)-Firouzja,A (2759) Wijk aan Zee 
NED 2024, analysed in the February 
issue of BCM. 
7...¥d7 8.£c2 0–0 9.¥e3 ¤c6 10.¤c3 
b6 A move that took Nakamura out 
of book. The game becomes very 
sharp now as Black tries to blow up 
White’s centre. 
11.¥e2 ¤b4 11...bxc5 12.dxc5 d4 
13.¤xd4 ¤b4 14.£d2 ¥xc5 15.0–
0 is better for White, who has the 
better structure. 
12.£d2 ¥f5 Threatening ...¤c2. 
13.¦c1 ¤g4 14.¥f4 It was in fact 
possible to let Black take on e3 after 
14.0–0 ¤xe3 15.fxe3 because after 15...
bxc5 16.dxc5 White threatens ¤d4. 
14...bxc5 15.dxc5 ¥xc5 16.0–0 White 
sacrificed a pawn, but all Black’s pieces 
are loose and unstable. The position is 
extremely tactical. 
16...¦e8 16...¤f6 17.¥g5 d4 18.¤b5 
this move is key to exposing Black’s 
position - everything hangs now. 18...
d3 19.¦xc5 dxe2 20.¦e1! (20.£xe2? 
¥d3 wins for Black.) 20...£xd2 (or 
20...¤d3 21.¦xf5 ¤xe1 22.¤xe1 £xd2 
23.¥xd2 and the pawn on e2 will 
fall sooner or later.) 21.¥xd2 ¤bd5 
22.¤xc7 when White will emerge with 
an extra pawn when the pawn on e2 
is captured. 
17.a3 d4?! Objectively not the best 
move, but definitely a tempting one. 
17...¤xf2! was best. 18.¦xf2 ¥xf2+ 
19.¢xf2 ¦xe2+! 20.¤xe2 (or the 
strange looking 20.¢xe2 ¤d3 21.¦a1 
where White is a piece up, but Black 
has compensation.) 20...¤d3+ 21.¢g3 
¤xc1 22.£xc1 Nakamura thought 
he was better here, but it is only a 
marginal advantage;
17...¤c6? 18.¤b5White is winning.
18.¤b5 d3 Here 18...¦xe2? doesn’t work 
in view of 19.£xe2 ¥d3 20.£d2 ¥xb5 
21.¦xc5 ¥xf1 22.£xb4 ¥a6 23.¥xc7 
and White should be winning after

Based on a misevaluation of the correct move.

he is, after the only move 22.¥c7! (22.¥b3?! 
¤gf6 and Nakamura correctly thought Black 
was OK) 22...¤xc7 (22...£d7 23.£a5! is 
winning, though not easy to understand that 
with still a lot of pieces scattered over the 
board.) 23.¦xf5 ¤f6 24.¦e5 and the pawn on 
d3 is a weakness rather than a strength. 
19...dxe2 20.¦e1 ¤d3 21.¦xf5 ¤xe1? A 
tactical mistake by Firouzja. 
21...£d7! Nakamura wasn’t sure what was 
happening after this move. He spent 25 
minutes on 19.¦c5 calculating this move.

Played after five minutes. Nakamura

passed pawns. (43.¤xg7? ¦e7 44.¦xe7 
¢xe7 45.¤f5+ ¢f7= Nakamura correctly 
thought this was a draw.);
41...¦a1! was another drawing move. 
42.¤xh5 ¦b8! 43.¤f4 a4 44.¤xe2 
a3 and Black’s far-advanced a-pawn 
guarantees a draw. 
42.hxg5 fxg5 43.¤xh5 Now White is 
winning and Black doesn’t get any more 
chances. 
43...¦e5 44.g4 White stabilises the position 
and turns his attention to the a5–pawn. 
44...¢e8 45.¤g7+ ¢f8 46.¤f5 ¦a2 
47.¦a8+ ¢f7 48.¤d6+ ¢e6 49.¤c4 
¦b5 50.¦xa5 ¦bxa5 51.¤xa5 ¢d5 
52.¢e3 Next the pawn on e2 will fall and 
Firouzja resigned. 
1–0
 
Some of these mistakes can be excused 
because of the extremely complex lines 
the players had to navigate, but these 
complexities require so much energy 
and focus that the players are simply not 
capable of maintaining those for the whole 
duration of the game, thus leading to drops 
in concentration and mistakes.
Nakamura was content that he was in a 
chance to win the tournament until the last 
round. It was good news for his followers 
and it made for good content. His post-game 
recaps were very informative, especially if 
one could read between the lines. It was 
good for the chess world to have Nakamura 
in the Candidates. It will be good to have 
the Nakamura in the Candidates again, but 
whether that will happen, it remains to be 
seen. Two years is a long time.

AN
EXCEPTIONAL
ACHIEVEMENT!
The winner is always deserved, but to 
expect the youngest player to ever qualify 
for a World Championship match to show 
such stability in a tournament like the 
Candidates is exceptional.
In the above analysis we noted that all the 
three players who shared second place 
had their ups and downs. Gukesh didn’t 
have them. In fact, Gukesh had only 
one inferior position, against Caruana 
in round four, which he defended 
confidently. In the game he lost, to 
Firouzja, he was pressing for a win and 
only blundered in severe time trouble. 
In all the other games he was either 
pressing himself or had no problems.
While an elite grandmaster, Gukesh is still 
only 17! To show such a high level in such 
an important event is even frightening: 
imagine the heights he could reach in the 
next years!
Gukesh 
started 
the 
tournament 
by 
introducing an imaginative idea as early as 
move nine in the Tarrasch Defence. Vidit 
reacted well and the game was drawn in 
21 moves by repetition. The tone for the 
tournament was set in round two in the 
game against Praggnanandhaa. We saw the 
opening of that game above and here we 
will see the remainder:

16.e5 f6 The position is very difficult 
to play for both sides. Objectively it is 
balanced and the result is decided by the 
players’ calculation abilities. 
17.c2?! 
This 
allows 
Black 
to 
obtain an advantage with a positional 
queen sacrifice. 
17.fe1 kept the balance. The last piece is 
included in the battle and after something

19.xf6+ xf6 20.xd5 White has good 
compensation for the two pawns as his 
pieces are better coordinated;
17.g5!? was another move that was 
possible. After 17...e8 18.d7 c6 
the position looks just too random and 
impossible to calculate, which translates 
to 0.00 in engine−talk. 
17...c6?! Gukesh solidifies the d5-pawn, 
but allows White to take on f5 and to 
continue to muddy the waters.

17...c5! threatening ...d4 was strong. 
After 18.xd5 xd5 19.xd5 xd5 
20.d1 xe6! is a powerful queen 
sacrifice. 21.xd8 axd8 Black has two

Praggnanandhaa rushes. It was better to 
include the rook in the game with 19.fe1. 
19...c8 Gukesh improves the position 
of the bishop, which became useless 
after ...c6. 
The exchange sacrifice 19...xf7! was 
quite good for Black. 20.exf7+ xf7 
21.e2 e8 with ...c8 next and Black 
is much better. 
20.fe1 b7 Now it’s time for the knight 
to join the game, but again the exchange 
sacrifice on f7 gave Black an advantage. 
21.g5?! 
After 
a 
long 
thought 
Praggnanandhaa decides against a sacrifice 
on d5, but in fact both sacrifices on d5 were 
quite promising for him. Admittedly, the 
lines are hair−raising, so it’s hard to blame 
him for failing to navigate them. 
21.xd5!? cxd5 22.xd5 White has a pawn 
for a rook, but the compensation is present 
as Black’s forces are not coordinated, unlike 
White’s. 22...xe6!? (22...xf7!? 23.exf7+ 
xf7 24.e5 d8 now it’s "only" a 
piece, but White has compensation in this 
completely unclear position.) 23.h6+ 
h8 24.xe6 xa3!? another crazy shot, 
though not the only move. 25.c7! xe6 
26.xe6 b4 everything is hanging: the 
rook on e1, the knight on h6, the rook on 
f8, the knight on b7! 27.d1 and eventually 
it should peter out to a draw;
21.xd5!? cxd5 22.xd5 xf7.
a) 22...xd5?! is good for White after 
23.xd5 d6 24.g4 xf7 25.exf7+ 
xf7 26.e4! b8 27.f4 when White 
is a rook down, but has a tremendous 
initiative that will result in getting some 
material back; 
b) or the insane 22...b4 23.d2! (23.
axb4? xe6 wins for Black.) 23...xd2 
24.xd2 a7 25.g4! and Black has enough 
compensation for the piece;
23.exf7+ xf7 24.e5 f8 25.g5! d7 
26.xf6 gxf6 27.f4 and the position 
remains unclear. 
21...a7?! Missing a very complicated chance. 
21...c5 activating the knight and 
targeting the e6-pawn was better, but the 
lines are still very irrational. 22.xf6 
xe6! (22...xf6 is possible, where both 
sides have to come up with 23.xd5! 
cxd5 24.xd5 xe6! 25.xc5 xf7 
26.xe6! ac8 resulting in an equal 
position.) 23.h6+! h8! (23...gxh6? 
24.xe6 xe6 25.xe6+ f7 26.g4+ 
g6 27.xg6+ hxg6 28.xe7 and in a 
surprising twist, White is up in material 
with a winning position.) 24.xe7! 
the queen sacrifice is the best chance. 
(24.xg7+ 
xg7 
25.xe6 
xe6! 
26.xe6 h8 and White’s attack has 
run out of steam.) 24...xe7! and not 
accepting it is Black’s best! (24...xf5 
25.xc5 g6 26.xf5 xf5 27.xf8 
xf8 is an unclear mess.) 25.e5 a7 
the mess goes on, but the knight on h6 is 
trapped and Black still has the big central 
pawn mass, giving him the advantage.

An impressive game between the two 
Indian prodigies.
Gukesh showed better nerves and 
calculation in an extremely sharp and 
irrational game. The early win set the 
course for Gukesh and in the next round, 
he masterfully outplayed Nepomniachtchi 
from an equal queenless position after 
the opening. He missed an excellent 
opportunity to inflict the first defeat on 
the previous Challenger.

White carefully nurtured his advantage 
to a winning one, but in order to win he 
had to see the tactical solution. 
30.d1? Gukesh missed the only chance. 
30.a4! was the winning idea. After 30...
bxa4 31.c4 the threat is f5. 31...d8 
and here 32.b4! is the hidden tactic 
that wins for White, though he had a 
sensible alternative in 32.a1, keeping 
the big advantage. The point of the 
move is that 32...axb3? 33.xb3 wins 
on the spot thanks to the threat of 
xd8 and c7, winning a piece, while 
33...a8 34.a4 is another problem

The next game with the black pieces 
against Caruana was the only one in the 
whole tournament where Gukesh was on 
the defencive. He showed himself to be 
very resilient and defended confidently.
The game against Abasov showed the 
strength of Gukesh’s character. He 
outplayed Abasov and was winning, 
but in time trouble before the first 
time control, he lost all the advantage. 
Through sheer will and determination, 
he kept on playing and managed to 
win the game for a second time, this 
time converting in 87 moves after his 
opponent missed the last drawing chance 
on move 83.
The only game Gukesh lost was against 
Firouzja in round seven. It was a tense 
game where Gukesh took advantage of 
Firouzja’s reckless play. Playing for a win 
he sacrificed a piece, but time trouble was 
again his main problem. With only seconds 
left he made the losing mistake on move 36 
and was mated.
What happened after the game was more 
important than the loss itself. As Gukesh 
said after the tournament, he felt “at his 
best” after this loss! How many players 
could say that after a devastating loss in 
a Candidates tournament which knocked 
him off the first place? Speaking about the 
strength of character!
Gukesh continued unperturbed and in the 
next round outplayed Vidit with the black 
pieces to return to +2.
A series of three draws followed, against 
Praggnanandhaa, 
Nepomniachtchi 
and 
Caruana, all of them balanced games 
without chances for more.
The second win against Abasov was 
similar to the first one. With willpower 
and determination Gukesh pushed hard 
and outplayed his opponent from an equal 
endgame, this time with the black pieces.
The decisive game for the tournament 
victory was in the penultimate round.
 Gukesh D - Alireza Firouzja 
Candidates Toronto (13), 20.04.2024
1.e4 e5 Firouzja wasn’t very successful 
with the Sicilian, losing both games, so 
in this game sticks to the safest choice of 
the Berlin. 
2.f3 c6 3.b5 f6 4.d3 Only 
Nepomniachtchi went for the endgame and 
won against Vidit. Gukesh prefers to keep 
the queens on the board for the time being. 
4...c5 5.0-0 Nakamura played 5.c3 
against Vidit, in order to avoid Black’s next. 
On the other hand, playing 5.c3 allows the 
plans with ...d5, so both moves have their 
pros and cons.

11.c4 a7 This is the point of the move 
10...a5 − the bishop gets a square to remain 
on the more active g1-a7 diagonal.

Black

14.c2 White covers the d3-square. 
The importance of the d3-square is seen 
after 14.f5 xf5 15.xf5 dxe4 16.dxe4 
d3! and the queen attacks both the e4-
pawn and targets the c3-pawn after 17.e1 
a4! 18.d1 a3 with initiative for Black. 
14...g6 Black stops f5. 
15.e1 A standard move, though it’s clear 
that White doesn’t have any active options 
because of Black’s pawn centre. 
15...e6 Black is developed now and ready 
for an advance with ...d4 or ...a4-a3. He 
also has options to play on the kingside by 
removing the knight from f6 and expanding 
with ...f5. 
16.exd5 Gukesh decides to release the 
tension in order to stop Black’s ideas on 
both sides. 
16...cxd5 17.h3 Controlling the g4-square, 
thus allowing the knight from e3 to drop 
back to f1. 
17...e8 Black prepares the central advance 
...e4, so he places the rook on the e−file. 
18.a4 e4 19.dxe4 dxe4 20.e2 e7 
21.f1 White would like to play e3 in 
order to exchange the strong bishop on a7. 
21...c7 A good prophylactic move, 
intending to meet e3 with ...c4. 
22.b3 To illustrate: 22.e3?! c4! and 
the queen is short of squares, for example 
23.c2? b5 24.b3 xf1 25.xf1 a4 
loses a piece;
22.b5 was a possible alternative to the 
game move, preventing ...c4 but at the 
same time discouraging ...a4, which can be 
met by c4.

Black takes space on the queenside and 
can use the a−pawn to damage White’s 
queenside structure with a further ...a3. 
23.xe6 23.xa4? loses to 23...c4 
24.c2 xf1 25.xf1 b8 and suddenly 
the attack on the kingside cannot be 
defended against: 26.g3 h5 when even 
the rook from a8 can join the attack via the 
fifth rank. 
23...xe6 24.e3 White managed to 
achieve the idea to neutralise the bishop 
on a7. 
24...a3 Black establishes a pawn on a3 
which if left alive can become a strong 
pawn in an endgame. 
25.c4 White has a pawn majority on the 
queenside, so he sets it moving forward. 
25...h5 Black tries to do the same on 
the kingside. 
26.g3 This takes control of the f4-square.

and it was a good alternative. 26...f4

26...c5 26...axb2 27.xb2 gives White 
play on the b−file as compensation for the 
isolated pawns on a2 and c4. 
27.b3 Gukesh avoids the damage to his 
structure after ...axb2. 
27...f5 Black activates the kingside 
majority. Now White needs to be careful 
so as not to end up with a weak king 
after a possible opening of the kingside 
after ...f4. 
28.xc5

29.ad1 
White’s 
counterplay is based on control of the d−file 
and the strong outpost on d5. 
29...f8 The immediate 29...f4 was 
possible. After 30.g4 f6 31.e2 White 
defends successfully and will continue with 
d5 next. 
30.d5 Gukesh keeps more tension in 
the position. 
30.d2 f4 31.d5 would have forced the 
exchange of queens, when the danger of a 
kingside attack evaporates. 
30...e7 31.f4! This move allows Black 
a protected passed pawn on e4, but that 
pawn is blockaded on the e3-square. 
More importantly, now the f−file cannot 
be opened and this reduces the danger 
to the white king. If Black is to continue 
his kingside play he must try to open the 
g−file now. 
31...f6 32.d2 g5 Black is consistent 
with his kingside play. 
32...e3!? was an interesting tactical idea, 
freeing the e4-square for the knight. 
33.d3 e8 34.xe3 c5 35.d3 looks 
dangerous for White, as he is pinned on the 
g1-a7 diagonal, but in fact Black cannot 
increase the pressure. 
33.e3 The knight is ideal on e3, 
blockading the passed pawn and targeting 
the d5-outpost and the pawn on f5. 
33.fxg5?! while possible, it gives Black too 
much free play after 33...d7 
33...gxf4 34.gxf4 f7 35.h2 35.xf5? 
h5! wins for Black, who crashes through 
with the attack after ...g6 or ...xf4. 
35...h5 36.f2 White’s kingside is safe 
and the position continues to be balanced. 
36...g6 37.d5 g7 38.ed1 White 
covered his kingside and now has threats 
of his own along the d−file, intending d7. 
38...h6 The only move for Black, freeing 
the path for the queen to the h5-square. 
39.g1 The players now repeat moves in 
order to reach the time control. 
39.d6!? is a constructive idea for White, 
who would favour an exchange of one pair 
of rooks, which would decrease Black’s 
attacking potential. 39...e6 40.g1+ 
h8 the position remains equal, but also 
quite tense.; 39.d7 h5 40.g2 g6 
41.f2 h6 is a repetition. 
39...g6 40.gd1 h6 41.g1 g6 
42.h4! The decisive moment in the 
tournament. After spending 15 minutes, 
Gukesh decides to continue the game 
in spite of having no advantage and the 
position remaining balanced. This decision 
reminds me of Ding Liren’s famous 
46...g6 in the last game of the tie−break in 
the World Championship match in Astana.

45.h6! was very strong. Black can 
barely move. The following is a nice 
illustration of the helplessness of Black’s 
position: 45...e7 46.e2 f7 47.d2 
e7 (47...e8 48.g5 g8 49.d8! and 
the endgame is winning for White as the 
white king becomes a strong piece on the 
queenside.) 48.c3 f7 49.b4 and White 
activates his queenside majority. 
45...g6? Here comes the second chance. 
It’s a decision that is hard to understand, 
as White actively sought exchanges, 
since in the endgame his active king 
is the decisive factor and here we see 
Firouzja voluntarily giving Gukesh what 
he wanted. 
45...e6! was the only move for Black to 
save the game. 46.xf5 g7 the threats 
along the g−file and the a1-h8 diagonal 
are dangerous, so White must exchange 
queens. 47.e5 xe5 48.xe5 (or 48.fxe5 
f8+ 49.e1 f3 with compensation for 
the pawn, quite sufficient for equality.) 
48...xf4 49.xe4 xh3+ and the 
endgame is a draw.

The win was a result of Gukesh’s courageous 
decision on move 42 to continue the game. 
His courage was rewarded and this win made 
him the sole leader before the last round.
The last round games went exactly as he 
would have liked. He controlled his own 
game, not allowing any chance to Nakamura 
thanks to the excellent opening preparation 
(see the game above) while the roller−coaster 
game between Caruana and Nepomniachtchi 
eventually ended in a draw, making Gukesh 
the winner of the Candidates tournament.
A historic feat for the 17−year−old, a record 
that it’s hard to see being broken any time 
soon. To put things into perspective, Magnus 
Carlsen was 17 in 2007 and most of 2008 
(being born at the end of November), but 
he was very far from winning a Candidates 
tournament at that age.
A NEW ERA 
With Gukesh’s triumph, we can say 
that the new era of the next generation 
is already here. Gukesh’s success will 
motivate his peers to work even harder 
and achieve new heights. They will keep 
pushing each other to new heights and as 
things look now, only the sky is the limit 
for them. 
Ten years after Anand’s last World 
Championship match India got another 
World 
Championship 
contender. 
Will he manage to dethrone the so 
far unimpressive Ding Liren? It’s 
impossible to say, as Ding will be 
ready for the match and his level will 
improve, but who would bet against the 
young star with his meteoric rise?

CHINESE
DOMINATION
IN THE WOMEN’S
CANDIDATES

FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
THE WOMEN’S CANDIDATES 
WAS HELD SIDE-BY-SIDE 
WITH THE OPEN EVENT

05/144
   | BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE
304
Unlike their colleagues, who had a 
tournament which was decided in the 
last moments of the last round, the 
women’s event had a different dynamic.
For the first time ever, the Women’s Candidates 
was held side-by-side with the Open event. 
This was done deliberately, to boost women’s 
chess, in light of FIDE’s long-term ambitions.
The eventual winner of the Women’s 
Candidates in Toronto, Tan Zhongyi, started 
with two wins and never relinquished the lead. 
Her closest competitor was her compatriot 
Lei Tingjie, who - after a slow start - won 
three games in a row in the middle of the 
tournament, including the direct duel, but 
eventually couldn’t keep the pace.
The games were equally complex in the 
women event and with the women being 
lower rated by some 150-200 rating points, 
the mistakes they made were perhaps more 
easily understood.
Let’s see now how each player performed.
MISSED OPPORTUNITIES 
Muzychuk finished second (behind winner 
Goryachkina) in the last Candidates 
tournament that was held in this format. In 
2019 she had a slow start but then picked up 
the pace, won several games and finished a 
full point ahead of the third-placed Lagno 
and Tan Zhongyi.
In Toronto, Muzychuk was the player 
with the most missed wins.
She started slowly again, losing a 
harmless endgame in round two to 
Goryachkina because of bad time 
management: she spent way too much 
time in a relatively simple endgame, 
eventually blundering.
Then, incredible things started to happen.
Muzychuk was winning in the next round 
against Lagno. The win was very hard to 
find in a position with only queen and 
rook for each side where Muzychuk had 
to hunt down her opponent’s king. She 
couldn’t handle the complexity of the 
variations and the game was drawn.
In the next round, Muzychuk obtained 
a winning rook endgame against Lei 
Tingjie which eventually led to a 
position with rook against two pawns. 
The winning method in such positions 
is known, but she missed it.

(57.¢g5? f4 is a draw.) 57...¢h3 (or 
57...¢h2 58.¢h4 ¢g2 59.¦f7 and both 
pawns are lost.) 58.¢g5! again walking 
over to the other side. After ¢f4 the

59...¢g1! was easier, as 60.¢f3 ¢h1! 
forces a stalemate or the exchange of 
all material. 
60.¢f3 g1¤+ This is also a draw and the 
players agreed to it on move 75. 
½–½
 
After that Muzychuk outplayed Vaishali 
with the black pieces, but again the win 
was very complicated and Vaishali erected 
a fortress in a double-rook endgame.
After so many missed wins Muzychuk 
played badly against Tan Zhongyi and 
was completely lost when her opponent 
gave her an unexpected chance by 
misplaying the mating attack. Alas, 
Muzychuk missed the drawing chance 
and lost.
There were more missed wins for 
Muzychuk. In round 11 she blundered 
into a perpetual check in a position 
where she was two pieces up and her 
opponent only had a queen – she had to 
return one piece to win, but she allowed 
a perpetual instead.
With so many missed wins it’s 
impossible to have a good tournament. If 
a player cannot handle the complexities 
of the calculations that the winning 
lines require, that means that either the 
level of the player is not sufficient, or 
the player is not in good form. With 
Muzychuk, it was definitely the latter. 
She fought the best that she could, but 
when things don’t go one’s way, it’s 
very hard to change the momentum.
A very disappointing result for Muzychuk, 
who must have hoped for a similar 
performance as in 2019, but this time it 
didn’t work out.
A SOLID DEBUT
The youngest participant had a decent 
event. She was her usual, solid, self, 
playing positional chess and trying 
to play on technique. However, at this 
level, her usually dependent technique 
was misfiring.
The only game where it finished the 
job was in her only win in the event, 
against Koneru in round four. It was 
Salimova’s best game, where she 
outplayed the rating favourite after a 
wobbly opening.
In her games against Tan, she held an 
inferior endgame with the black pieces, 
but missed a straight-forward win with 
the white. She should have saved the 
inferior endgame against Goryachkina 
in round six while probably the biggest 
blunder of the tournament was in her 
game against Muzychuk, where both 
players miscalculated a transposition to 
a pawn endgame.

The position was a draw for a long time,

54...¢f7 The game continued until 
move 120, but there was no more 
excitement. 
½–½
 
The hardest loss to take was against 
Vaishali in round 10 when Salimova 
expertly outplayed her opponent, but 
managed to lose from a position where 
Vaishali could only move with her king 
(see the game below).
When it came to tactical fights, Salimova 
wasn’t up to her task. The piece sacrifice 
that Vaishali essayed in their first game 
should have led to a draw, but Salimova 
didn’t find the way.
Another problem for Salimova were 
the openings, or perhaps her memory 
of the opening preparation. It appeared 
that in almost every game she misplayed 
them early on. With the black pieces she 
expanded her repertoire, adding the Petroff, 
the Philidor and the Ruy Lopez to her Caro-
Kann and they served her well, though she 
wasn’t always precise in the opening. With 
White she stuck to her favourite Catalan, 
but found her opponents well prepared.
The tournament was a learning experience 
for Salimova. If she can raise the level of her 
calculations and improve her openings, her 
technique should catch up and then she would 
become much more competitive at elite level.
A SLOW START AND A
DISAPPOINTING FINISH
Lagno was one of the pre-tournament 
favourites. She started the tournament with 
five draws, but like Muzychuk, she had 
a lot of missed winning chances in those 
games. True, she saved a lost game against 
Muzychuk, but she missed wins (and not 
too complicated at that) against Koneru, 
Tan Zhongyi and Lei Tingjie.

White is easily winning with her passed pawns 
and complete domination. The only slight 
thing that needs care is the advance of the 
black h-pawn, but even that is easily dealt with. 
49.£f3 Possible, but there was a simpler way. 
49.¦b6 freeing the path of the a-pawn 
was as simple as it can get. After 49...h4 
50.¥e5 £f5 51.£d4 White moves away 
from the pin and the a-pawn continues to 
march forward. 
49...£g6 50.¦a8 50.¥e5 was another simple 
solution. After 50...g4 (50...¥xd6 51.¦xd6 
¦xd6 52.£a8+ leads to mate.) 51.£g3 
White keeps everything under control. 
50...¦xa8 51.£xa8 h4 52.¥e5?? The 
fatal mistake. 
White missed two easy chances and here 
she had to give up her d6–pawn with 
52.¥f2 £xd6+ 53.¢h1 which still results 
in an easy win as the white king is safe and 
the a-pawn will soon decide the game. 
52...£e6! Now White loses the d6–pawn 
under much worse circumstances - the 
game is a draw. 
53.£e4 ¥xd6 54.£a8+ ¢h7 55.¥xd6

½–½
 
Lagno won her first game in the next 
round against Vaishali, but what was true 
for Muzychuk it was also true for Lagno – 
with too many missed winning chances it’s 
impossible to have a good tournament.
She continued to draw her games, this time 
without any winning chances, staying on +1 
and in contention. Her hopes were extinguished 
in round 11 when she first missed a win and 
then a draw against Tan Zhongyi.
The tournament finished on a sour note for 
Lagno as in the last round she misplayed a 
promising attack against Vaishali and lost again.
Lagno was another player who was not in 
her best form. She kept herself in the top 
part of the table thanks to her class, but by 
the end of the event, with fatigue setting in, 
she dropped her level and lost two games 
and ended up with a negative score.
What they say about football is applicable to 
chess, too. If you don’t score, you concede. 
Lagno suffered that fate in Toronto.
A GOOD START 
ISN’T GOOD ENOUGH 
Goryachkina (7 out of 14)

The other pre-tournament favourite finished 
on 50 percent.
This doesn’t tell the whole story of 
Goryachkina’s tournament. In fact, she 
started well, beating Muzychuk in round 
two and Salimova in round six, to emerge 
among the leaders. She was playing in her 
usual technical style, squeezing out wins 
in endgames and seemed well on course to 
challenge for first place.
The turning point in the tournament for 
Goryachkina were the games in rounds 
nine and 10.
In round nine she was caught out in 
the opening by Muzychuk. However, 
Goryachkina knew the line well and 
navigated it correctly to an equal endgame. 
Then Muzychuk misplayed it and gave her 
opponent a unique opportunity.

Muzychuk took some risks by giving up 
her bishop for a couple of pawns, but it 
wasn’t a very-well calculated risk because 
if anybody, it is only Black who can play 
for a win, in spite of the position being 
objectively a draw. 
33.¦c7? A serious mistake. White makes 
a panicky move and rushes to pick up 
the c-pawns. 
33.a4 would have drawn the game. 
33...¦a8? 
Tournaments 
are 
often 
decided in a single moment. This one 
was such for Goryachkina. 
33...¤d8! was the winning move. It’s 
natural enough, defending the c6–pawn, 
so it’s hard to say why she didn’t play 
it. Perhaps she didn’t believe there were 
chances left in the position? 34.¦c8 ¤e6 
35.¦xf8+ (35.¦xc6 ¢f7 and the king 
comes to e7 and d6 when Black will start 
to collect White’s weak pawns.) 35...¢xf8 
36.a4 ¢e7 and the king will take care of 
the a-pawn while the knight can defend 
the kingside. 
34.¦xc6 ¢g7 35.¦xc5 And the game was 
drawn in 45 moves. 
½–½
 
As if to punish Goryachkina, Fate again 
gave her a knight against her opponent’s 
pawns in the next round against Lei Tingjie. 
Goryachkina missed the draw on move 61 
and lost the game.
Now on only +1, Goryachkina had to 
play for a win with the black pieces in the 
next round against Vaishali. She chose the 
Sicilian, not her usual choice, and wasn’t 
up to date with the latest developments in 
the Alapin Variation. This landed her in an 
inferior position, but Vaishali was happy 
with a draw and on a couple of occasions 
repeated the moves. Goryachkina kept 
avoiding the draw but that was to her 
detriment and she ended up lost. Then 
she took advantage of Vaishali’s mistakes 
and when the game was about to end in a 
draw, she blundered horribly on move 64 
and lost again.
She ended the tournament with three 
draws (she was lost against Koneru 
in round 12 and misplayed an almost 
winning position against Salimova in 
round 14) and a 50 percent score.

BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 309
Goryachkina wasn’t in her best form, but 
in spite of that she was in contention for 
most of the tournament. It was a definite 
disappointment for her, though in view of 
the Chinese domination it would have been 
very hard even she played better and took 
all her chances.
FULL-SPEED REVERSE
THEN FULL-SPEED
AHEAD
The winner of the Grand Swiss had an 
unreal tournament. Vaishali made only 
three draws and had a streak of four losses 
in a row followed by five wins in a row!
After the draw in the first round, she 
was outplayed from a simple position by 
eventual winner Tan Zhongyi (see below 
for the game). In round three she beat 
Salimova in her trademark tactical style.
Then the streaks began.
She started to lose games in horrible fashion. 
She was outplayed both positionally and 
tactically, missed all her chances even when 
she had them, like in the game with Koneru 
where she was completely lost out of the 
opening, then fought back to a dead draw, 
but still lost. The worst was the 21-move 
loss with the white pieces to Tan Zhongyi 
(see below).
The lucky break came in round 10.

immobilising White’s rook. Black won 
in 88 moves. 
0–1
 
After this win Vaishali couldn’t be 
stopped. In the remaining four rounds 
she beat Goryachkina, Muzychuk, Lei 
Tingjie and Lagno.
The rise from dead last to shared second 
with five consecutive wins is one of the 
greatest comebacks in chess history. 
Vaishali could pull it off thanks to her 
resilience and tactical astuteness, as she 
was usually better attuned to the tactical 
possibilities hidden in the positions. Her 
youth was also a contributing factor as 
fatigue didn’t seem to affect her as much.
Another 
surprising 
matter 
is 
the 
difference in the level of play during her 
losing and winning streaks, from very 
bad to very good within such a short 
period of time. What exactly clicked 
for her, how did the lucky break against 
Salimova change things? These secrets of 
chess psychology are always hidden from 
the public eye and the players are never 
eager to talk about them.
A young player can often feel crushed after 
heavy losses. The fact that Vaishali not only 
overcame the losses, but also turned them 
into wins, speaks a lot about her character 
and resilience. She comes out of the Toronto 
Candidates as one of the winners, with a 
firm belief that the future can only bring 
her better results and a way forward.
A STEP BEHIND 
In spite of finishing with only +1 and a 
shared second, Lei Tingjie was the only 
real competitor to the winner Tan Zhongyi 
throughout the event. 
Lei Tingjie (7.5 out of 14)

BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE | 311
Lei Tingjie started by losing to Tan 
Zhongyi in round one with the white pieces. 
This gave a big confidence boost to Tan 
Zhongyi, while Lei needed time to get back 
into the tournament. She made four draws 
before she started winning games.
She won three games in a row, against 
Koneru, Vaishali and, most importantly, 
against Tan Zhongyi.

Tan Zhongyi wanted to achieve a position 
similar to her game against Vaishali. 
3...c5 4.e3 ¤c6 5.¤bd2 ¥g4 One of the

A characteristic moment. Tan Zhongyi 
was a full point ahead of Lei Tingjie and 
it made infinitely more sense to take the 
draw with the tournament situation into 
consideration: she keeps the lead and 
keeps at bay a dangerous opponent who 
is on a roll. But Tan Zhongyi shows a 
fighting spirit and decides to continue the 
game in a position where she is in fact at 
a disadvantage.

of the b-file, though the immediate 21...b4

round 12. After that miss she seemed to drop 
psychologically and she went on to lose the 
last two games to Vaishali and Koneru, both of 
whom caught her on 7.5 points.
Worth mentioning is her game against 
Koneru, which was a spoilt masterpiece.

The sharp Saemisch Variation of the 
Nimzo-Indian led to a murky position. As 
her second later revealed, Lei Tingjie was 
still in her preparation here. 
22.¦h7! Allowing her queen to be trapped! 
22...¤b8 23.£xa5!! Amazing concept. 
White will have only a piece for the queen, 
but Black’s lack of coordination give White 
excellent compensation.

otherwise ¦b7 wins. 
25.¦b7+ ¢d8 26.¤xf7+? Lei Tingjie

and this was indicated by Radjabov. It’s a 
fascinating position where White presses 
with a only a bishop for queen and a pawn! 
26...¢c8 27.¤d6+ £xd6 28.exd6 ¢xb7

Eventually Koneru won in 62 moves.

Lei Tingjie had a very good event, spoilt only 
by the two losses at the end, when the fight 
for first place was practically decided. She will 
have to wait for two more years to try to get 
another match for the title, but if she manages 
to keep improving and have a strong second 
like Radjabov, she has every chance to do so.
TWO HALVES 
Koneru had a tournament of two halves. She 
was horrible in the first, losing two games and 
drawing the rest, while she had a very good 
second half, winning three games without a loss.
While she finished tied for second, Koneru 
was never in contention for the top spots. 
Her play in the first half was listless and 
in the games she lost she was outplayed 
by Salimova and committed a blunder in a 
drawn endgame against Lei Tingjie.
The turning point for Koneru was the game with 
Vaishali in round eight. It was a strange game: 
Koneru was winning after the opening, a clear 
exchange up on move 16. Then, inexplicably, she 
managed to play so badly to allow Vaishali so 
much that the position was a draw by move 40. 
Then Lady Luck finally smiled on Koneru and 
Vaishali blundered the game away on move 55.
After this win Koneru’s game improved 
tremendously. She raised her level and kept 
control in her games. She ground down 
Salimova in an exemplary technical fashion 
and could have even followed up with 
Koneru (7.5 out of 14)

White is tied on the a-file. Black had a way

decided to repeat moves and draw.

after 25...£xa6 26.¥xd8 £b5– Black should 
win as she wins another pawn thanks to the 
double attack on the pawns on e5 and b2.

After the uneventful draw with Muzychuk 
she beat Lei Tingjie in the last round after 
surviving the opening scare we saw above.
In spite of the strong finish, it’s doubtful that 
Koneru is happy with her performance. She 
must have considered herself capable of fighting 
for first place, whereas she spent the whole 
event playing catch-up without any chances.
THE
STRONGEST
CANDIDATE
Tan Zhongyi dominated the event. She 
was the best fighter and even though she 
also had her ups and downs, she was 
most adept at smoothing them over.
She started the event by beating her 
compatriot Lei Tingjie with the black 
pieces and followed it up with a smooth 
win over Vaishali.

The position is completely equal and 
seemingly dull. It’s hard to imagine 
any side stirring up trouble, though 
generally speaking White should try to 
play in the centre (the e5–outpost) and 
kingside while Black should organise 
a minority attack on the queenside. 
With her last move White prepares the 
transfer of the awkward knight on c3 to 
the ideal square on d3. 
13...£c7 14.¤a2 The knight will come to

A strange move. The knight looks 
good, but it’s largely ineffective on 
b3. This decision shows us the depth 
of Tan Zhongyi’s opening choice. By 
choosing a dull position she hoped to 
dull Vaishali’s tactical talent. Lo and 
behold, Vaishali makes a bad positional 
decision. She also went for a position 
with a clear plan for her, a plan which 
is not affected by exchanges of pieces. 
This meant that she calmly proceeded 
to build up her kingside play while she 
hoped that Vaishali won’t be able to 
balance her own play on the queenside 
with the need to keep an eye on the 
kingside. As we shall see, Tan Zhongyi’s 
game plan worked to perfection. 
18.¦ad1 a5 19.¤d3 a4 20.¤fe5 Even 
objectively White is somewhat better 
already. More importantly, though, her 
plan is easy and the moves are natural, 
unlike Black’s. 
20...¤a5 Vaishali realises the mistake and 
reroutes the knight to c4, having wasted 
time beforehand. 
21.f3 ¤d6 22.¤f4 ¤ac4 23.¤ed3 
White avoided the exchange of knights 
as she can make better use of her own 
- the knight on d3 safely guards the 
queenside (the pawn on b2) while the 
knight on f4 can be used in the attack. 
The knight on f4 also keeps an eye on 
the e6–pawn, thus discouraging play in 
the centre with ...f6. 
23...¦fe8 24.£f2 ¦e7 25.¦e2 ¦ce8 
26.¦de1 White prophylactically doubled 
the rooks on the e-file to stop ...f6 and ...e5. 
26...b6 This move controls the c5–
square, but does nothing to interfere with 
White’s kingside play. The move also 
shows the lack of ideas Black suffers 
from in this position. 
After 26...£d8 27.g4 the engine 
proposes 27...¢h8 28.h4 g6 as a better 
defence. Still, it looks very shaky 
after 29.£g3 (29.h5?! g5! closes the 
kingside.) 29...h6 30.¦h2 when White 
can prepare for a pawn push on the 
kingside at some point while Black can 
only wait.

Black wants to use the d6–square for the 
queen to defend the pawn on e6 and then 
play ...f6 and ...e5, but this is too slow. 
27...£d7 was a faster and better way to 
do it. Black is still fine after this move. 
A sample line is 28.£g3 f6 29.h4 e5! 
30.¤xd5 ¦e6 and Black will have the 
safer king once the game opens, giving her 
good compensation. 
28.£h4 £d6 29.¤h5 f6 30.g5 Now Black 
doesn’t have time for ...e5 as White’s play 
on the kingside is faster. 
30...f5? A positional capitulation. 
30...fxg5 was the only move to somehow 
stay in the game. 31.£xg5 ¦f7 32.f4 
looks grim for Black, but at least she’s 
not immediately lost. 
31.¦g2 Introducing ¤f6 ideas. 
31...¢h8 32.¤df4 The attack just crashes 
through. White’s ideas are ¤f6 or ¤g6. 
32...e5 A desperate attempt. 
33.¤f6! gxf6 34.¤g6+ White takes on 
e7 next, opens the g-file and wins with a 
direct attack. 
1–0
 
An easy win on the surface, but the 
foundation was set by the very shrewd choice 
of opening variation and the subsequent 
pawn structure, specially tailored to her 
young opponent’s inexperience.
This win put Tan Zhongyi in the early lead 
with 2/2.
Another very important game for Tan 
Zhongyi’s tournament was the comeback 
win against the same opponent in the 
second half of the tournament. Before that 
game Tan Zhongyi lost to Lei Tingjie and 
lost the sole lead, so it was crucial for her 
to regain her confidence.

Vaishali self-destructed in this game, but to 
win a tournament one must have some luck.
Tan Zhongyi had her share of saved lost 
positions, against Lagno (see above) 
and against Salimova in round 11, but it 
was always her fighting spirit that saw 
her through the difficulties.
Tan Zhongyi was the strongest player 
in Toronto. Her courageous decision 
to continue the game against Lei 
Tingjie when a draw would have been 
the practical decision backfired, but 
she was rewarded for her courage in 
the following games. This courage, 
the fighting spirit, the clever opening 
preparation with both colours and the 
pure chess qualities of her high class 
were the factors that determined Tan 
Zhongyi’s victory.
A former World Champion from 2017, 
now she will get a rematch with Ju 
Wenjun – she lost to her in 2018 with the 
score 5.5-4.5 and will certainly try to do 
better this time.
The results in Toronto showed that the 
Chinese domination in women’s chess 
continues and for the time being, there is 
no indication that things will change.

EMIL SUTOVSKY, FIDE CEO, 
IN HIS WORDS – ON THE CANDIDATES
A TOURNAMENT 
OF FIRSTS
SERIOUSLY, THE CANDIDATES TOURNAMENT 
HAS ALWAYS STOOD APART. FOR MANY, 
THIS IS THE MOST INTERESTING EVENT 
OF THE CHESS BIENNIAL. 
And even in this glorious series of iconic 
tournaments, the competition in Toronto 
turned out to be special.
For the first time, such a young chess player 
became the winner - Gukesh is not even 18 
years old!
For the first time, four players simultaneously 
claimed victory in the last round.
For the first time... yes, there were many firsts.
The tournament was a great success - and 
we also tried to live up to it. We built a 
large fan zone, where grandmasters and 
streamers commented on the games, and 
where participants and fans came together.
We organized side events [exhibitions, 
excursions, the FIDE Torch ceremony...].
We built a system of slots in the auditorium 
to allow everyone in, but not to interfere 
with the players. By the way, all entrance 
tickets were purchased long before the end 
of the tournament - and this in non-chess 
Canada!
But all this is a prelude - as the main things 
happened on the board. And how many 
emotions there were!
Gukesh certainly deserved to win. After the 
tournament, I had a chance to talk to him and 
he made a very pleasant impression. Calm, 
respectful, knows the history of chess well and 
generally enjoys talking and asking questions 
on all topics related to his favourite game.
The game is truly a favourite one - and 
Gukesh devotes all his time to it. He left 
school a long time ago, but the guy is by no 
means limited, he speaks three languages 
- his native Tamil, Telugu and English.
Understands but does not speak Hindi very
well, and knows basic Spanish.
He doesn’t play online, isn’t active on social 
networks, doesn’t use instant messengers.
In general, a modern version of Fischer, but 
with a much more stable psychology.
The 
women’s 
tournament 
was 
also 
exciting, and although Tan’s final victory 
looked very confident, there was tension in 
the tournament right up to the last round. 
In general, the decision to combine both 
candidates seems right.
Returning to the organization of the 
competition, I would like to note the great 
work done by Pavel Tregubov and his team.
And, of course, a necessary factor was the 
financial support of our sponsors and patrons: 
the Scheinberg family and One Hotel Toronto.
Thanks to everyone who followed.
See you soon!

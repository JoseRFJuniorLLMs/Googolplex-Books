Editor’s Foreword
With the advent of electronic tools such as databases and engines,
the chess market has changed considerably. The initial phase of the
game has undergone a re-evaluation, reflected in a very extensive
book and video market, 90% of which consists of works on opening
theory.
One quantity, however, has remained constant – the human
being. We humans do not learn faster and better than before. Hence
any learning material must remain well structured and manageable.
Play 1…d6 Against Everything starts precisely here. Its intent is to
save the reader time and set his mind at ease by taking him through
the least decisive phase of the game.
Let’s be honest: is the opening’s share of our total performance
really so great? Do we not in nearly every game get a second
chance and, depending on the level of play, a third or a fourth?
Understanding fundamental themes in chess, such as dealing with
structures, squares and the many other tactical and strategic
elements of chess, has a far greater impact on overall performance
than does opening theory.
But of course we cannot dispense with theory!
What do club players really need?
Because of the complex analytical material, the demands of a chess
book are very great – grandmasters usually write for players at their
own level. The needs of the broader market recede into the
background. A volume for an opening system rapidly exceeds 1,000
pages – a comprehensiveness that, ultimately, overtaxes even
grandmasters.
But the average reader belongs to the group of club players who
have completely different needs and goals. Even if they exhibit very
different levels of play, the preconditions are similar: advanced age,
a challenging professional life with intensive social involvements, and

many competing leisure interests. All told, there is little free time for
organized chess training.
Effective time management is needed – opening theory should
not constitute the main focus of a club player’s efforts! Play 1…d6
Against Everything provides a good 200 pages of manageable
opening knowledge for a chess player’s everyday routine. Thanks to
the side variations, theory changes only slightly: the constant
reworking and tracking of world-class theory is reduced to a
minimum.
This book is based on opening systems that I have used for
decades at grandmaster level. At club-player level, too, this work
provides a solid foundation for chess progress.

Co-Author’s Foreword
A small, solid and uncommon repertoire
The advantages of a small and solid opening repertoire, which can
be used without excessive study of theoretical variations on every
occasion, should not be underestimated! Since only a few positions
have to be analysed, and these occur quite frequently in practice,
the typical structures, ideas and plans soon become familiar.
Moreover, in the case of the quite rare systems in our d6-repertoire,
the fact that these have not attracted a lot of attention on the part
of our opponents, nor by opening theory, means that the repertoire
lines are considerably undervalued. Looked at objectively, the
Antoshin Variation and the Old Indian may be somewhat inferior in
quality to the usual main openings, but this small disadvantage, after
a certain learning phase, is more than compensated for by a better
understanding of the positions that arise. In our choice of variations
we have given special attention to recommending, where possible,
these formations and typical maneuvers. This facilitates the initial
learning as well as the later application of the variations in
tournament games.
This book
I have often observed how my long-time teammate Jörg Hickl, with
his restrained play in the opening, has made even the strongest
opposition immediately stop and think, even when playing Black!
After one of his typical victories I asked him whether he would be
willing to publish his system in book form – I would be the first
buyer. But Jörg didn’t have the time and suggested I do it myself!
Since then, a good four years of intensive analysis have passed
during which I have updated and rounded out his repertoire. During
this period I used the Antoshin Variation of the Philidor Defense
(1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.♘f3 exd4 5.♘xd4 ♗e7) almost
exclusively against 1.e4, and often used the Old Indian Defense
(1.d4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.c4 ♘bd7 4.♘c3 e5 and …♗e7) against 1.d4,

as well as 1.c4 e5 followed by …d6 – not because we were writing
about these lines but because I wanted to score points and had
come to trust these openings! And so you see that strictly speaking
the repertoire is not 1…d6 against everything, as our book title says
– against flank openings we usually play our reply on move 2. But
the combination with …e7-e5 is maintained also here.
Active counterplay!
After 1…d6 Black at first builds up his game (apparently!) passively,
especially the modest development of the king’s bishop to e7, where
for a time it cannot move and seems very defensive. But as you will
quickly realize, Black, after completing his development, strives for
counterplay with …a7-a6 and …b7-b5. The opening of the center
with …exd4 and the subsequent attack on the flank with …b5-b4
and …c7-c5 is a central feature of our main variation.
Audience
This book was put together primarily for today’s circumstances, a
slim repertoire book for club players with an Elo rating between 1400
and 2200. But it should also offer some interesting suggestions to
players at a higher level. We wanted, with only a few words, to
outline the most important structures, ideas and plans, as well as
our thinking at the board. For this reason I have preferred to make
reference to my own games.
Working with the book
The first reading of the book should aim primarily at understanding
the most important typical middlegame positions. When playing over
the games for the first time you can skip over the departures from
the main line; only on subsequent readings should you give attention
to specific lines and move orders. Always work at a full-size board
and, more and more, make the transition from the critical (!) reading
of this book to your own, independent analysis – this usually results
in the best progress. The numerous variations cited are not to be
memorized, but used as orientation and stimulation for your own
analysis. When you ask, ‘What is the best play for both sides? I will

check this for myself!’ – then you have started on an auspicious path
for increasing your understanding and your playing strength.
Computer – ‘ ’
All variations were checked with the computer and its evaluations
were almost always adopted. The fact that White often has a small
advantage is something to which we should not ascribe too much
importance. This advantage often disappears if White does not find
the optimal build-up or overlooks or underestimates the numerous
possibilities for Black’s counterplay. And this is the rule rather than
the exception!
Opening theory, innovations
In publishing this book we are not looking so much to enrich
opening theory as we are to giving club players a reliable repertoire.
Nevertheless, I have often marked the first new move with the
designation ‘N’. So you can see where the game has left the beaten
path; in most cases this happens quite early in the game, but in a
few instances it occurs surprisingly late.
So as not to overload the text, we refrain from citing the work of
other authors. A list of the sources used can be found in the
bibliography in the back of the book.
Acknowledgements
This book would never have come into existence without the
seminar notes and the decades-long preparation of Jörg Hickl: his
patience, his constant encouragement and his grandmasterly tips
and advice – to say nothing of his duties as editor, which he carried
out in exemplary fashion.
Many thanks also to FM Stephan Buchal, who exhaustively
reviewed and improved the book’s content and expression and
contributed valuable tips on phrasing. Any shortcomings that remain
are mine alone.
So enough of the foreword, it’s time for the moves! I wish you a
fruitful study of our d6-repertoire and much success in your games!

Overview of the d6-repertoire
The central building blocks of our little d6-repertoire are described in
this brief introduction.
Against 1.e4, we will use the Antoshin Variation of the Philidor
Defense, while against 1.d4 our repertoire employs the Old Indian
Defense.
On the way to the Antoshin Variation White often exchanges pawns
early in the center. This is discussed in Chapter 1 – The Endgame
Variation.
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8
In this queenless middlegame Black has good chances for equality –
in practice this means that the better player wins!
We analyze the Antoshin Variation and its sidelines in Chapters 2 and
3:
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.♘f3 exd4 5.♘xd4 ♗e7

Against most systems by White we strive for a setup with …0-0, …
c7-c6, …♖e8, and …♘bd7-e5 (-c5). Black plans …b7-b5, with a
flank attack on White’s center, a motif that occurs repeatedly in our
repertoire.
Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the Old Indian Defense and its sidelines:
1.d4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.c4 ♘bd7 4.♘c3 e5
With this development of the bishop to e7 we arrive at the Old
Indian Defense. Here, too, our goal is the typical counterplay with …

c7-c6, …a7-a6 and …b7-b5, followed by …exd4 and …b5-b4.
Our build-up against the English Opening, which we analyze in
Chapter 6, is similar to the one we use against the Old Indian:
1.c4 e5 2.♘c3 d6 3.g3 f5 4.♗g2 ♘f6 5.d3 ♗e7 6.♘f3 0-0 7.0-0
Here, too, Black’s setup seems rather passive at first, but the second
player often gets a dangerous attack on the kingside with …♕d8-e8-
h5 and a subsequent …f5-f4.
In the seventh and final chapter we briefly discuss the less-frequent
flank openings, against which we mostly recommend the setups
that are familiar to us from the earlier chapters.

4…dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8
There are many white players who cannot resist the temptation to
trade queens, keeping the black king in the middle of the board. We
use the term ‘endgame variation’ only for reasons of space – what
we are actually dealing with here is a queenless middlegame; with
two rooks and four minor pieces, dangerous attacks can still be
organized. The assumption that the black king is unsafe in the
middle of the board seems, at first glance, quite obvious. But in this
chapter we will arm you against the typical white attacks on the
black monarch.
Section 1: 6.♗c4
6.♗c4
The alternatives 6.♗g5, 6.♘f3, and 6.f4 are discussed in Section 2.
The move 6.♗c4 is very unpleasant for Black. How should he
protect his f7-pawn without neglecting his development?
6…♗e6 7.♗xe6 fxe6
At first glance Black’s position looks very unpleasant. His king is in
the middle of the board and his pawn structure is ruined. But the

decisive factor here is the coordination of Black’s pieces and pawns:
1) King safety: after …♗d6 and …♔e7 Black’s king would be hard
to get at. The d6-square is well protected and can be further
reinforced without difficulty. Knight attacks from f5 or d5 are
deterred by the doubled pawn on e6 that we just now censured. And
an opening up of the middle of the board is precluded for the most
part by the doubled pawns.
2) In the ensuing middlegame play, Black’s bad bishop is,
paradoxically, the most valuable minor piece! It bolsters the center
and his king position, and neutralizes the pressure along the d-file
should White double his rooks. Fulfilling all these defensive tasks
gives the black knights and rooks scope for active play.
3) This brings us to another important issue: how do the two
adversaries utilize their rooks? Well, for White this is not a simple
matter, as it is difficult to break through on the d-file. Black, on the
other hand, has a somewhat easier task: he can initiate a pawn
advance with …a7-a6, …b7-b5, and …♖hb8, followed by …♘a5, to
open files on the queenside. This can prove quite effective if White
castles queenside or if the c3-knight cannot be repositioned quickly.
Should White seek to march forward with g2-g3 etc., then Black can
exert pressure along the f-file with his rooks. Then, thanks to his
firm center, he can get good play on the wings!
To summarize: if in the diagrammed position White should prove to
have a small advantage due to his better pawn structure, the play is
nevertheless very rich and complicated.

8.f3
8.♗e3 usually transposes after 8…♗d6 9.f3, but this move order
gives us an opportunity to see how Black should not play: 9…♔e7
10.♘h3 a6 11.♘f2 ♘c6 12.♘d3 h6 13.♘e2 So far everything is
going according to plan.
analysis diagram
In the play that follows, however, Black comes up with the poor idea
of bringing the king to c8 and doubling the rooks on the d-file. Both
decisions make his position worse. The king is perfectly positioned at

e7, and the rooks should be placed on the open or half-open files
that have been created on the wings! 13…♖ad8 14.0-0-0 ♖he8

20.a3  ♗f8?! 21.a4 (21.c4 ) 21…♗d6 22.♘ec1 a5? (this places the
a-pawn on a bad square and forces White to mark the whole chain
c7-b6-a5 as a weakness; 22…♔b7) 23.b5+–
analysis diagram
It is just this that should not have been allowed to happen: the
pawn structure on the queenside is now completely static, and there
is a whole series of weaknesses on this side that will have to be
managed. 1-0 (45) Buchal-Wohlfart, Germany tt 2001/02.
Back to our game.
8…♗d6 9.♘h3 ♘c6
The fact that the white king has remained in the center is less
attractive in view of …♘d4.
10.♗e3 ♔e7 11.0-0-0
Here the king is not completely safe, as Black will march forward on
the queenside. But leaving the king in the center is not altogether
unproblematic for White, either. For example, 11.♘f2 a6 prepares …
♘d4, so that after ♗xd4 and …exd4, ♘b5 cannot follow. 12.♘d3
(12.♔e2 ♘d4+ 13.♗xd4 exd4 14.♘b1 c5 15.g3 g5 16.♘d2 b5 )
12…♘d7 and now:

A) 13.0-0-0 h6 is similar to the game continuation;
B) 13.♔f2!?N is perhaps the most promising try to keep a small
advantage. The king stands better here than on the queenside; e.g.
13…♘d4 14.♖ac1 (14.♗xd4?! exd4 15.♘e2 c5 ) 14…c5 15.♖hd1
♖hc8 16.♖d2 ♔e8 17.♘b1 ♗e7 18.♖cd1 b5 19.b3 ♘c6 20.♘b2
♖c7 21.c3 ♘a5, with a somewhat better position for White,
although the second player would have chances for active play;
C) 13.♔e2 ♘d4+ and the position of White’s king in the center is
shown, thanks to the knight on c6, to be rather uncomfortable; e.g.
14.♔d2 c5 15.♘e2 ♘c6 16.c4 (16.b3 c4! ) 16…b5 17.♖ac1 ♘d4
18.♗f2 (18.b4 ♖hc8!=) 18…b4 when we can see no path to an
advantage for White, as 19.b3 (19.♘xd4 exd4 20.f4 ♔f7=) 19…a5
20.♘b2 ♘b6 leads to black counterplay on the queen’s wing.
11…a6 12.♘f2 b5
The pawn storm against White’s king position is not that promising
in practical play, but most players do not enjoy being on the
defensive. Naturally, White’s position is perfectly in order, so that
every black pawn advance harbors the risk of creating weaknesses
that will become apparent later on.
The alternatives 12…h6, 12…♘h5 and 12…♖hf8 are just as
playable.
13.♘d3 h6 14.♘b1
Redeploying the vulnerable knight. White of course abstains from
making pawn moves that could be used to open files.
14.a3 is just such an unnecessary pawn move, one that is better
omitted: 14…♘d7 15.♗f2 ♖hb8 16.♔b1 ♘a5 17.♘a2 c5, when an
imminent line opening in front of White’s king becomes more and
more probable.
14…♘d7 15.♘d2

15…♘b4
This simplification eases White’s game a bit.
15…♘a5 16.♔b1 c5 looks more dangerous for White, where
something dangerous is brewing in front of his king. Nevertheless,
the position is still level: 17.♘b3 ♘b7  It is instructive to note that
the first player, in view of his time-consuming development (♘g1-
h3-f2) and the protracted redeployment of the c3-knight, has not
even begun to take possession of the open d-file. The position is
very double-edged and there are definite chances for Black to
achieve a good game.
16.♘xb4 ♗xb4 17.♘b3 a5 18.♔b1
Here, in contrast to the variation after 15…♘a5, White has no
difficulty in coordinating his pieces.
18.c3 ♗d6 19.♔b1 ♖a6 20.♗f2 a4 (20…c5?! 21.c4!  would result
in an immobilization that Black should avoid) 21.♘c1 c5 22.♖d2
♘b6 23.♗h4+ ♔d7 24.b3 ♔c6 25.♖hd1 ♗c7 26.♗f2 g5 27.♘d3
axb3 28.axb3 ♖ha8= The c5-pawn is poisoned: 29.♘xc5?? ♖a1+
30.♔c2 ♖8a2+ 31.♔d3 ♖xd1–+
18…♗d6 19.♘a1 c5?!
Better was 19…♖hb8.
20.♖d2?!
The grandmasters trade minor inaccuracies. More precise is 20.c4! .
20…c4 21.♖hd1 ♖a6 22.c3

22…♖c8
Even if Black has something of a space advantage and there is a
pawn lever (…b5-b4xc3) available for opening the position, the
balance of forces is not yet significantly disturbed. The fine line
between ‘pawn storm, with an attack on the king’ and ‘weakening of
the black pawn structure by excessive advances’ is all too easily
transgressed. Here are some sample variations:
A) 22…♖b8 23.♘c2 b4 24.♔a1 ♖c6 25.♗f2 ♖b5 26.♗h4+ g5
27.♗f2 ♘c5= 28.cxb4 ♘a4! (28…axb4?! 29.♘xb4 ) 29.♘a3 ♖xb4
30.♘b1 ♖b7 31.♖c2 ♖c8 32.h4 ♖cb8 33.♖dd2 ♗b4 34.♖e2 ♖c7
35.a3 ♗d6 36.hxg5 hxg5 37.♔a2 ;
B) 22…♖c8 23.♘c2 ♖c7 24.♗f2 b4 25.♘e3 ♗c5 26.♖c1 ♘b6=
This game was played in the context of a team competition and the
players agreed to a draw here, which ensured that Black’s team
reached 4½ points, thereby winning the match. In the final position,
Black already has the more comfortable game.
Conclusion
With the aid of 9…♘c6 Black tempted his opponent to evacuate his
king to the queen’s wing. There, Black has good practical chances by
advancing his pawn phalanx.
Game 2
Julio Becerra Rivero 2547

Robert Hungaski 2461
USA tt 2014
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8 6.♗c4 ♗e6
7.♗xe6 fxe6
8.f3
An obligatory pawn move. It does invite 8…♗c5, but this would
accelerate the development of White’s pieces because of 9.♘a4.
A) 8.♗g5 is harmless, since ♗xf6+ is not a threat. Black builds
up in the usual way with 8…♗d6, after which White’s bishop does
not exert any great effect: 9.f3 ♔e7 10.0-0-0 ♘c6 11.♘ge2 a6,
with play similar to that in Sokolov-Hickl (Game 1), when the bishop
will soon go to e3;
B) 8.♘f3 is also not very logical since the knight precludes the
safeguarding f2-f3, which will soon be necessary. After 8…♗d6
9.♗e3 ♘c6 10.0-0-0 ♔e7 the white position is less flexible than in
Sokolov-Hickl. It is not easy to recommend a clear plan to the first
player; e.g. 11.♘d2 ♘g4 12.♗g5+ ♔d7 13.♗h4 ♖hf8, with good
play for Black
8…a6 9.♘h3 ♗d6
Our standard build-up.
A) 9…♗b4!? is an interesting try for those who enjoy
experimenting. After 10.♗d2 White is again pressed to castle

queenside after 10…♘c6, with typical play; e.g. 11.0-0-0 (11.♔f2?!
♔e7 12.♖hd1 ♗c5+ 13.♗e3 ♗d4=) 11…♔e7 12.♘f2 h6 13.♘d3
♗d6 14.♗e3 ♘d7 15.b3 b5 16.♔b2 ♘a5 17.♘f2 c5 18.♖d2 ♘b7
19.♖hd1 ♖hc8 20.a3 ♖c6 .
But it is unclear whether Black would really benefit by using his
bishop to shatter the white queenside after 10.♘f2!?∞;
B) 9…♗c5 looks attractive, but it results in a loss of tempo after
10.♘f2 ♘c6 11.♘d3 ♗d6 (11…♘b4?! 12.♘xc5 ) 12.♗e3.
10.♘f2 ♔e7 11.♗e3 ♘c6 12.♘d3 ♘d7
In this game the first player is not deterred and keeps his king in the
center. This makes his opponent’s queenside pawn storm less
effective than if he had castled queenside.
13.♘e2 b5
Initiating a pawn storm and at the same time preventing c2-c4.
A) 13…h6 is possible, but it permits 14.c4 b6!? (14…♔f7 15.♔f2
; the white king is not in danger here):
A1) 15.0-0-0 ♖hd8 16.♔b1  With the interpolation c2-c4 the
white king is quite safe on b1;
A2) 15.♔f2 ♘c5 16.♖hd1 (16.♘xc5 ♗xc5 17.♗xc5+ bxc5
18.♖hd1 ♖hd8= Black can easily protect the weak pawns at e5 and
c5. The d4-square, the semi-open b-file, and the possible …♘b4-d3

(c2) are good compensation for the inflexible pawn structure) 16…
♘xd3+ 17.♖xd3 ♖hd8 18.♖ad1 ♘b4
B) 13…♘b4 14.♘xb4 ♗xb4+ 15.♔f2 ♗c5 16.♖hd1 ♗xe3+
17.♔xe3 ♘c5 ;

the queenside. Here is a sample variation: 14.b3 c5 15.♘b2 b5

♗xb2 23.♘xb2 ♘b3 24.♖b1 ♘xd2 25.♔xd2 ♖xa2=) 22…♘c4
Black has full compensation for the pawn invested. In over-the-
board play it is not easy for the player of the white pieces to look
after his numerous weaknesses.
14.a4
With this advance White takes over the initiative; Black, however, is
able to maintain approximate equality by simplifying the position.
14…h6 15.b3 ♘b4 16.♘xb4 ♗xb4+ 17.♔f2

Now White is threatening to take over the a-file with the plan of
♖a2 and ♖ha1.
17…♗c5
Now, through the exchange of bishops and the subsequent transfer
of the knight to b6 Black forces clarification of the position and the
exchange of rooks.

♖a8 23.♖xa8 ♘xa8

White has no more than a symbolic advantage: the weak e5-pawn
can be attacked by the knight and must be protected by Black’s
knight or king, but this is of little significance so long as there aren’t
any further weaknesses.

Conclusion
If White succeeds in keeping his king in the middle and at the same
time neutralizing Black’s initiative on the queen’s wing, he has a
good chance of keeping a small advantage. But the queenside pawn
storm gives Black good practical chances if he plays energetically
with, for example, 13…♘a5.
Section 2: Alternatives on the 6th Move
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8
Whereas the game takes on rather a closed character after 6.♗c4
♗e6 7.♗xe6 fxe6 and the king is secure at e7, in other lines at the
6th move White often strives for an early opening of the board with
f2-f4. In that event, c8 is usually the best refuge for the black
monarch.

Game 3

Croatia tt 2015
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8 6.♗g5
Besides 6.♗c4, this is the other main line. White relies on quick
development and queenside castling before Black can erect a safe
setup with …♗d6, …♗e6 and …♘bd7.
6…♗e6 7.0-0-0+ ♘bd7 8.f4
White forces the play to take advantage of his lead in development.
8…exf4
This move is absolutely necessary here, as f4-f5 was threatened.
White now remains with a pawn weakness in the center of the
board.
9.♘f3
A) White achieves little with 9.e5 in view of 9…h6 10.♗xf4
(10.♗h4?! g5 11.exf6 gxh4  and Black’s king bishop is very strong)
10…♘g4 11.♖d2 g5 12.♗g3 ♘e3 13.♘f3 ♗b4=;
B) 9.♘ge2 is answered with 9…♗d6, after which 10.♘xf4 h6
leads to the exchange of White’s queen’s bishop for Black’s king’s
knight. 11.♗xf6+ gxf6= The fine piece square e5 and the strong
dark squares compensate for the deterioration of Black’s pawn

structure. Black strives for the setup …♗e5, …c6 and, optionally, …
♔e7 or …♔c7
9…♔c8 10.♗xf4 ♗c5
The dark-squared bishops are to be exchanged.
11.h3
11.♗e2N is a promising attempt to avoid the exchange, but Black
has enough time for the maneuver …c7-c6, …♗b6 and …♗c7. 11…
c6 12.♘d4 ♗b6 13.h3 ♗c7 14.♗e3 ♗e5=. The second player has
the e5-square for his pieces, compensating him for giving up the
bishop pair. Since his position offers hardly any points of attack,
Black can complete his development undisturbed.
11…♘h5 12.♗h2 ♗e3+ 13.♔b1 ♗f4
This simplification enhances the safety of his king, which will now be
well positioned after …c7-c6 and …♔c7. At the same time, the
exchange of bishops prepares the transfer of a knight to e5.
14.♗xf4
14.g4 ♗xh2 15.♖xh2 ♘f4 16.♖f2 ♘g6 17.♘g5 ♘ge5 18.♘b5 h6
19.♘xe6 fxe6 20.♘d4 ♘c5=
14…♘xf4

Black has complete equality and can make use of the long-term
deficits of the white position: on the one hand the e5-square, and on
the other the inactivity of the white bishop, which has too many of
its own pawns standing in its way.

Conclusion
Black swapped the dark-squared bishops and gained the e5-square
for his knight, which was clearly superior to White’s king bishop.

7.g3 This system has gained in popularity over the past few years.
With the pawn pair f4/e4 White wants to dispute the natural support
points of the black pieces at e6 and f6: 7…♔c8 8.f4
analysis diagram
8…exf4N At this juncture Black can turn the tables. With his king
tolerably safe at c8, his pieces can attack the white center. 9.gxf4
♗c5 White now faces a typical dilemma: if he moves one of the
pawns, which is difficult to avoid, weaknesses result. The play now
becomes quite double-edged:
A) 10.f5 ♗d7  Black can either attack the e4-pawn or control the
blockade-square e5;
B) 10.♗xf6 gxf6 (threatening …f6-f5) 11.f5 ♗d7 ;
C) 10.♘f3 ♖e8 ;
D) 10.♗e2 ♘e8  with the idea …f7-f6, …♘d6, …♖e8;

♘bd7 15.♘g5 a6 and White can prevent Black’s setup with …b7-b6,

…♖e8 and …♔b7 with the resourceful 16.♘e6, which after 16…
fxe6 17.fxe6 ♖e8 18.exd7+ ♗xd7 leads to a level game.
7…♔c8
8.♘f3
As is almost always the case in the Endgame Variation, this move is
harmless.
8.f4 exf4 9.♘f3 ♗c5 10.♗xf4 ♘bd7 leads, by transposition, to
Game 3 (Golubovic-Markus).
8…♘bd7 9.♗xf6
This is a bad idea. The weakness of the doubled-pawn complex
cannot be exploited here, while the strength of the remaining dark-
squared bishop will soon become apparent.
9.♗h4 h6 would have given a level game.
9…gxf6  10.♘h4
White fixes the f6-pawn and would like to win the e4-square for his
bishop or knight with ♘f5, …♗xf5, exf5. But this idea does not
work, as Black activates his pieces first.
10…c6 11.♔b1
The variation 11.♘f5?! ♗b4 12.♘e2?! ♗xa2!  shows the potential
of the bishop pair: 13.b3 ♘c5! 14.♔b2 ♗xb3 15.cxb3 ♘xe4
11…♘c5 12.f3

12…h5
We can dispense with the typical stabilization of the c5-knight with
…a7-a5, since the move b2-b4 would leave incurable weaknesses in
the white position and give the second player the lever …a7-a5.
13.♘e2 ♔c7 14.♘c1
The strong c5-knight is to be traded off.
After 14.♘g3 ♗h6 15.♘gf5 White is successful in placing a knight
on f5, but it is not all that effective here. Black has sufficient forces
on the queenside to carry out an attack there: 15…♗g5 16.g3 a5
17.♗e2 b5
14…♗h6 15.♘d3 ♖ad8 16.♗e2

The opening has clearly turned out in Black’s favor: his pieces are
more actively placed and his rooks can apply pressure down the
semi-open g-file. The dark-squared bishop can cause White a lot of
trouble, including his attempt to provide an airhole for his king – the
standard move b2-b3, for example, is hardly playable. Now,
Khismatullin sidesteps the knight exchange so as not to reduce his
chances of winning. In the phase that follows, it is the dark squares
that dominate the play.

This game shows the strength of the dark-squared bishop as soon as
its opposite number was exchanged for a knight.

Game 5

Sao Paulo/Bilbao 2012
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8
6.♘f3
This natural developing move is in fact a slight inaccuracy. White
completely ‘forgets’ to exploit the disadvantages of Black’s position,
causing problems for him.
6.♗e3 is also somewhat slow: 6…♗d6 7.♘f3 ♔e7 8.0-0-0 (8.♗c4
♗e6 9.♗xe6 fxe6 transposes to the system with 6.♗c4 ♗e6) 8…
♗e6 and if White disturbs Black’s build-up with 9.♘g5, Black
counters with 9…♘g4 10.♘xe6 ♘xe3 11.♖xd6! ♔xd6 12.♘g5 f6
13.♘f7+ ♔e6! 14.♘xh8 ♘xf1 15.♖xf1 ♘a6=.
6…♗d6

The coordination of the black forces is assured: his further
development by …♗e6, …♔e7, and, optionally, …♘bd7 or …♘c6, is
hardly to be prevented.
7.♗g5
Played a move earlier this would have caused real headaches for
Black, but here the exchange ♗xf6+ does not pose any threat. The
minor weakening of Black’s pawn structure is in most cases more
than offset by the (later) activity of the only remaining dark-squared
bishop.
A) 7.♘g5 ♔e7 8.♗c4 ♖f8= is completely harmless;
B) 7.♗c4 ♗e6 8.♗xe6 fxe6 leads by transposition to the system
with 6.♗c4 ♗e6.
7…♗e6 8.0-0-0 ♘bd7
Black’s position is perfectly fine. The minor defect that the rooks are
not yet connected cannot be exploited, as there are no levers for
opening the position.
9.♘b5
The Spanish GM will at least procure for himself the two bishops.
After 9.♗b5 ♔c8! Black is well developed, e.g. 10.♗xf6 ♘xf6
11.♘g5 ♖d8 12.♘xe6 fxe6 13.f3 c6 14.♗c4 ♔d7=.

analysis diagram
A typical example of the positional advantages conferred by a central
doubled pawn: Black’s king is unassailable on e7 and his bishop will
find activity at c5. In contrast, White’s bishop is limited in its activity
by his own and his opponent’s pawns.
It should be noted that here the black king would not be well placed
in the middle of the board right away: 9…♔e7? 10.♗xd7 ♗xd7
11.♘d5+ ♔e6 12.♗xf6 gxf6 13.♘h4  Here, Black’s bishop pair is
too passive and his king is vulnerable; White can, for example,
undermine Black’s defenses later on with c4-c5.
9…♔e7
Of course.
10.♘xd6 cxd6

Owing to the early exchange of queens we can see the advantages
of the solid and flexible setup with the bishop at e6 and the knights
at f6 and d7 – as well as the extra pawn in the center. Now that his
development is complete the second player can both utilize the half-
open c-file and (after thorough preparation) strive to advance with …
d6-d5.
11.♗b5 ♖hd8
The d6-pawn, considering the threatened doubling of the rooks on
the d-file, will sooner or later be in need of additional protection –
and the best player in the world spares himself any brooding over
the possible doubling of his pawns on f6 or further simplifications.
11…♖ac8 was also quite possible, since after 12.♗xd7 ♗xd7
13.♗xf6+ gxf6= the threat to dissolve the doubled pawns with …f6-
f5 and get a preponderance of pawns in the center is in the long run
of no less importance than the weakness at f5. But Black has no
need of this somewhat complicated way of playing.
12.♘d2
The unfortunate knight makes way for the f-pawn, but now his rook
and dark-squared bishop are blocked.
12…h6 13.♗h4 g5
Carlsen lifts the pin on the knight so that soon he can push with …
d6-d5, according to plan. A side effect is that White has no chance
of opening the center with f2-f4.

14.♗g3 a6
15.♗xd7
As a result of this exchange Black soon gets a clear superiority on
the light squares.
Somewhat better was 15.♗e2 ♖ac8, e.g. 16.♔b1 d5 17.f3! dxe4
(17…d4?! 18.♗e1! is unclear: White need not suffer from his
disadvantage in space, as each of his pieces has a good square; the
possibility ♗b4 is worrisome for the second player) 18.♘xe4 ♘d5
19.♗f2 f5 20.♘d2 ♘7f6 21.♖he1, after which Black, with 21…
♘b4, still maintains a small advantage, although in view of the play
over the whole board and his airy king position he must proceed
with great care.
15…♖xd7 16.f3 ♖c8 17.♔b1

17…♘h5
Carlsen prefers …f7-f5 over …d6-d5, since then he would have a
central pawn majority.
18.♘f1 f5 19.exf5 ♗xf5 20.♘e3 ♗g6
Black can cover the d5-square with …♔e6 and, if the need arises, …
♘f6.
21.♖d2?!
21.♔a1! was the best defense.
21…♔e6 22.b3 b5
The support point c4 is of course denied to White’s knight.
23.♔b2 d5

Black’s strategy has triumphed – the centralized king and the pawn
duo give him an advantage. In the following interesting endgame
the Norwegian is able to break through
24.♖e1 ♘xg3 25.hxg3 h5 26.c3?! ≥ 26.g4 h4 27.c3 a5  26…d4! 27.cxd4

39.axb5 d3+ 40.♔e3 h3 41.♘xd3 ♗xd3
0-1
Conclusion
This game is a good example of the fact that even top GMs are not
particularly well-versed in the positional themes of the Endgame
Variation, and are less effective than in their main systems (this is
even more apparent in the case of lower-rated players). After 6.♘f3,
which does not make much of an impression, and especially after
the erroneous exchange 9.♘b5 and 10.♘xd6, Black already had the
superior structure in the center, which Carlsen was later able to
expand with the …d6-d5 advance.

1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8 6.f4

This direct attack allows Black a tactical counter-action against the
white center.
6…♗b4 7.♗d3
White’s build-up makes sense: if Black takes on f4, White wins an
important tempo for development. Hence it is important to exploit
the only problem in his opponent’s position – the fact that the white
king remains in the center:
7.♗d2 exf4 (Black should not prefer to part with his king bishop for
a temporary win of a pawn: 7…♗xc3 8.♗xc3 ♘xe4 9.♗xe5 f6 10.0-

with …b7-b6, …♖e7 and …♔b7.
7…♖e8! 8.fxe5
8.♘ge2 ♘bd7 followed by …♗d6, …♘xe5, …♗d7 and …♔c8 (or …
c7-c6 and …♔c7) is harmless.

8…♘xe4! 9.♗xe4 ♗xc3+ 10.bxc3 ♖xe5
The play is very tactical – you should master the following variations!
Still, after White castles queenside Black will obviously turn to his
mobilization on that wing.
11.♗g5+! ♖xg5?!
An inaccuracy that can hardly be allowed in this position! Now
White’s lead in development takes menacing forms – the black king
becomes an object of attack.
11…♔e8N is stronger. White cannot avoid trading a pair of rooks,
which will attenuate his initiative markedly: 12.0-0-0 ♘d7 13.♖e1
(13.♘f3 ♖xe4 14.♖he1 ♖xe1! 15.♖xe1+ ♔f8 16.♗f4 ♘b6

12.♘f3 ♖c5 13.0-0-0+♘d7?!
13…♔e7 is the computer’s preferred, tenacious defense. But who
likes to leave an enemy rook on the eighth rank? 14.♖he1 ♔f6
15.♖d8 ♘d7 16.g4 h6 17.h4 g5 18.♖h8 ♘e5  is the engine’s sober
analysis. But Black’s game is hanging by a silk thread.

14.♗xh7?
Missing the chance to keep the black king in the middle of the
board.
14.♖he1! c6 (14…g6 15.♗d5 c6 16.♗xf7 ; 14…a5 15.♗d5! c6
16.♗xf7 ) 15.♗xh7! would have restored the material balance, with
a huge lead in development as before.
14…a5?!
Black, in turn, forgoes the chance to take flight with his king.
14…♔e7 15.♖he1+ ♔f8 16.♗e4 g5! was a chance for equality that
Black could not have hoped for. With …♘b6 Black can complete the
development of his queen’s wing, while his king finds a safe place on
g7. For example, 17.h4 (17.♗xb7 ♗xb7 18.♖xd7 ♗xf3 19.gxf3
♖e8=) 17…gxh4 18.♘xh4 ♘b6=.
15.h4

into play and thereby equalize.

Conclusion

Black combats the fast central lever f2-f4 by tactical means. After
the exchange of rooks in the 11…♔e8 variation he can even get the
advantage with his better pawn structure. So White should opt for
7.♗d2, with approximately level play. The analysis of this game
shows the dangerous consequences there can be in this type of
position, as well as the inconspicuous inaccuracies that may occur.

1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.♘f3 exd4 5.♘xd4 ♗e7
This is the starting position of the Antoshin Variation, named after
the Soviet grandmaster Vladimir Sergeyevich Antoshin (1929-1994),
who popularized the system in the 1950s. The bishop’s position on
e7 is a modest one and is somewhat confined. However, Black is
able to develop rapidly and is giving his opponent no points of
attack. After castling, the second player can exert pressure on the
e4-pawn with …♖e8 and …♗f8 and seek to gain space by …d6-d5.
An important procedure consists of the pawn advance on the
queenside with …c7-c6 and …b7-b5, followed by driving away
White’s knight with …b5-b4, and lastly, …d6-d5. White, for his part,
has the freedom to deploy his forces in any way he wishes.
Generally speaking, there are three basic ways in which White can
play:
1) He can castle kingside and open the game with the pawn lever
f2-f4 and e4-e5;
2) He can try to prevent Black’s freeing attempt, outlined above,
through overprotecting d5 as much as possible by, among other
things, putting his king’s bishop on c4, f3, or g2;

3) He can castle queenside and launch a pawn storm on the
kingside to get a mating attack. The currently popular variation
6.♗f4 follows this approach.
As dangerous and defensive as this variation may appear from the
point of view of the black player, White’s game is not as easy as it
looks at first sight! Black’s position is without weaknesses and he has
a number of opportunities to expand and put the e4-pawn under
pressure. If White sends his pawns forward, gaps will arise; if he
leaves them where they stand, it will not be easy for him to maintain
his space advantage.
In this chapter, we will become familiar with the formations and
plans for both White and Black that characterize the play in this
system. We’ll start with the variations involving 6.♗c4 and 6.♗e2 as
well as the fianchetto of the king’s bishop. We shall pay particular
attention to the build-up with 6.♗f4 followed by a kingside pawn
storm, which in practical play is dangerous for Black. Finally, we shall
look at some less frequent lines.
Game 7

Kuala Lumpur 2010
1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 d6 3.d4 exd4 4.♘xd4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 ♗e7
In this chapter we’ll see this line more often than not (1.e4 d6 2.d4
♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.♘f3 exd4 5.♘xd4 ♗e7 is our repertoire line).
6.♗c4

With this natural setup White strengthens his control of the
important d5-square and at the same time aims his bishop at Black’s
kingside.
6…0-0 7.0-0 ♘c6
7…♖e8 8.♖e1 (after 8.f4, Black threatens with 8…c6! to refute the
premature attack with the central counter …d6-d5. The consistent
9.e5? then fails to the opening of the diagonal for the
unprepossessing king’s bishop: 9…dxe5 10.fxe5 ♗c5 ) 8…♘bd7 is
our repertoire line. After that, 9.h3 ♘e5 transposes to our game.
The simplification after 7…♘xe4 8.♘xe4 d5 9.♗d3 dxe4 10.♗xe4
does not lead to equality. White’s better development is very
unpleasant for Black.
8.h3 ♖e8 9.♖e1 ♘e5 10.♗f1
A thoroughly logical and popular retreat. The bishop is quite safe
here, and after the e5-knight is driven away the bishop can again
take up the fine a2-g8 diagonal.
All the same, 10.♗b3 is the main reply, after which we continue with
10…c6. Since White can combine this move with some aggressive
plans, we will analyze this variation in somewhat more detail.

analysis diagram
In the diagram position White has the following options:
A) After 11.♗g5, Black, with 11…h6N, forces White to decide on
which side of the board his queen’s bishop is to operate:
A1) 12.♗e3 hands away a tempo, as the extra move …h7-h6 is
rather useful for Black. There follows 12…♗d7 with the idea …b7-
b5;
A2) After 12.♗h4 the bishop is cut off from the center and
queenside. Black can initiate queenside counterplay with 12…b5!,
which is typical in this position: 13.f4 (13.♗g3 ♗d7 14.♘f5 ♗xf5
15.exf5 ♘c4=) 13…♘g6 14.♗f2 (14.♘xc6?? ♕b6+!–+) 14…♕c7
15.♕f3 b4 16.♘ce2 d5! 17.♘g3 (17.exd5 cxd5 18.♗xd5?! ♘xd5
19.♕xd5 ♗b7 ; 17.e5 ♘e4= 18.c4 bxc3 19.♘xc3 ♘d2) 17…dxe4
18.♘xe4 ♗d7=
B) 11.f4N is thematic. The idea, to chase away the f6-knight with
e4-e5, is very dangerous and must always be watched for. Black is
helped by the activity of his king’s bishop and the c5-g1 diagonal
opened to it after e4-e5 and …dxe5: 11…♘ed7 (Black increases the
pressure on e4; the typical queenside counterplay beginning with …
♗d7 is too late in this position, since White can get an ideal setup
with ♕f3: 11…♘g6 12.♗e3 ♗d7 13.a4 b6 14.♕f3 a6 15.g4! )
Now:

B1) 12.♘f5 ♘c5 and White must soon give back the bishop pair
that he gains with 13.♘xe7+ ♕xe7: 14.e5 ♘fd7 15.♗e3 dxe5
16.♗xc5 ♕xc5, with equality;
B2) 12.♗e3 ♘c5 13.♗f2 h6 Here we reach a critical position, in
reference to which we can study a few typical attacking and
defensive motifs:
analysis diagram
B21) 14.e5 dxe5 15.fxe5 ♘h7 16.e6 ♘xe6 17.♘xe6 ♗xe6
18.♗xe6 fxe6 19.♖xe6 (19.♕g4 ♘f8 ) 19…♕xd1+ 20.♖xd1
♘f6=;
B22) 14.♗c4 d5! 15.exd5 cxd5 16.♗d3 ♗d7= In the isolated
pawn position the advance of the f-pawn is more of a hindrance than
a help;
B23) 14.♕f3 ♗d7 15.♖ad1 ♘xb3 16.axb3 ♘h7  White has
prevented his opponent from immediately developing his forces, but
Black has good prospects: he offers his opponent no points of
attack; plus, sooner or later the position will be opened and the
bishop pair will have something to say.
B3) 12.e5 dxe5 13.fxe5 ♗c5! 14.♘a4 ♘d5 15.c4 ♗xd4+
16.♕xd4 ♘c7 17.♕f2 ♘e6 18.♗e3 ♕c7 19.♖ad1 ♘xe5 . White
has good compensation for the pawn, but Black also has his

chances. If White grabs the pawn on a7 he will not be able to avoid
the perpetual check after 20.♗xa7 ♖xa7! 21.♕xa7 ♘f3+ 22.gxf3
♕g3+ 23.♔f1 c5!.
C) With 11.a4 White tries to hold up Black’s expansion on the
queenside. But after 11…♗d7 Black, with …♕a5 and …a7-a6, can
wait for White’s a1-rook to move away, after which he can launch his
pawn storm with …b7-b5. For example:
C1) 12.a5 b5! 13.axb6 axb6 14.♖xa8 ♕xa8 15.f4 ♘g6 16.♘f3
(16.♘f5 ♗xf5 17.exf5 ♘f8=) 16…♗e6 17.♗xe6 fxe6 18.f5 ♘f8
19.g4 h6=;
C2) 12.♗f4 ♘g6 13.♗h2 ♕a5 (the queen blocks the white a-
pawn in preparation for …b7-b5. But Black has to watch out for the
typical tricks involved in the move of the a1-rook: after ♕d2 and
♖ad1 White can play ♘c3-d5) 14.♕d2 ♖ad8:
C21) 15.♘f3 ♗e6 16.♗xe6 fxe6 17.♘d5 ♕xd2 18.♘xe7+ ♖xe7
19.♘xd2 d5= 20.exd5 exd5 21.♖xe7 ♘xe7 22.♖e1 ♖d7 23.♘f3
♘g6 24.♘d4 ;
C22) 15.♖ad1N 15…a6 16.♔h1 (16.♘d5?! ♕xd2 17.♘xe7+
♖xe7 18.♖xd2 ♖xe4 ) 16…♗f8 17.f3 (17.f4 c5! ) 17…♕b4 (Black
threatens …c6-c5-c4!) 18.♕f2 (18.g4 c5 19.♘f5 c4 20.♗a2
♕xb2∞) 18…b5 19.axb5 axb5 20.♘f5 d5! 21.g4 ♘e5 22.exd5 ♘c4
We return to the main game:

10…♗f8 11.♗f4
The diagonal h2-d6 is the right posting for the white bishop. It can
support the lever f2-f4 followed by e4-e5 and can apply pressure to
the d6-pawn as soon as Black has played the thematic …c7-c6.
Hence the second player must generally place a knight on e5
between the bishop and the pawn needing defense.
11…c6 12.a4
12.♕d2 is the subject of the next game.
12…a5
Black bars the further advance of the white a-pawn and tightens his
control of the b4- and c5-squares. But in so doing he limits his own
queenside possibilities: the later …b7-b5 advance, especially, is now
precluded.
12…♗d7!? is also possible: the move …a7-a5 can follow later on,
should Black find time for …b7-b6, …a7-a6 and …b6-b5.
In the following sample variation we see how Black can get
counterplay with the aid of …♗b4: 13.♕d2 h6 14.♖ad1 ♕b6 (14…
♗d7  is playable) 15.♗e3N ♕b4 16.b3 ♗d7 17.f4 ♘g6 18.♗c4
♘xe4 19.♘xe4 ♖xe4 20.c3 ♕b6 21.♗d3 ♖ee8 22.f5 ♘e5 23.♘e6
♕xb3 24.♘xf8 ♘xd3! 25.♕xd3 ♖xf8 26.f6 ♖fe8=
13.♔h1

After the fixing of the queenside with a2-a4 and …a7-a5 all White’s
plans are bound up with the lever f2-f4 followed by e4-e5. It is also
sensible to pull the king off the b6-g1 diagonal.
13…♘ed7
The knight maneuvers …♘e5-d7-c5 or …♘f6-d7-c5 are typical in
this formation. After …♘c5 the pressure on the e4-pawn will hamper
White’s game considerably.
A) 13…♘g6 14.♗g3 ♕b6 15.♕d2 ♗d7 16.f4 ♖ad8 17.♗f2 ♕c7
18.♖ad1 ♗c8 , with the idea …♘f6-d7-c5, is a solid setup,
although it will not be altogether easy to activate the g6-knight;
B) 13…♘fd7!? looks to place the knights on c5 and f6, from
where they will exert the maximum possible pressure: 14.♗e3 ♘c5
15.f4 ♘ed7 16.♕f3 g6
analysis diagram
The formation is very similar to the ‘Boleslavsky Wall,’ which we
occasionally arrive at in our repertoire from the Old Indian Defense
(see Chapter 4). The ‘small’ difference is that there the white c-pawn
stands on c4, which has positive and negative aspects: on the one
hand Black can in the diagram above get in …d6-d5; on the other,
with the pawn at c4, Black’s control of the dark squares b4 and c5 is

stronger. The position is quite playable – the better player wins!
17.♖ad1 ♕e7∞
14.♘f5
Thakur wants to hinder Black’s regrouping and through this enjoys
success! It is possible that Iuldachev wanted to avoid a repetition.
14…♘c5?!
The Uzbek grandmaster decides not to sound the depths of the
options offered him by a complicated middlegame and forces
liquidation to a slightly worse endgame.
14…♘e5= 15.♘d4 ♘fd7!?
15.♘xd6 ♗xd6 16.♕xd6 ♕xd6 17.♗xd6 ♘cxe4 18.♘xe4 ♘xe4 19.♗c5
♗f5 20.♗e3
The bishop pair affords White somewhat better chances, and
contributes to the weakness of Black’s queenside. Most likely in time
pressure, in the back and forth of the rest of the game, the
grandmaster, with a bit of luck, was finally able to score the point.

Conclusion
In this game we looked at two setups with which Black can oppose
the white pressure on d6 and the planned lever f2-f4 and e4-e5:
1) The advance …c7-c6, …♗d7, …b5-b4, followed by …d6-d5.
2) The formation a2-a4, …a7-a5, in which Black places his knights
on e5 and f6, thus creating pressure on e4.

The somewhat modest development of the white bishop to e2
likewise holds dangers for Black: the first player can prepare a rapid
f2-f4 and e4-e5.
6…0-0
7.0-0

White can also combine the moves ♗e2 and ♗f4, as recommended
in the current and much-respected Grandmaster Repertoire: 1.e4
book by the Indian grandmaster Parimarjan Negi. Here, too, we
react with the standard setup …♘c6-e5 and …c7-c6: 7.♗f4 ♘c6
(7…♘bd7 8.♘f5 ) 8.0-0 ♘e5 (an interesting moment: Norwegian
grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer is known for his collaboration with
World Champion Magnus Carlsen and is certainly well-versed in all
standard openings. Against the Antoshin Variation, however, he
(initially) is surprisingly uncertain and allows Black obvious equality.
This will be typical of your tournament games, also: your opponents
will lack the experience they have in their usual openings!) 9.♘f5
(9.h3; 9.a4) 9…♗xf5 10.exf5 c6= 11.g4 ♕c7?! (this aimless
‘developing move’, or rather a clear loss of tempo, unfortunately
does not remain unaccompanied, so that Black soon succumbs to
the dangers of the pawn roller g4-g5 and f5-f6. 11…♘fd7 – 12…d5
– would have emphasized the disadvantages of the white pawn
formation) 12.♗g3 b5?! (12…d5) 13.g5 ♘fd7 14.b3 ♘c5? (14…b4;

8.♖e1
White decides on quieter play. After the retreat of the bishop to f1
we have positions similar to those after 6.♗c4.
8.f4 In combination with the development of the bishop to e2, the
advance of the f-pawn offers additional possibilities to the first
player: he can move the bishop to f3, where he controls d5 and
indirectly counteracts the black expansion with …c7-c6 and …b7-b5,
after which the opening of the long diagonal with e4-e5 hangs in the
air. Instead, we use the advance 8…c5 to make use of the early
opening of the diagonal c5-g1: 9.♘b3 ♘c6 10.♗f3 ♗f8 11.♖e1
(11.♗e3 ♗f5 12.exf5 ♖xe3 13.♘d5 ♘xd5 14.♕xd5 ♕b6=) 11…c4
(the knight is forced to the sensitive diagonal c5-g1, and the bishop
at c1 and the rook on a1 cannot intervene in the battle on a kingside
weakened with f2-f4. 11…a5 12.a4 ♘b4! is an interesting possibility
to prepare the central lever …d6-d5, although in so doing he accepts
the weakness of the b5-square) 12.♘d4 (12.♘d2 ♘d4, 13.♘xc4

A very tense tactical situation has arisen that well illustrates the
dangers of an early f2-f4 advance. In the game before us, even

grandmasters fail to play correctly!
A) 14…♕h4? is rash, bringing a top GM into difficulties: with the
help of the king’s bishop White could have won the d5-pawn:
A1) 15.♘d4? ♗c5 16.♘ce2? (16.♗xg4 ♗xg4 17.♖e2) 16…

B) 14…♗c5+! solves all Black’s problems. White can hold the
position with accurate defense: 15.♘d4 ♕h4 16.♗xg4 ♗xg4
17.♖e2  ♗xd4+ 18.♕xd4 ♗xe2 19.♗d2 ♗g4
8…♗f8 9.♗f1
White retreats his bishop and selects the build-up that we saw in the
previous game.
9…♘bd7
10.♗f4
White sees …c7-c6 coming and develops his bishop to its best
square. But Black can alleviate the pressure on d6 with …♘e5. He
must always be prepared with …♗xf5 against the threat ♘f5.
A) With 10.g3 c6 White can choose to fianchetto the bishop,
transitioning to positions from the variations 6.g3 and 6.♘de2,

which we discuss in the following game. White’s loss of tempo eases
Black’s game, of course;
B) 10.f3 is not very purposeful in connection with ♖e1 and ♗f1:
10…c6 11.♗e3 ♘e5 12.a4 ♗d7 13.♕d2 (13.♗f2) and because of
the weakness as a result of f2-f3 it is entirely in order for Black to
transition to an isolani position: 13…d5 14.exd5 cxd5=;
C) After 10.♗g5 h6 11.♗h4 the pin on the f6-knight can be lifted
at any moment with …♗e7. Black plays on the queenside and in the
center: 11…c6 12.♕d2 ♘e5 13.f3 ♗d7 14.a4 ♗e7!? (threatening
15…♘xe4!) 15.♗f2 a6 16.a5 ♕c7 17.♘a4 c5 18.♘f5 ♗xf5 19.exf5
♖ad8=
10…c6 11.h3 ♘e5 12.♕d2
With this, White allows immediate counterplay on the queenside.
12.a4 was discussed in the previous game.
12…b5!
In view of the unprotected queen on d2 White cannot now capture
on e5 and c6. Now he must neutralize Black’s initiative on the
queenside.
13.a3 ♗d7
The thematic build-up. The bishop watches f5 and protects e6. After
a possible …b5-b4 and …c6-c5 the bishop can always be brought via
c6 to the long diagonal.

A) 13…♗b7? must be prepared with …g7-g6; here it is premature
because of 14.♖ad1 g6 15.♗g5 ;
B) 13…a5!N was more energetic; White can maintain the balance:
14.♗g5 ♗d7 15.f4 ♘g6 16.♗xf6 ♕xf6 17.g3 d5 (17…h5!? 18.h4
d5) 18.e5 ♕d8  White’s far advanced kingside pawns, after the
exchange of the queen’s bishop, are without teeth, and the
imminent opening of the position will turn out in favor of the bishop
pair.
14.♗h2
White throws his positional advantages on the scale; the bishop
supports the lever f2-f4 and e4-e5.
14.♘f5 ♗xf5 15.exf5 ♕c8=
14…a5 15.f4
15…♘g6
Now both sides must play their trumps if they are not to fall behind.
Another possibility is the pinning ploy 15…♕b6. Here too the game
remains even with accurate play; e.g. 16.♔h1 ♘c4 17.♗xc4 bxc4
18.e5 ♘d5 19.♘e4 dxe5 20.fxe5 h6 21.♕f2 ♖ad8 22.♖f1 ♔h8=
16.e5! b4! 17.axb4 axb4 18.♖xa8 bxc3 19.bxc3 ♕xa8 20.exf6 gxf6

In this position the weaknesses on both sides would appear to
balance each other. Black’s king is adequately protected by his minor
pieces despite the ugly doubled pawns. As the game proceeded,
Black got an advantage in the center, but couldn’t crack open his
opponent’s fortress in the endgame.

Conclusion
This game demonstrated important themes against the early white
advance 8.f2-f4 and e4-e5. It also showed Black’s queenside
counterplay with …c7-c6, …♗d7 and …b7-b5.
Game 9
Bogdan Grabarczyk 2393

Germany Bundesliga 2013/14
1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 d6 3.d4 exd4 4.♘xd4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 ♗e7 6.♘de2
With this somewhat extravagant move White prepares the fianchetto
of his king’s bishop without allowing the immediate counter-attack …
d6-d5. Since many white players also often play ♘d4-e2 after the
immediate fianchetto, both moves generally lead to similar positions
in our repertoire.
The knight on d4, however, exerts more pressure. After the
immediate fianchetto 6.g3 we choose the standard setup 6…0-0 (6…
d5 is a very theoretical variant that leads to some tactical
complications) 7.♗g2 ♖e8 8.0-0 ♗f8.
We consider 9.h3 and 9.b3:
A) 9.h3 c6

analysis diagram
White has directed all available forces against the advance …d6-d5.
But it is not easy for him to do anything active, e.g.:
A1) 10.♗g5 is somewhat aimless. After 10…h6 11.♗e3 ♘bd7
12.♖e1 ♘c5 13.f3…
analysis diagram
the Chinese GM could now take over the initiative in the center with
13…d5!: 0-1 (42), Smirnov-Bu Xiangzhi, Helsingor 2014;

A2) 10.♖e1 ♘bd7 11.f4 (11.♗f4) is more energetic. In contrast
to the setup in the two previous games, the lever e4-e5 is not
supported by White’s queen’s bishop, so it is infeasible. Black can
calmly take up his standard position, e.g. 11…a5 12.♗e3 ♘c5
13.♗f2 ♕c7 14.♘b3 ♘fd7∞;
A3) 10.♘de2 proceeds in a manner similar to the game: 10…
♘bd7 11.g4 ♘c5 12.♘g3 g6 13.♗f4 ♕c7 White has weakened his
kingside without being able to generate convincing active counter-
chances;
A4) The strongest move here is 10.♗f4, although here too Black
would have interesting possibilities at his disposal for obtaining
counterplay: 10…♘bd7 11.♕d2 ♘e5 12.♖ad1

B) 9.b3 is very popular. On b2 the bishop does not obstruct any
white piece and would command the long diagonal if the knights on

c3 and d4 did not obscure its view! This problem is not easy to
solve. After 9…♘bd7 10.♗b2 ♘c5 11.♖e1 a5 12.a4 c6 13.♕d2
♕b6 14.♖ad1, Black, with 14…g6N,
analysis diagram
would reach his standard setup, after which it would not be a simple
matter for White to attack the d6-pawn. Both sides have chances.
15.h3 ♗g7∞
Back to the main game.
6…♘bd7 7.g3 0-0 8.♗g2 ♖e8 9.0-0 ♗f8

By reference to this typical position of the system with g2-g3 and
♗g2, we can convince ourselves that the black setups considered in
the systems 6.♗c4 and 6.♗e2 also work well here. Certainly, many
players on the white side would, over the long run, like to attack on
the right side of the board, e.g. with h2-h3, g3-g4, ♘g3 and f2-f4,
followed by opening files and an attack on the king. But since this
takes quite a long time, Black has enough time for counter-actions
on the queen’s wing and in the center.
10.♗e3
In the game, White simply continues his development, without a lot
of regard for Black’s advance on the queenside.
A) After 10.h3N, Black, with 10…♘c5, reveals a problem with the
slowness of White’s game: the central pawn is not sufficiently
protected: 11.♕d4 c6 (with the idea …♕e7) and White comes under
pressure. 12.♗g5 is harmless in this position on account of 12…
♘e6;
B) 10.♖e1 addresses the weakness of the central pawn: 10…c6
11.a4 (11.♘d4!? is possibly the best move!; now c6 is under fire, so
that Black cannot expand so easily on the queenside) 11…♘c5
12.♘f4 At first glance White’s setup looks very convincing, but in
fact it is harmless. There is no real danger from the knight at f4,
which takes from the queen’s bishop its natural development square;
at worst, the exchange of the active c5-knight with ♘f4-d3 would be
unpleasant for Black. 12…a5 13.h3 ♘fd7 14.♗e3 g6 (14…b6!?N
followed by …♕c7, …♗b7, …♖ad8 is in this position a solid setup,
which would not be thinkable with a white knight on d4) 15.♕d2
♘e5 16.b3 b6N The chances are even (16…♕b6 is more
complicated, 0-1 (34) Grabarczyk-Zude, Germany Bundesliga B
2015): 17.♖ad1 ♖a7 18.♘ce2 ♖ae7 19.♘d4 ♕c7=
10…c6 11.h3
11.a4 is not a solution here. After 11…♘c5 12.♗xc5 dxc5 13.♕xd8
♖xd8 White cannot really get anything going with his 4:3 pawn
majority on the kingside.
Careful! Had Black already played …g7-g6 here, White, with h2-h3,
f2-f4 and e4-e5 could advantageously highlight the weakness of the
f6-square.

White has arranged his position soundly and strongly and (for the
moment!) Black cannot think of …d6-d5. Despite this, Black has an
easy game – his eventual queenside pawn advance will be very
effective here!
11…b5!  12.a3 ♗b7 13.g4 ♘e5
The Dutch grandmaster selects the thematic move; but there are
alternatives that are also worthy of consideration.
A) With 13…h6!?N Black can maintain the harmonious placement
of his knight, inasmuch as driving the knight away with h3-h4 and
g4-g5 or f2-f4 and g4-g5 would greatly weaken White’s kingside:
14.♘g3 a5  Now, White is already fighting for equality;
B) 13…g6N is also a very good option. After 14.♘g3 ♘b6! 15.b3
a5 Black’s queenside play takes concrete form. White has to keep his
attention on the kingside if he is not to arrive at a disadvantage:
16.g5 ♘fd7 17.f4 b4 18.axb4 axb4 19.♘ce2 ♖xa1 20.♕xa1 c5
21.♗f2 d5 22.e5 ♕c7 23.♕d1 d4∞
14.g5 ♘fd7 15.b3 ♘g6 16.♘g3

16…♕c7?!
A loss of tempo at a decisive moment! White can now take over the
initiative.
Black should immediately increase the pressure on the white center
with 16…a5. The following sample variations show that the second
player already has the better chances:
A) 17.f4 d5  18.e5?! ♘h4 19.♗h1 h6! 20.gxh6 g6! 21.♗f2
(21.f5?! ♖xe5! 22.♗f4 ♖xf5 ) 21…♗xh6 ;
B) 17.♘f5 17…♘c5 18.♕g4 ♗c8 19.h4 d5 20.♖fd1 ♗d6
21.exd5 h5! 22.gxh6 ♕f6 23.♕d4 ♗xf5 24.♕xf6 gxf6 25.dxc6 ♗e5
17.♘f5! ♘c5 18.h4

18…♖ad8
Now White can finally take control and brace himself with ♕g4 and
♖ad1 to face Black’s counterplay with …a7-a5 and …b5-b4. On the
right-hand side of the board he has a strong attack.
A) 18…♘e6 19.♕g4 would have granted White a promising
position without a fight;
B) Also, 18…♗c8 19.h5 ♗xf5 20.exf5 ♘h4 cannot equalize due
to 21.♘xb5! ♕d7 22.♘d4 d5 23.♖e1 ♘xg2 24.♔xg2 ;
C) Best here, even at the cost of material, is to open the position
and reveal the weaknesses in White’s position: the still vulnerable
kingside (before ♕g4) and the hanging position of both knights:
18…d5! would have preserved equality by tactical means: 19.exd5

1-0
Conclusion
This game demonstrates the idea of White’s strategy with g2-g3,
♗g2 and ♘de2: White plans a long-term, dangerous expansion on
the king’s wing. The variations showed how Black can get effective
counterplay on the queenside (with …b7-b5) and in the center (by
pressure on the e4-pawn).
Game 10
Kiprian Berbatov 2455
Jörg Hickl 2572
Sevilla 2010
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.♘f3 exd4 5.♘xd4 ♗e7 6.♗f4
This move is generally the introduction to a quite different plan:
White follows up with ♕d2 and queenside castling, and would like to
make use of his good central control for a pawn storm on the
kingside.
6…0-0 7.♕d2 ♘c6 8.0-0-0
8.♘xc6 bxc6 This ‘worsening’ of the black pawn structure makes no
sense here from White’s perspective; the half-open b-file more than
outweighs it. Black can continue with, among other ideas, …♘d7, …
♗f6 and …♖b8.
8…♘xd4 9.♕xd4 ♗e6

The tabiya of the system with 6.♗f4, ♕d2 and 0-0-0.
10.f3
We look at the alternatives in the next game.
10…a6
Black temporizes and prepares a later …b7-b5.
If the second player does not wish to offer a point of attack to the
pawn storm by playing 10…♘d7, White advantageously stations a
piece in the center, strictly according to Nimzowitsch’s precept
regarding the ‘outpost on the semi-open file’: 11.♘d5
After 10…♖e8 11.♗c4, too, Black has hardly anything better than
play on the queenside, since 11…♘d7?! 12.♗xe6 fxe6 13.e5 d5?! is
refuted by 14.♘xd5! .
11.g4
Now White’s plan is set. The (for the moment) less obligatory
11.♔b1 would lead, after 11…b5 (11…♘d7 12.♘d5  is just as
playable here) 12.g4 c5 (12…♘d7 13.♘d5 ♗xd5 14.♕xd5 )
13.♕d2 b4 14.♘d5 ♘xd5 15.exd5 ♗d7, to Game 11, Pötsch-Zude.
11…♘d7
This move takes a tempo from the white pawn storm; Black now
has, after g4-g5, a free move: …f7-f6, (among others) opening the
f-file as well as the seventh rank, is often possible. At the same time
the knight is moved to the queenside, where it can become active at
b6 or c5. In the game before us we learn a good deal about the

possibilities for each side in this type of position; as a repertoire
move we recommend, however, 11…b5, which we analyze in the
next game.
11…c5?! 12.♕e3  is out of the question.
12.♔b1
This typical prophylactic move is here rather feeble.
A) 12.♘d5!? presents Black with positional problems, which
however are solvable:
A1) 12…♗h4!?;
A2) 12…♗g5 13.h4 ♗xf4+ 14.♘xf4 ♕f6 15.♕xf6 ♘xf6 16.g5
♘d7 . The endgame is more pleasant for White, but is still tenable.
For example, 17.♗h3 ♖ae8 18.♘d5 ♗xd5 19.♗xd7 ♖e7 20.♖xd5
♖xd7 21.e5 ♖fd8 22.♖hd1 ♔f8=;
A3) 12…♗xd5 13.♕xd5 ♘e5!? 14.♗xe5 (14.♗e2 ♗g5=) 14…
dxe5 15.♕xe5 ♗d6 16.♕d5 ♕f6
B) But the immediate attack with 12.h4 would cause more
headaches for Black; e.g.:
B1) The computer-recommended 12…♗xh4?! is unconvincing:
13.♕d2! h6 14.♔b1 ♖e8N (14…b5? 15.♗xh6!  1-0 (25) Firman-
Kireev, Pardubice 2006) 15.♕h2 g5  16.♗c1 when Black’s game is
positionally ruined;

B2) After 12…b5 13.♕d2 the white pawn storm is easy to carry
out, while Black’s defense against it is not: 13…b4 14.♘d5 ♗xd5
15.♕xd5  Such situations involving castling on opposite wings, with
pawn storms on both sides, are to be avoided: deep holes are
opened in Black’s pawn front, whereas a favorable line opening lies
far in the future.
12…b5
Black cannot get by without queenside counterplay; hence it is more
purposeful to start it with the knight on f6.
Black does not reach equality with 12…♖e8 because of 13.♘d5!
♗xd5 14.♕xd5 ♘c5 15.h4 N (15.♗c1?! c6 16.♕d2 h6 17.♗g2 a5
18.h4 ♗xh4 19.♕xd6 ♕xd6 20.♖xd6 ♗g5 21.♖hd1 ½-½ Hracek-
Nevednichy, Budva 2002).
13.h4
This foot race will not decide the game in White’s favor.
By claiming an outpost with 13.♘d5 he could still obtain a slight
advantage: 13…♗h4 (13…♗xd5?! 14.♕xd5 ♘b6 15.♕c6 ) 14.♗g3
(14.g5 ♘e5 15.♗e2 ♗xd5 16.♕xd5 ♗xg5 17.♗xe5 dxe5 18.♕xe5
♕e7=) 14…♗xd5 15.♕xd5 ♕e7 16.♗g2 ♘b6 17.♕h5 ♗f6 18.g5
♗xg5 19.f4 ♗h6 20.e5 ♖ab8
13…♗f6 14.♕d2 ♘b6 15.g5
The young Bulgarian talent strives for a direct attack.

Again, 15.♘d5! offers White a positional advantage: 15…♗xd5
16.exd5 ♘a4 17.c3 b4 18.♕c2 ♕d7 19.g5 ♗xc3 20.♗c1
Inasmuch as after the occupation of the outpost square d5 the
exchange of minor pieces cannot well be avoided, it is better to
capture, without loss of tempo, with a knight still on f6. Hence our
repertoire move 11…b5 instead of 11…♘d7.
15…♗e5 16.♗e3
In the play that follows, attack and counter-attack just about balance
one another:
16…b4
16…c5!? 17.b3 (17.f4 ♗xc3 18.♕xc3 ♗g4 19.♖e1 ♗f3 20.♖h2

Conclusion
With the help of this game we were able to examine some important
motifs in the system with 6.♗f4 followed by ♕d2 and 0-0-0. After
an early and playable …♘d7 White has the somewhat better
chances. We study the queenside counter-attack in greater depth in
the next game.

This game was played in the last round and would decide the

well prepared and played the first 15 moves at a brisk pace.

Proceeding from this stem position in the 6.♗f4 variation White can

prophylactic moves.
10.f3
With this move White prepares an immediate kingside pawn storm.

b5, waits for the move …c7-c5, then draws his queen back to d2,
after which the d6-pawn is hanging: 10…a6 11.f3 b5 12.♕d2

But Black can nevertheless continue with his queenside attack: 12…
c6! For the sacrificed pawn he gets a lead in development and a
direct attack against the white king position: 13.♗xd6 ♗xd6
14.♕xd6 ♕a5:

B) 10.♗c4. Here, the flexible redeployment of the king’s knight is
good: 10…♘d7 11.♘d5 ♗xd5 12.♗xd5 ♗f6N 13.♕e3 (13.♕d2

15.f3 ♕e7=. Black plans …♖ad8 and …c7-c6, with a level game.
10…a6 11.g4 b5
We saw 11…♘d7 in Game 10, Berbatov-Hickl.
Black, in turn, threatens the pawn roller …c7-c5 followed by …b5-b4.
12.h4

12.♕d2 c6! We’re already familiar with this idea. Preventing the
forward march of the c-pawn with 12.♕f2 c6 13.♗xd6? fails to 13…
♗xd6 14.e5 ♘xg4! 15.fxg4 ♕g5+–+.
12…c5 13.♕d2 b4 14.♘d5
The only move. White blocks the center of the board so that he will
have a long-term space advantage, and can assault the weak d6-
pawn (♕h2).
14.♘e2? is too passive. Black gets a fierce attack with 14…♕a5
15.a3 d5! 16.g5 dxe4! 17.gxf6 ♗xf6, when there is no good defense
against the mate threat 18…♗xb2+.
14…♘xd5 15.exd5 ♗d7
The pawn fronts are well advanced, but they still need several more
moves to achieve the desired line openings. But both players have to
be careful to see to it that the gaps created by the pawn advances
cannot be exploited by the opponent.
16.♔b1
White waits with a useful king move.
16.h5 creates a gap at g5, which after 16…♖e8 17.♗d3 (17.g5
♗f5! 18.♔b1 transposes to the game) can be fixed by 17…h6!N
(17…♕c8?! 18.♖de1 ♗f8?! 19.♖xe8  1-0 (48) Badmatsyrenov-
Zude, Moscow 2015). White can find no advantageous kingside
breakthrough, and the chances are even. For example:

A) 18.♔b1 ♗b5 19.♗e4 (19.♗f5 ♗f6  ♖e2 20.♗e4) 19…♖a7
(19…a5 20.♖dg1 ♗g5 21.♗xg5 ♕xg5 22.f4 ♕f6 23.g5 hxg5
24.fxg5 ♕d4 25.♕xd4 cxd4 ) 20.♕h2 a5=;
B) 18.♖dg1♗b5 19.♗e4 ♗g5 20.♗xg5 ♕xg5 21.f4 ♕d8= and
Black is first to get to the open file.
16…♖e8?!
More precise was 16…♗b5!. Black would like to trade off an
important white attacking piece and occupy the f5-square after g4-
g5. After 17.g5 (17.♗h3 ♖e8 18.g5 ♗d7 19.♗f1 ♗f5 gives the
position after Black’s 17th move) 17…♗xf1 18.♖dxf1 ♕d7 19.♕d3
g6 20.h5 ♖fe8 21.♗c1 ♗f8 22.hxg6 fxg6= Black can neutralize the
pressure on h7 with a major piece on the seventh rank and can
prevent the advance f4-f5 with …♕d7-f5.
17.g5?!
This move has to be further prepared. Now Black occupies the f5-b1
diagonal, with the result that the white pawn storm bogs down.
With 17.♗d3! White is the first to take control of the diagonal, which
secures for him the better prospects.
17…♗f5 18.h5 ♕d7 19.♗d3
Preparing g5-g6.

After 19.h6 g6  the files on the kingside remain closed. Thanks to
the black pawn chain d6-c5-b4 (perhaps supplemented later by a
pawn advancing to a3!) White cannot direct a queen+bishop battery
against g7 and h8. Moreover, in addition to his queenside play, Black
has at his disposal the lever …f7-f6, which he can also put into effect
later on against the white kingside, which has been weakened by
the advance of the pawns. The position is entirely capable of
defense, and remains double-edged.
19…a5
Note that the bishop perseveres at e7 for as long as it can. With the
retreat to f8 it reliably protects the important d6-pawn, true, but
apart from this it remains completely passive. Activating the bishop
with …g7-g6 is out of the question as it would allow White to open
the h-file.
20.g6?
The further the pawns advance, the more squares are given up! Now
our king’s bishop can occupy the long diagonal. The opening of lines
does not further White’s prospects, since Black can give good
protection to the g6- and g7-squares.
Better was 20.♖de1 when White has the initiative. But there would
be chances for both sides:

A) 20…a4 21.h6 g6 22.♖e2 ♗f8= (22…f6? 23.♗xf5 ♕xf5
24.♖he1+–);
B) 20…♗f8 21.♗e4 a4 22.♕d3 ♗xe4 23.fxe4 b3 24.h6 bxc2+
25.♕xc2
20…fxg6 21.hxg6 hxg6 22.♖dg1 ♔f7
White’s attack has been beaten back and the black pieces are
becoming active.

Conclusion
In this game we analyzed the most important ideas involved in the
mutual pawn storms. The play is double-edged. Black has chances
both in beating back White’s kingside attack and in his counterplay
on the other wing.

Game 12
Mees van Osch 2147
Roeland Pruijssers 2558
Maastricht 2013
1.e4 e5 2.♘f3 d6 3.d4 exd4 4.♘xd4 ♘f6 5.♘c3 ♗e7
In this game we look at a few side variations. What they have in
common is that Black does not have to solve any particular problems
and with simple development reaches an acceptable game. Still, it is
good to familiarize ourselves with a few ideas.
6.♗e3
White chooses a build-up analogous to the English Attack in the
Open Sicilian. He would like, with f2-f3, ♕d2, 0-0-0 and g2-g4, to
work up a kingside attack. Black’s rapid development allows him an
immediate counter-blow in the center.
A) 6.♕f3 looks to castle queenside, and threatens with ♘f5 to cut
Black’s bishop pair in half. Black ignores both threats and gets rapid
development and a good game. After 6…0-0 7.♘f5 ♗xf5 8.♕xf5
White has made more than one move with the queen and knight,
without the queen landing on a square that would be safe for her. In
light of Black’s lead in development one fails to see what White can
do against the typical advance on the queenside with …♘bd7, …c7-
c6, …b5-b4 and finally …d6-d5: 8…♘bd7 9.♗e3 c6 10.♗e2:

analysis diagram
A1) In a game against the Russian Grandmaster Danin, the player
of the black pieces remembered the repertoire 10…b5, but quickly
played the imprudent ‘generally useful’ rook move 10…♖e8?!
without noticing that the rook takes an important retreat square
from the f6-knight. The fact that Black is short of space is not a
problem, but he has to make sure that every one of his pieces has a
good square! After 11.g4!  his difficulties began, and after further
inaccuracies the position became untenable: 11…g6 12.♕f4 d5?!
(12…♘c5) 13.g5!  ♗b4?! (13…♘xe4 14.♘xe4 dxe4 15.0-0-0 ♗f8
16.♗g4 ♖e7 17.h4 ♕e8 18.h5 ♗g7 19.hxg6 fxg6! ) 14.gxf6 ♖xe4
15.♕f3 ♗xc3+ 16.bxc3 ♕a5 17.0-0 1-0 (39) Danin-Zude, Hofheim
2015;
A2) After 10…b5 Black (in a few moves) gets in the central freeing
move …d6-d5: 11.a3 a5 12.0-0 b4 (here 12…♖e8, among other
moves, would be quite playable!) 13.axb4 axb4 14.♘a4 ♖e8!  (14…
d5=)
B) 6.♗d3 The bishop is no better placed here than on e2 or c4.
After 6…0-0 7.0-0 ♖e8 8.h3 (8.f4 d5! 9.e5 ♗c5 10.♘ce2 ♘c6 11.c3
♘e4=; 8.♗f4 ♘bd7…♗f8, …c7-c6, …♘c5 or …♘e5) 8…c6 9.♖e1
♘bd7= followed by …♘e5 White will presumably pull the bishop
back to f1, transitioning to the variation after 6.♗e2;

C) 6.♗g5?! This bishop move threatens nothing, but merely
places a piece on an unprotected square. Black could simply develop
normally with 6…h6 or 6…0-0, or even, with 6…♘xe4!?, head into
complex tactical complications that would be to his advantage (this
furnishes good practice for independent analysis):
analysis diagram
7.♗xe7 ♕xe7 8.♘d5 ♕e5! (8…♕d8 9.♗d3 ♘c5 10.♕e2+ ♘e6 )
9.♘f3 (9.♘xc7+ ♔d8–+ 10.♘xa8 ♘c3+) 9…♕xb2 10.♖b1 ♕xa2

17.♘g5 ♗e6 18.♘xe6+ fxe6 19.♘xf6 gxf6 ;
D) 6.h3 is a notable idea. White aims with g2-g4 at an extended
fianchetto and hopes thereby to improve on the variation with 6.g3:
the g4-pawn threatens to drive the knight from f6. Fortunately, this
takes quite a long time and Black can equalize comfortably through
his usual queenside play: 6…0-0
D1) 7.♘de2 b5!? (7…♖e8 and 7…c7-c6 are also playable) 8.g4?!
(≥ 8.a3) Again, an example of the fact that even strong
grandmasters, while still in the opening phase, can play uncertainly

in the seldom-occurring Antoshin Variation: 8…b4 9.♘d5 ♘xd5
10.♕xd5 c6 11.♕d2 a5 12.♗g2 ♗b7 13.0-0 ♘d7 14.♘g3 g6!
15.b3 ♕b6 16.♗b2 a4 17.♔h2:
analysis diagram
D11) 17…♖fe8 18.♖ab1 ♗f8 19.♘f5!∞;
D12) 17…axb3?! 18.axb3 ♖xa1 19.♗xa1= 1-0 (31) Berg-Hickl,
Germany 2009;
D13) Black claims the initiative with 17…a3 18.♗d4 c5 19.♗e3
♖ad8 20.♖ad1 ♖fe8 . White can hardly prevent an early …d6-d5,
while the forward march of the f-pawn would be no less dangerous
to his own king than to his opponent’s.
D2) After 7.g4 Black can open the center with the typical counter-
stroke 7…d5!: 8.e5 ♘fd7, when the restricting e5-pawn cannot be
retained:
D21) 9.♘xd5 ♘xe5 10.♗g2 (10.♘xe7+?! ♕xe7 11.♗g2 ♘d3+
12.♔f1 ♘xc1 ) 10…♗c5 11.0-0 c6 12.♘b3 ♗d6=;
D22) 9.♗g2 c6 10.♗f4 ♕b6 11.♘f5 ♖e8
E) On 6.f3 there follows 6…0-0 7.♗e3 d5!, transposing into the
variation 7.f3.
6…0-0

7.♕d2
White does well to get developed as quickly as possible.
7.f3 d5! 8.e5 c5! and after the opening of the center through the
indirect piece exchange only the first player has problems to solve:
9.♘db5 (9.exf6 ♗xf6 10.♘db5 d4 11.♘e4 transposes) 9…d4
10.exf6 ♗xf6 11.♘e4 dxe3 12.♘xf6+? (12.♕xd8 ♗xd8 ) 12…♕xf6
13.♘c7 ♕h4+ 14.g3 ♕b4+ 15.♔e2 (15.c3 ♕xb2 16.♗e2 ♕xc3+
17.♔f1 ♗h3+ 18.♔g1 ♘c6–+) 15…♘c6 16.♘xa8 ♖e8!–+
7…a6
The Dutch grandmaster aims for a complicated game.
A) 7…d5 is possible here – the play becomes simplified: 8.exd5
♘xd5 9.♘xd5 ♕xd5 10.♘b5N ♕xd2+ 11.♗xd2 ♘a6 12.0-0-0
♖d8=;
B) 7…♘g4 would only chase the bishop to a better square: 8.♗f4
8.g3
The transition to the fianchetto system is playable, but in view of the
early ♗e3 and ♕d2 Black has better chances of getting in an early
…d6-d5.
8.f3 ♘c6 9.0-0-0 is the thematic setup. Black can strive for quite
similar counterplay here with 9…♘xd4 10.♗xd4 b5 (10…♗e6 11.g4
), as we know from the 6.♗f4 variation. Here is a sample variation:
11.♔b1 ♗e6 12.g4 c5 13.♗f2 (13.♗xf6 ♗xf6 14.♕xd6? ♕a5

15.e5 ♖fd8–+) 13…b4 14.♘d5 ♘xd5 15.exd5 ♗d7, with chances
for both sides.
8…♖e8
8…c5!? 9.♘de2 ♘bd7 10.♘f4 b5= is an interesting alternative.
Black hands over the central d5-square in order to take it back again
with …♗b7 and …♘b6 followed by …b5-b4, and a general exchange
after ♘c3-d5.
9.♗g2 ♘bd7
10.0-0-0
The deployment of the bishop to g2 does not fit in with the setup
with queenside castling; the bishop stands in the way of the pawn
storm.
Better is 10.0-0. Black now has the choice of whether to pursue
more complicated play involved with the system with 6.g3, or to aim
for an early …d6-d5 with an approximately level position, e.g. with
10…♘b6 (10…♘e5!?) 11.♕e2 c6 12.♖ad1 d5 13.exd5 cxd5 14.b3
♕c7 15.♕d3 ♗g4=. The bishop move provokes f2-f3, after which a
comfortable isolated pawn position is reached.
10…♗f8?!
A minor inaccuracy that enables White to consolidate his position. It
was important to seize the initiative and to activate the d7-knight
that is standing in the way!

Black should exploit the not-yet-optimal coordination of the white
forces with the better 10…♘e5N:
A) 11.b3 ♘eg4 12.♗f4 ♘h5 13.h3 ♘xf4 14.gxf4 ♘f6 followed by
…♗f8 and …♘d7-c5. The opening of the g-file without the white
queen’s bishop is not very dangerous; g7 can easily be protected;
B) 11.♕e2 b5 12.♗f4 (12.f4 ♗g4 13.♘f3 ♘xf3 14.♗xf3 ♗xf3
15.♕xf3 b4! 16.♘d5 ♘xd5=) 12…♘fd7 13.♔b1 ♗b7
11.♗g5?!
The first player returns the compliment. The bishop is effective on
neither g5 nor f4, so Black can comfortably play …b7-b5.
The Dutch amateur could have prevented Black’s counterplay with
11.♔b1  or 11.h3  and put the grandmaster under lasting pressure.
The problem is that the knight on d7 does not have a good square.
After e.g. 11.h3 ♘e5 12.b3 ♗d7 13.♔b1, 13…b5 does not work
because of 14.♗g5! h6 15.♗xf6 ♕xf6 16.f4 ♘g6 17.♘d5 ♕d8
18.♘f5 .
11…h6 12.♗f4 ♘e5 13.♖he1 ♗d7
13…b5!? 14.♘c6!? ♕d7! 15.♘xe5 dxe5 16.♕xd7 ♗xd7  and 13…
c6!? 14.♔b1 ♕c7  would also have successfully prepared
queenside expansion.
14.♔b1

14…b5
The queenside pawn storm is especially effective against queenside
castling. By having his c3-knight driven away White loses not only
his central control – his king also comes under attack.
15.♘f5?!
15.b3 or 15.♘d5 were preferable.
15…♘c4 16.♕c1 ♘g4?!
16…♗xf5! 17.exf5 ♖xe1 18.♖xe1 d5 19.♕d1 c6  was simpler.
Black dominates in the center and on the queenside. The knight on
c3 and the bishop at g2 are hemmed in by the c6- and d5-pawns.
17.b3?
Black uses this weakness for a dangerous attack on the king.
17.f3!= offered an unexpected opportunity to shake off the pressure.
17…b4! 18.♘d5 ♘a3+ 19.♔a1 a5
 20.f3 20.♖f1 ♘xh2 21.♖h1 ♘g4–+

23.♘b6 ♖b8 24.♘a4 ♕f6–+ 22.c3? 22.g4 a4 22…a4!–+ 23.bxa4 ♗xa4

Conclusion
Black can get a good game through simple development against the
side variations at the 6th move. In the game continuation we saw a
special form of the 6.♗f4 variation, but without the kingside pawn

storm. By precise play Black can organize his typical queenside
counterplay.
Conclusion: The Antoshin Variation
The setup with …♘bd7, …♖e8, and …c7-c6, with the idea of
expanding on the queen’s wing with …b7-b5 and putting White’s
center under pressure, promises good chances for equality. We have
seen more than once that Black gets equivalent play if he finds the
right moment for his counterplay and carries this through with
energy and precision!

The ‘Morphy Variation,’ aiming for quick development. The first
player would gladly go into the Steinitz Defense in the Spanish after
5…♘c6 6.♗b5, which is not part of our repertoire. But, as will be
seen, the queen stands less than optimally in the center of the
board.
5…♗e7
We also develop quickly and drive the queen away only after castling
kingside.
6.♗g5
The young Russian grandmaster first provokes the weakening …h7-
h6 before creating threats with the development scheme ♗f4, ♕d2
(after …♘c6) and 0-0-0, very much like the system with 6.♗f4 in
the Antoshin Variation.
A) The bishop check 6.♗b5+ poses a riddle: the bishop is not
really posted well here for very long and certainly should not be

exchanged for Black’s queen’s knight. After 6…♘bd7 7.♗f4 0-0 8.0-
0 ♘c5 9.♗c4 ♘e6 10.♗xe6 ♗xe6 the game is about even (0-1
(50) Pikula-Hickl, Switzerland tt 2008);
B) 6.♗f4 is similar to the game, only without Black’s extra move
…h7-h6: 6…0-0 7.0-0-0 ♘c6 8.♕d2
analysis diagram
The position is very similar to the Antoshin Variation with 6.♗f4. We
must choose between the typical plans in that line: immediate
counter-attack on the queenside with …a7-a6 and …b7-b5, or
redeployment of the king’s knight and pressure on the white e-
pawn:
B1) We preferred 8…a6 in the Antoshin Variation, but here it
doesn’t work so well, since White can keep some advantage by
ordinary centralization: 9.♗d3 ♗e6 (blocks the e-file, which Black
needs to exert pressure on e4) 10.♔b1! (10.♘g5 b5  1-0 (46)
Krämer-Fedorovsky, 
Germany 
Bundesliga 
2014/15) 
10…♘d7
11.♘d5 ♘ce5 (11…♘c5 12.h4 ♘xd3 13.♕xd3 ) 12.♘xe5! dxe5
13.♗e3  With the pawns distributed symmetrically the initiative
weighs especially heavily: White’s active pieces make it difficult for
Black to develop his forces;

B2) 8…♘d7 9.♘d5 ♖e8N is – just like the interpolation of …h7-
h6, ♗g5-f4 – a good reaction here. Black exerts pressure on e4, as
the protection afforded by f2-f3 is lacking: 10.♗d3 (10.♗b5 a6)
10…♘c5 11.♗e3 (11.♘xe7+?! ♕xe7 ) 11…♗f8
C) 6.♗c4 ♘c6 seems less logical. The queen must either go back
to d1 or block the dark-squared bishop.
6…h6
Really surprising, for as we saw in the chapter on the Antoshin
Variation, White, after castling queenside, would have a most
dangerous plan in the advance of his kingside pawns, inasmuch as
he would now have a lever with g2-g4-g5. On the other hand, the
first player does not have the stabilizing move f2-f3 and cannot get
in g2-g4 as quickly. Still, Black cannot afford to lose time, but should
apply pressure in the center as soon as possible.
7.♗f4 0-0 8.♗e2
So now White will castle kingside. His pieces are quite well
developed, although, as before, his queen is uncomfortably placed.
After 8.0-0-0 ♘c6 9.♕d2 Black, with 9…♘d7N 10.♘d5 ♖e8
11.♗d3 ♘c5 12.♗e3 (12.♘xe7+?! ♕xe7 ) 12…♗f8 , can offer
strong resistance with an effective counter-attack on the e4-pawn.
8…a6 9.0-0 ♘c6 10.♕d3 ♖e8 11.♖ad1

11…♘d7!
This idea, which in the Antoshin Variation is not quite sufficient for
equality against White’s setup with f2-f3, here performs brilliantly:
Black attacks e4!
12.♘d5?!
White loses the thread.
He should invest a pawn with 12.♗e3 ♗f6 13.♖fe1 ♗xc3 14.♕xc3
♖xe4 15.♗c4 for good dynamic compensation. Black is solidly
positioned, but he can hardly complete his development without
making concessions.
12…♗f6?!
The highly creative Hungarian grandmaster lets the opportunity
pass.
12…♘c5!N 13.♕e3 ♗f6 14.♘xf6+ ♕xf6 15.e5 ♕g6 would have
given Black the advantage. In this variation, too, the insecure
position of White’s queen in the center of the board is noticeable, as
is the vulnerability of the e-pawn.
13.b4
Saving the pawn and planning to drive away the c6-knight.
13…a5 14.a3 axb4 15.axb4 ♘ce5 16.♘xe5 ♗xe5 17.♗xe5 dxe5
17…♘xe5 would have preserved our familiar pawn structure. After
the inevitable …c7-c6 Black would have a tough time shaking off the

pressure on d6; e.g. 18.♕c3 c6 19.♘e3 ♘g6 20.♖d4 ♕f6 21.♕d2
♘f4 22.♗d1 ♗e6 23.♖xd6 ♖ad8 24.e5 ♕g5 25.♗f3 .
18.♕c3
In this position, with a symmetrical pawn distribution, White has the
edge due to his greater activity; Rapport, however, escapes with a
draw.
18…c6 19.♘e3 ♕c7 20.b5 ♖a4?!
20…♘f6
21.bxc6 ♕xc6 22.♕b2!  ♕xe4 23.c3 b6 24.♗b5?!
≥ 24.♖d6
24…♖a7 25.♘c4 25.♖d6
½-½
Conclusion
In the Morphy Variation Black can get a good attack on the central
e4-pawn with …♘d7, …♖e8 and …♘c5.
Game 14
Jonas Lampert 2373
Dragan Solak 2598
Biel 2013
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 4.f4
An aggressive line which, however, neglects his development.

4…exd4 5.♕xd4
White is prepared to invest two tempi to be able to get in an early
f2-f4 against the Antoshin Variation. Moreover, after …♘c6 the
knight is certainly well developed, but it is not in a position to
contribute to an attack on the e4-pawn. On the other hand, there is
little danger to Black from the lever e4-e5.
5…♘c6
The retreat of the queen to a square other than d1 would now
hamper the activation of the bishop.
6.♕d1
White is developing in slow motion, which does not sit well with
f4/e4.
After 6.♗b5 ♗e7 7.♘f3 0-0 White is faced with an important
decision; a harmonious and quick development is, however, not in
sight:
A) 8.♗xc6 bxc6 9.0-0 ♖e8 White’s passive queen’s bishop and
the fact that an early e4-e5 is not dangerous for Black give the
second player an easy game. He can attack the e4-pawn with …c6-
c5 and …♗b7;
B) 8.♕d2 a6 9.♗xc6 bxc6 10.0-0 permits, among other things,
the central lever 10…d5! .
6…♗e7

Black could also opt for immediate active play here with 6…d5, but
the Antoshin setup is fully sufficient in itself, all the more so as
White’s only pawn lever for opening the game, e4-e5, would free up
Black’s king’s bishop.
7.♘f3 0-0
Black is already almost fully developed, and is ready to open the
game with …d6-d5, with the white king stationed in the middle of
the board.
8.♗c4
Preventing …d6-d5.
A) 8.♗d3 d5 9.e5 ♘g4 ;
B) 8.♗e2 d5 9.e5 (9.exd5 ♘b4 10.♗c4?! ♗f5 11.♘d4?! ♗g4 )
9…♘g4:
B1) 10.♕xd5 ♘b4 11.♕xd8 ♖xd8 ;
B2) 10.♘xd5 ♗c5 11.♖f1 ♗e6 12.♘c3 (12.c4? ♗xd5 13.cxd5
♗b4+ ) 12…♕xd1+ 13.♗xd1 f6
8…♗e6 9.♗d5
9…♗xd5
The Serbian grandmaster has certainly foreseen that in the play that
follows he can successfully combat the white center with …c7-c6.
The regrouping …♘d7 followed by …♗f6 and …♖e8, already
familiar to us, is playable here as well: 9…♘d7 10.0-0 ♗f6 and now:

A) 11.♕d3 permits 11…♘b4 12.♕c4 ♘xd5! (12…♘xc2?
13.♗xe6 fxe6 14.♖b1! ) 13.♘xd5 ♖e8! 14.♕xc7 ♗xd5 15.♕xd8
♗xd8 16.exd5 ♗b6+ 17.♔h1 ♖ac8 18.c3 ♘f6 , when Black will
win back the sacrificed pawn. After this, White’s queen, by reason of
the f4-pawn, would not cut a good figure;
B) 11.♗xe6 fxe6 12.♗e3 ♗xc3 13.bxc3 ♕e8. Here it is unclear
whether White’s space advantage would compensate over the long
term for his catastrophic pawn structure.
10.exd5 ♘b4 11.a3
Otherwise it is still easier for Black to play …c7-c6.
11.0-0 c6 12.dxc6 bxc6=
11…♘a6 12.0-0
12.♘d4 ♕d7 13.♕f3 ♖fc8!? followed by …c7-c6 or …c7-c5.
Now Black calls his opponent’s control of d5 into question.
12…c6!= 13.♘d4 ♕d7
13…♘xd5 14.♘xd5 cxd5= Naturally the ‘extra pawn’ does not
represent any particular value here; the bad white queen’s bishop
and the fine square e4 for the knight give the second player a good
game.
14.♕f3 c5
Solak goes into a symmetrical Benoni structure. Because of the
exchange at d5 he doesn’t have a problem finding a place for his

light-squared bishop, and all his pieces have good squares.
The d5-pawn, on the other hand, will tend to be at least as weak as
the pawn on d6.
14…♗d8 15.dxc6 bxc6 16.♘xc6 ♗b6+ 17.♔h1 ♖ac8 18.♘b4
♘xb4 19.axb4 d5
15.♘de2 ♘c7 16.f5 b5 17.♗g5?!
The up-and-coming young German player would like to compensate
for the loss of the d5-pawn with active play on the kingside, and
almost succeeds in this.
It was better to support the important central d5-pawn; e.g. 17.b4
a5 18.♖b1 ♖fe8 19.♔h1 h6 20.h3 axb4 21.axb4 ♗f8 22.♘g3∞.
17…♘fxd5
He grabs the pawn right away, thereby allowing White a hidden
attacking possibility.
17…♖fe8! 18.♖fd1 (18.♖ad1 a5 ) 18…♘cxd5 19.♘xd5 ♘xd5
20.♗xe7 ♕xe7 21.♖xd5 ♕xe2  would have won a pawn for only
insufficient compensation.
18.♘xd5 ♘xd5
19.♗h6?!
The shattered black pawn structure is mitigated by the bishop that
will come to f6.

The difficult-to-find thrust 19.f6! would have maximized White’s
piece activity. The pressure down the f-file as well as his active
minor pieces after ♘g3-f5(h5) give White sufficient compensation
for the pawns. Black must defend carefully here: 19…♘xf6 20.♘g3
♔h8 (20…♘g4 21.♘f5! ♗xg5 22.♕xg4 ♕d8  23.♖ad1 g6
24.♘xd6 ♗f6 25.♘f5 ) 21.♖ad1 ♖ae8 22.♘f5 ♖g8 23.♗xf6
♗xf6 24.♖xd6 ♕c7 25.♘h6 ♕e7 26.♘xg8 ♕xd6 27.♘xf6 ♕d4+
28.♕f2 gxf6 29.♕xd4 cxd4 30.♖xf6 ♔g7=
19…gxh6 20.♕xd5 ♗f6
Black is up a pawn and later can use his bishop to exploit the white
kingside, which was weakened by f2-f4. In contrast, the knight,
headed to h5, will not pose any decisive threats. Black stands better
and in the course of the game can make progress against tenacious
resistance, although he will have to do so in a difficult rook
endgame.

Conclusion
In the aggressive variation with 4.f4 and 5.♕xd4, too, the early
development of the queen is shown to be sub-optimal. Black, with
purposeful play, can threaten the central lever …d6-d5. After the
exchange of the light-squared bishops on d5 there arises a typical
situation in which White’s space advantage does not make much of
an impact, since all of Black’s pieces are well developed.

Game 15
Alexander Moiseenko 2707
Fabiano Caruana 2791
Dubai Wch Rapid 2014
We don’t usually make reference to games played at a fast time
limit, but here we make an exception, as top GM Fabiano Caruana
demonstrates an interesting idea.
1.d4 d6 2.e4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5
4.♘ge2
Moiseenko would like to fianchetto his bishop without blocking the
advance of his f-pawn. As long as Black maintains his pawn on e5
the knight remains very passive here, and it can be activated only
with enormous expenditure of time.
A) After 4.♗g5 h6 5.♗h4 there are two good plans available:
A1) The first is the build-up that we are familiar with from the
variations 3.♗d3 and 3.♘d2: 5…♘bd7 6.♘f3 ♗e7 7.♗e2 c6 8.0-0
0-0 9.h3 ♖e8 is quite playable. The development of White’s queen’s
bishop to the kingside is rather counter-productive here. For
example, after 10.♗g3 ♕b6 the absence of the queenside bishop
makes a negative impression. Furthermore, both the exchange of
the black king’s bishop (after …♘f6-h5) as well as of the king’s

knight (after ♗h4-g3, …♘f6-h5-f4) are from Black’s point of view
rather to be striven for;
A2) 5…exd4 6.♕xd4 g5: the ‘expanded fianchetto’ of the king’s
bishop. In this line, Black must of course take care to see that his
weaknesses at h5 and f5 cannot be exploited: 7.♗g3 ♗g7 and now:
A21) 8.0-0-0!?N In response to this Black should look to castle on
the queen’s wing, since otherwise White would get an attack against
Black’s weakened kingside. For example, 8…♘h5 9.♕e3 ♘c6 10.f3
♘xg3 11.hxg3 ♕f6 12.♗c4 ♗d7∞;
A22) 8.♗b5+ ♘c6 9.♕d2 ♘h5 10.♘ge2 ♗e6 11.0-0 (11.0-0-0
♕f6 12.f3 ♘xg3 13.♘xg3 h5!∞) 11…0-0 12.♖ad1 a6 13.♗a4 ♘a5
½-½ Sokolov-Hickl, Switzerland tt 2008.
B) 4.♗c4 gives us a welcome tempo for development: 4…exd4
5.♕xd4 ♘c6=
4…♗e7
Caruana completes his development quickly and aims at early
counterplay after castling with …b7-b5.
4…exd4 5.♘xd4 ♗e7 would take us into the Antoshin Variation.
5.g3
White can of course play this way and get a solid position. But for
the present he poses no threat to his opponent; the attacking plan
0-0, h2-h3, g3-g4, ♘e2-g3 and f2-f4 is rather long-winded.

A) 5.f3 0-0 6.♗e3 exd4 (6…c6 7.♕d2 b5∞) 7.♘xd4 d5 leads by
transposition to the system with 6.♗e3 in the Antoshin Variation,
which we analyzed in Chapter 2;
B) 5.f4 0-0! 6.dxe5 dxe5 7.♕xd8 ♗xd8 8.fxe5 ♘g4 9.♘d4 ♘xe5
10.♗f4 ♘bd7=;
C) After 5.d5 c6 6.f3 Black can hamper White’s development with
6…♕b6!?. Here the first player has a bad form of this center
transformation – the c-pawn belongs on c4.
5…0-0 6.♗g2 c6 7.0-0
After 7.a4 a5 8.0-0 ♘a6 too Black has no problems. Since the
exchange on e5 is useful only to him, he can leave the choice open
for a while whether to go into the well-known structure of the
Antoshin Variation with …exd4 and …♘a6-c5, or maintain the pawn
at e5.
7…b5!
In the Antoshin Variation we often have to struggle to achieve this
natural counter-action with tricky and laborious play. However, in this
situation it is readily available to us. The c3-knight is destabilized
and cannot retreat to e2, as its colleague is stationed there. White
must therefore already play carefully to avoid finding himself at a
disadvantage.
8.a3 ♘bd7 9.h3 a5 10.g4 ♗a6

The bishop arrives to disrupt the a6-f1 diagonal just in time. Without
this intervention, White could maintain his harmonious build-up after
♘g3.
11.♘g3 exd4! 12.♕xd4 b4! 13.♘ce2 d5
Our familiar queenside pawn storm has enabled Black to get in the
advance …d6-d5.
13…bxa3 followed by …d6-d5 is also very strong.
14.e5?
The Ukrainian grandmaster overlooks a hidden tactical finesse,
typical in speed chess.
Accepting the pawn offer would cede a strong initiative to Black’s
bishop pair. Here is a sample variation: 14.axb4 axb4 15.exd5 ♘xd5
16.♗xd5 ♗c5! (16…cxd5 17.♕xd5 ♗f6 18.♖d1! ♘e5! 19.♕xd8
♘f3+! 20.♔g2 ♘h4+ 21.♔g1 ♘f3+=) 17.♗xf7+ ♖xf7 18.♕e4
♖e7 19.♗g5! ♖xe4 20.♗xd8 ♖e8 21.♗g5 (21.♗c7 ♘f6 ) 21…
♘e5
14…♗xe2 15.♘xe2 ♗c5 16.♕f4 ♘xe5!
Black gets the piece back, after which his well-protected central
pawn promises him the best winning chances.
17.♕xe5 ♖e8 18.♕f5 ♖xe2 19.♗g5 bxa3 20.bxa3 ♕d6 21.♗xf6

21…gxf6!
Since White’s king’s bishop cannot get to the d3-h7 diagonal quickly
enough, the weakness of the black kingside is unimportant. The
black queen, on the other hand, is posted so that she is active on
both sides of the board.
After 21…♕xf6?! 22.♕xf6 gxf6 23.c4 White’s chances of saving
himself would be enhanced. The fact that his king would no longer
be threatened by the queen and bishop would relieve him of
considerable worry.
22.♔h1
≥ 22.c4
22…♖b8 23.♖ae1 ♖xe1 24.♖xe1 ♗xa3
Now the passed a-pawn is decisive, though Moiseenko continues to
defend with ingenuity:
25.c4 ♕b4 26.♖g1 ♕xc4 27.g5 ♕h4 28.gxf6 ♔h8 29.♗f3 ♗b2 30.♖g7
♗xf6 31.♖xf7 ♗g7 32.♖c7 ♖f8 33.♖c8 ♕e7 34.♗e2 34.♗d1 34…♖xc8
35.♕xc8+ ♗f8 36.♗d3 ♕f6 37.♔g2? 37.♗c2  37…a4–+ 38.♕a8 a3
39.♔f1 ♔g7 40.♕a4 ♗c5 41.♕g4+ ♔h6 42.♗f5 ♕g5 43.♕f3 a2
0-1
Conclusion
Against the variation 4.♘ge2, Black can either go into the Antoshin
Variation or retain the e5-pawn and work up his typical queenside
counterplay with …c7-c6 and …b7-b5.

Game 16
Andrei Istratescu 2677
Erik Zude 2366
Basel 2014
1.d4 d6 2.e4 ♘f6 3.f3
With this seemingly modest move White aims for an ambitious
setup. After our…
3…e5
he will protect the d4-pawn with…
4.♘e2
and would like to develop his pieces quite in the style of the Sämisch
Variation in the King’s Indian: ♗e3, ♕d2, c2-c4, ♘c3 and,
preferably, 0-0-0 and g2-g4, with a dangerous attack against Black’s
king position. In an ideal (for White!) world, despite …g7-g6, he
would sacrifice his knight and blow through with a mating attack.
But Black can offer resistance with the quick development of his
king’s bishop to e7. It is important to pose problems for the first
player on both sides of the board: on the kingside with …h7-h5 and
on the queenside with …c7-c6. In an ideal world from Black’s point
of view, White will not succeed in consolidating his space advantage.
A) 4.d5 pursues a similar approach. Here too, thanks to his rapid
development, Black can attack the enemy pawn chain or go into the

game continuation by transposition:

Endgame Variation in Chapter 1, White has not developed his
queen’s knight to c3, where it stands inactive after an early …c7-c6,
but has instead supported his king’s pawn with the slow f2-f3. Hence
Black has time for …♘bd7 followed by …♔e7; e.g. 7.♗e3 ♘bd7
8.♘d2 ♗c5 9.♔f2 ♔e7=, when, despite the exchange of queens
and the symmetry, a game quite rich in content lies ahead.
4…♗e7 5.♗e3 0-0 6.c4
This is an integral component of White’s setup.
A) 6.d5 c6! transposes to the variation 4.d5 ♗e7 5.♗e3 0-0;
B) 6.♘bc3 Without c2-c4 Black finds it easier to get counterplay
on the queenside: 6…c6 7.g4 ♘bd7 8.♘g3 exd4 9.♗xd4 (9.♕xd4?!
d5! ) 9…b5  10.♘f5?! ♘b6 11.♘xe7+ ♕xe7  The g2-g4 advance
stands in contradiction to White’s neglected development. Black will
attack the white center with …b5-b4 and …d6-d5.

6…c6 7.♘bc3 ♘bd7 8.d5
The immediate closing of the center is in this case an obvious
necessity – otherwise Black could open the center!
8.♕d2?! d5! The many unnecessary pawn moves, especially f2-f3
and c2-c4, White’s cumbersome development (♘e2), and the unsafe
position of the white king give Black a dangerous initiative after this
position-opening lever. Here is a sample variation: 9.cxd5 cxd5
10.exd5 exd4 11.♗xd4 ♘b6  12.♗xb6 ♕xb6 13.0-0-0 ♖d8 14.♕c2
g6 15.♘g3 ♗b4 16.♕b3 ♗xc3 17.♕xb6 axb6 18.bxc3 ♖xa2
19.♘e4 ♘xe4 20.fxe4 ♗g4
8…cxd5
I would have postponed this exchange, which only spurs on White’s
game on the right side of the board. Since White can hardly capture
on c6, the increased flexibility in and of itself would favor Black. In a
few cases Black can play …c6-c5 (too passive) or he can open up the
queenside in gambit style with…b7-b5. But more often it will be
shown to be very useful that the simple …a7-a6 cannot be answered
by a2-a4 so long as Black has not exchanged on d5. With a white
pawn on c4, then …a6-a5, when the squares b4 and c5 are firmly in
Black’s hands and White does not have the c4- and b5-squares
available to him.

A) 8…h5!N is a promising improvement, Black first of all
preventing the impending expansion g2-g4 and at the same time
keeping open all possibilities on the queenside. Let us examine the
typical ideas a bit more deeply:
A1) 9.♘g3 Here the knight stands poorly after 9…g6. In contrast
to the line where White gets in g2-g4, White’s attacking chances on
the kingside are here very limited:
A11) 10.♕d2 h4 11.♘ge2 ♘b6 12.b3 cxd5 13.cxd5 White has
consolidated his space advantage, but he cannot stop Black from
using the cleared h7-square with 13…♘h7! (13…a5?! 14.♘b5 ) to
play …♗g5: 14.a4 ♗g5 15.a5 ♘d7 16.♘c1 (16.♗xg5 ♘xg5) 16…
♘c5  Black has good play on both sides of the board, e.g. 17.b4
♘a6;
A12) 10.♗d3 ♘c5 11.♗c2 h4 12.♘ge2 cxd5 13.cxd5 ♘h7 14.0-
0 ♗g5 15.♗f2 ♗d7 16.b4 ♘a6
analysis diagram
In this position Black should carefully avoid the …f7-f5 advance,
since after that move his kingside play could proceed only with
difficulty. The maneuver …♘h7-f6-h5(-f4), on the other hand,
improves his position without making any moves that are too
committal.

A2) 9.♘c1 h4 10.♕d2 (10.♘d3 cxd5 11.cxd5 ♘h5 12.♕d2 f5!
13.exf5 ♘b6 14.♘f2 ♗xf5) 10…cxd5 11.cxd5 ♘h7 . Black is ready
for …f7-f5 followed by exf5, …♘b6 and …♗xf5. The exchange of
dark squares by means of …♗e7-g5 is also in the air, as long as the
d6-pawn is not subject to any further danger;
A3) 9.♕d2 h4 and now:
A31) 10.0-0-0 ♘b6 11.b3 ♘fd7 12.g3 a5  13.a4 ♘c5 14.♗xc5
dxc5 15.♔b1 ♗g5 16.f4 ♗h6 17.dxc6 ♕xd2 18.♖xd2 bxc6 19.♖d6
♗d7∞. Black’s good control of the dark squares, the bishop pair,
and possibilities for opening the position compensate for his poor
pawn structure;
A32) 10.♘c1 cxd5 and now:
A321) 11.♘xd5 ♘xd5 12.cxd5 (12.♕xd5?! ♘b6 13.♕d2 f5 )
12…f5 13.exf5 ♘b6 14.g4 hxg3 15.hxg3 ♗xf5  Black must of
course keep a close eye on the dangers down the h-file. That said,
the white king is quite vulnerable in the center;
A322) 11.cxd5 ♘h7 12.♗e2 (12.♗d3 ♘c5 13.♗c2 ♗g5 14.♘d3
♘xd3+ 15.♗xd3 ♗xe3 16.♕xe3 f5 ) 12…f5 13.exf5 ♘b6
B) 8…♘e8, in comparison, is too passive. White can hold on to
his space advantage without having to worry about counterplay.
9.♕d2 g6 10.0-0-0  c5 11.♔b1 f5?! 12.exf5 gxf5 13.f4  1-0 (42)
Istratescu-E.Hansen, Basel 2013 (13.g4!?).
9.cxd5 h5 10.♕d2

10…a6
Here this move is a loss of time, and at the same time results in a
permanent weakening of Black’s queenside. And in the case of White
castling queenside, …a7-a6 is of no help in creating counterplay.
White, after ♘c1-d3, will always be well equipped to counter …b7-
b5. Then, too, the b6-square is very weak and in the game
continuation leads to a crippling of Black’s pieces: Black can bring his
queen’s rook and bishop into play only with the help of special
measures (a pawn sacrifice, for example).
It was better to play 10…h4.
11.♘c1
Both on c1 and on d3 the knight is amazingly flexible. From c1 it can
go back (after ♗d3) to e2, or it can go to b3 or d3.
11.♘g3 was also quite possible: 11…g6 12.♗d3
11…♘e8
Too passive and inflexible. 11…h4 offered more chances for
counterplay, even if White, after 12.♘d3 ♘h7 13.0-0-0 f5 , had the
better prospects.
12.a4!
A strong and simple solution for White. It prevents Black from
unfolding his queenside and flags the b6-square as a weakness.
12…g6?!
At this point I was out of ideas. With 12…b6 13.b4 or 12…a5 with
the idea …♘e8-c7-a6-b4(c5), White’s advantage could have been
held within bounds.
13.a5

What has happened is precisely what should not have occurred:
White has strengthened the e4-d5-pawn chain without Black having
any counterplay or stable squares for (all!) his pieces – which,
confined to the back rank, stand in each other’s way. The Romanian
grandmaster now has the game firmly in his grip and refuses to let
himself become confused by my hapless attempts to complicate the
game.

Conclusion
The setup with 3.f3 must be taken very seriously. White strives for a
clear space advantage. The analysis shows that Black, with precise
and flexible play, gets good chances for counterplay on both sides of
the board.
Game 17
Zhu Chen 2461
Alexander Grischuk 2795
Tromsø ol 2014
1.d4 d6 2.e4 ♘f6 3.♗d3

The leading Russian GM responds to the modest development of the
bishop by the former women’s World Champion from China with a
direct counter-strike in the center. But since transpositions to the
variation 3.♘d2 may arise, in which the direct …d6-d5 is not good, it
makes sense after 3.♗d3 as well to choose the simple setup with …
♗e7, …0-0, …♘bd7, …c7-c6 and …♕c7, as we examine in Game
18, Gedajlovic-Arizmendi Martinez. This would save the reader from
having to learn the variations shown here.
3…e5 4.c3 d5
Black can instead go into the simple setup 4…♘bd7 5.♘f3 ♗e7 (5…
d5!?) 6.0-0 0-0 7.♘bd2; see the next game.
5.dxe5 ♘xe4 6.♘f3
White relies on simple development and the constricting effect of the
e5-pawn.
Black need not fear the exchange on e4 – he gets the two bishops
and a very good game on the light squares; e.g. 6.♗xe4 dxe4
7.♕xd8+ ♔xd8 8.♗g5+?! (≥ 8.♘d2 ♘c6 ) 8…♗e7 9.♗xe7+

6…♘c6 7.♘bd2 ♘c5

8.♗c2
Probably best. The bishop does not stand in the way of protecting
the e5-pawn with ♖e1 and is meanwhile aimed in the direction of
the black kingside.
A) 8.♗b1 ♗g4 9.b4 (9.0-0 d4 10.cxd4 ♘xd4∞) 9…♘e6 10.♕a4
a6!=N (10…♕d7?? 11.b5!+– 1-0 (34) Bologan-Cuenca Jimenez,

♕xd1 13.♖xd1 ♘e6 14.♗e3 ♗e7  ½-½ (26) Popovic-Chernin,
Moscow 1994;
B2) With 8…♘d7N Black tries to force the exchange of White’s
king’s bishop by pressuring the e5-pawn; he should then be able to
maintain a rough equality. Here is a sample variation: 9.♗b5 ♗e7
10.0-0 0-0 11.♖e1 a6 12.♗d3 ♘c5 13.♗c2 ♗g4 14.♘b3 ♘e6
15.♕d3 g6 16.h3 ♗f5 17.♕e2 ♗xc2 18.♕xc2 ♖e8 19.♗h6 ♕d7
20.♖ad1 ♖ad8 21.♕d2
8…♗g4 9.h3
The second player would like to simplify the game with …d5-d4. The
text and the next move work to counteract this.
9.0-0 ♗e7 10.♖e1 d4!=
9…♗h5

10.b4?!
White drives away the irksome knight, but at the same time loosens
his pawn structure perceptibly. On the one hand this gives White the
lever …a7-a5, and on the other the c3-pawn is overloaded, having to
protect both d4 and b4.
A) 10.0-0 ♗e7 11.♖e1 d4!=;
B) Probably best here was 10.♘b3 ♘e6 11.g4 ♗g6 12.♗f5!; e.g.
12…♕d7 13.♗e3 a5 14.♕d3 .
10…♘e6 11.♗a4
The concessions wrung from White for his protection of e5 are too
great.
11.g4 ♗g6 12.♗f5! was still better.
11…♗e7
11…a5! would have activated the rook right away.
12.♗xc6+?!
The c6-pawn that White wants to win will not balance the activity
gained by the black bishop pair after the opening of the game with
…a7-a5.
With 12.g4 ♗g6 13.♘b3 0-0 (13…h5?! 14.♘a5! ) 14.0-0 a5!  White
could still retain an approximate equality.
12…bxc6 13.♕a4

13…0-0!
In view of the over-stretched and poorly developed white position,
the world-class player sacrifices a pawn and activates the rest of his
pieces.
14.♕xc6 a5 15.♘d4
The women’s ex-World Champion gives back the extra pawn, but she
can no longer hold off the collapse of the white position.
After 15.b5? ♘f4!–+ the numerous weaknesses can no longer be
protected; e.g. 16.0-0 ♖b8! 17.♕a6 ♖b6 18.♕xa5 ♖g6!.
15…axb4 16.♘2b3 bxc3 17.0-0 ♘xd4 18.♘xd4 ♗g6 19.♖d1 ≥ 19.♕xc3
c5 20.♘c6 d4!  19…♕c8 19…♕e8! 20.♕xc3 c5 21.♘b5 ♖a4 22.♘d6
♗xd6 23.exd6 d4 24.♕g3 ♕c6 25.♗f4 d3 26.♖dc1 c4 27.♖c3 ♕d5
28.♕e3 f6 29.a3 ♖e8 30.♕f3 ♕xf3 31.gxf3 ♗f7 32.♖b1 ♖d8 33.♔f1 g5

♖b5 40.♖xe6 ♔xe6 41.♖xc4 ♖b2 42.♗g3 ♖e2+
0-1
Conclusion
In the 3.♗d3 variation, after the early central advance …d6-d5 a
tense game arises, in which after e4-e5 the advanced white pawn
creates chances and risks for both sides.
The system we now consider can be reached in our repertoire after
both 1.e4 and 1.d4. Our setup can be compared with the Breyer
Variation in the Spanish.

Parenthesis: comparison with the Spanish Breyer Variation

♘bd7 11.♘bd2
analysis diagram
White can take the initiative on the queenside at any time with the
lever a2-a4. In contrast with the Breyer Variation, however, we do
not (after …♖e8) fianchetto our king’s bishop with …♗f8, …g7-g6
and …♗g7 but instead continue with …♘d7-f8-g6.
A typical line in our d6-repertoire is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘d2 e5 4.c3
♗e7. Here, instead of 5.♘gf3, which leads to Game 18, Gedajlovic-
Arizmendi Martinez, White, with 5.♗d3 0-0 6.♘e2 (6.♘gf3
transposes to the game), can keep the path of the f-pawn open.

analysis diagram
After 6…♘bd7 7.0-0 we continue with 7…c6 (7…d5 8.exd5 exd4
9.♘xd4 ♘e5 10.♗c2  ½-½ (40) Nepomniachtchi-Bachin, Vladimir
2002). White is in a position to attack the black center, so there
follows 8.f4 (8.♘f3 ♕c7 9.♖e1 ♖e8 10.♘g3 transposes to the
variation 9.♘f1 ♕c7 10.♘g3 in the game continuation) 8…c5 9.fxe5
dxe5 10.d5 ♘g4 11.♘c4 b5 12.♘e3 ♘df6 13.♘xg4 ♗xg4 with
about even chances. Black tries for …c5-c4 followed by exchanging
the king’s bishop with …♗c5 and transferring his knight to the fine
blockading square d6 (♘f6-e8-d6).
White can also combine the ♗d3 setup with an early f2-f4, after
which Black should attack the enemy center without delay; for
example:
1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♗d3 e5 4.c3 ♗e7 5.f4 ♘bd7
A) 6.♕e2 ♘f8!? 7.f5 (7.♘f3 exf4 8.♗xf4 ♘g6) 7…♘8d7=;

1.d4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.♘bd2 ♘bd7 4.e4 e5 5.c3 ♗e7
Another move sequence to this position is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.♘d2
e5 4.c3 ♗e7 5.♘gf3 ♘bd7.
6.♗d3 0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.♖e1 ♖e8
This is the stem position of the simple and universal setup with …
♗e7, …♘bd7 and …c7-c6. The formations on both sides are similar,
but it is White who has managed to first establish the pawn pair
e4/d4. This should guarantee him a slight initiative. But going
forward, it is not easy to achieve a concrete advantage.
White, on his own, is hardly able to expand his space advantage,
since d4-d5 is not possible at the moment. In other respects, too,
the first player does not have a lever that puts Black under pressure.
This distinguishes this position from the analogous line in the
Spanish Breyer Variation, in which Black neutralizes the pressure of
the ♗b5 by means of …a7-a6 and a later …b7-b5, which gives
White the lever a2-a4. In contrast to the Breyer Variation, however,
we prefer after …♖e8 the maneuver …♘df8-g6 instead of the
typical …♗f8 followed by …g7-g6 and …♗g7.
9.♕b3!?

White (successfully) disturbs his opponent’s further build-up with …
♕c7 and …♘d7-f8-g6.
After the much more often played 9.♘f1 ♕c7 10.♘g3 ♘f8 it
gradually becomes obvious that White has quite a good game, but
that it is not so easy for him to strengthen his position:
A) The direct attempt 11.♘f5 ♗xf5 12.exf5 exd4 13.cxd4
(13.♘xd4 d5 ) 13…d5 gives the first player the worse pawn
structure, without promising him any concrete chances on the
kingside;
B) 11.h3 ♘g6 12.♗e3 h6 13.♕d2 ♗f8
analysis diagram
It is true that Black has little space, but his pieces are solidly and
harmoniously placed. On the queenside the chances are about even;
in the center and on the kingside it is not so easy for White to make
progress: 14.b3 a5 15.a4 ♗d7 16.♖ad1 ♖ad8 17.♕c1. Here, 17…
b5  offers good counterplay on the queenside (17…♗c8 18.♗c2
♘h7 19.c4 ♗e7 20.♘f1 ♘h4 21.♘1h2 ♘f8 22.♘xh4 ½-½
Fedorov-Sargissian, Batumi 2002).
9…♗f8
The Spanish grandmaster prefers a formation different from the one
we favor, but it is just as playable.

The repertoire move is 9…♕c7. Black need not fear the impending
attack on f7: 10.♗c4 (10.♘g5 d5 11.exd5 cxd5 12.♘de4 exd4
13.♘xf6+ ♘xf6 14.cxd4=) 10…♖f8. White will not be able to
maintain the battery of queen and bishop. After the retreat of the
queen or bishop we return to our standard setup with …♖e8 and …
♘f8; e.g. 11.a4 (11.♘g5 d5) 11…a5 12.♗d3 (12.♘f1?! ♘xe4) 12…
h6 13.h3 ♖e8 14.♕c2 (14.♘f1 d5!=) 14…♘f8 15.♘f1 ♘g6
16.♘g3 ♗f8 etc.
10.a4
10.♘g5 d5!=
10…♘h5?!
Black pursues active play on the kingside. But his queen is
precariously placed on f6, making his undertaking a risky one.
After 10…a5 the chances would remain about even.
11.♘f1 h6 12.♗d2 ♕f6 13.♘g3 ♘f4 14.♗xf4 ♕xf4 15.♖ad1 g6

16.a5
White can expose the poor position of the queen with 16.h4! : 16…
♘f6 (16…h5? 17.♘g5 ♗h6 18.♘f5! ♗xg5 19.g3 ♕g4 20.♗e2 ♕h3

much like the 16.h4 variation;
B) 16…♖b8 17.h4!  was better.
17.♗c4
White misses his last chance to reveal the darker side of the black
queen sortie. From this point the grandmaster takes matters in hand
and outplays his opponent.

Conclusion
The simple and universal setup with …♗e7, …♘bd7, …0-0, …c7-c6
and …♖e8 is quite effective against the white pawn duo e4/d4

supported by c2-c3. It is true that White has a slight initiative, but it
is difficult to build on this, so Black has about equal chances in a
complex middlegame position.
In the following game we analyze two lines with an early f2-f4 that
are especially popular among adherents of the King’s Gambit. Our
repertoire discusses 1.e4 d6 2.f4 ♘f6 and now:
A) 3.e5 is a very rare sideline. Black can (and must!) energetically
contest the hasty central push: 3…dxe5 4.fxe5 ♘d5 5.d4 ♗f5! (5…
c5 is clearly more complicated):
A1) 6.c4?! ♘b4 7.♘a3 ♘8c6 8.♘f3 e6 . White’s pieces are
passive and have difficulty defending the over-extended center;
A2) 6.♘f3 e6  followed by …c7-c5. White’s center is a rewarding
object of attack and poses no danger to Black.
B) 3.♘c3
analysis diagram
Here you can choose – it is a matter of taste – between the very
concrete 3…d5, which leads to an (almost) equal endgame, and the
more flexible 3…e5, which formally is classed with the King’s Gambit
and to which in the course of play it generally leads:

B1) After the immediate central counter-thrust 3…d5 4.e5 (4.exd5
♘xd5 is not problematic; the first player cannot prevent …c7-c5,
when Black has better control of the center) 4…d4, the game
develops in a more or less forced way:
B11) 5.♘ce2 ♘h5!? 6.d3 (6.♘f3 c5 leads to an unbalanced
structure with about even chances for both sides) 6…c5 (Black has
as much space as White) 7.c4?! (≥ 7.♘f3; 7.c3 g6!= protecting the
h5-knight!) 7…♘c6 8.♘g3 ♘xg3 9.hxg3 g6 10.♗d2 f6! 11.exf6

♗xg7 9.0-0-0
analysis diagram
gives an endgame in which White maintains a razor-thin advantage.
The second player nevertheless has a fully adequate game, and
already on his next move has a choice among five more or less
equally good lines: 9…♘c6, 9…♗e6, 9…♗g4, 9…♘d7 or 9…♗f5.
The play is double-edged – the better player will win.

B2) 3…e5 4.♗c4 (4.♘f3 ♗e7 transposes to the note discussing
2.f4 in the next game) 4…♗e7, transposing to the following game.

1.e4 e5 2.♘c3
After 2.f4 d6, with transposition of moves, we arrive at the game
continuation. A provocation – Black defends himself with 2…d6
against the King’s Gambit! Theory treats this variation very shabbily,
which may be due to the fact that according to the theory of the
main variations White is under pressure, so there is no reason for
Black to react with a comparatively passive side variation.
Nevertheless: the build-up that we are learning in this game is sound
and White gets at best a slight advantage in a position that he
probably doesn’t know especially well.
3.♘f3 ♘f6 4.♘c3
analysis diagram

So far, so good. Now, in the fine, 650-page standard work on the
King’s Gambit by John Shaw, our repertoire move 4…♗e7 isn’t
mentioned even once! Devotees of the King’s Gambit must, amid a
wealth of variations, arm themselves against attempts to refute the
opening, and there is little room left over for studying the restrained
black formations (Shaw analyzes 4…♘bd7 etc. to a white
advantage).
A) The justification for the pawn sacrifice is shown in the variation
5.fxe5 dxe5 6.♘xe5 ♘xe4= 7.♘xe4 (7.♘xf7?? is tempting, but
after 7…♗h4+! 8.g3 ♘xg3! 9.♘xd8 ♘xh1+ 10.♔e2 ♗g4+ Black
wins a piece!) 7…♕d4 8.d3 ♕xe5 9.♗e2 ♗e6 10.0-0 ♘c6 11.c3 0-
0-0 12.♕c2 (12.♗f4 ♕d5 Black threatens …♖he8 and the advance
of the kingside pawns) 12…♖he8=. Black’s piece pressure in the
center keeps the white pawn majority in check. Both sides have
chances; e.g. 13.d4 ♕d5 14.♗f3 ♕d7 15.♖f2 h6∞ with the idea …
f7-f5 and …g7-g5;
B) 5.d4 exd4 6.♕xd4 ♘c6 proceeds along lines similar to Game
14, Lampert-Solak;
C) 5.♗c4 0-0 6.d3 leads after 6…♘c6 to the main game, and
after 6…♘bd7 7.0-0 c6 to the variation 5…0-0.
2…♘f6 3.♗c4 ♗e7 4.f4 d6 5.♘f3
The starting position in this system.

White’s setup is sound and in fact looks very imposing. After d2-d3
and 0-0 all White’s pieces point to the kingside and the lever f4xe5
gives the first player a three-fold advantage: through this exchange
he gets a central pawn majority, the rook on f1 benefits from a half-
open f-file, and his queen’s bishop has an open diagonal.
These optically promising features lead many white players to
evaluate the position too optimistically, for White is basing his game
principally on the pressure of his king bishop on the black king
position.
How would matters be if he had to give up this bishop? This is the
essential point of our scheme of development: we neutralize the c4-
bishop, either through the exchange …♘c6-a5xc4, which the very
experienced Lithuanian grandmaster in fact carries out in the main
game, or with …♘bd7-c5 and then …♗e6 or …d6-d5.
5…♘c6
The knight’s route by way of d7 is somewhat circuitous, but possible
all the same: 5…0-0 6.d3 ♘bd7 7.0-0 c6
analysis diagram
Black threatens …b7-b5 followed by …♘d7-c5 and the exchange of
the king’s bishop. We do not see how White might get an advantage
here:

A) 8.♕e1 White would like to engage the queen in the attack. But
this is nipped in the bud before it can get under way: 8…exf4
9.♗xf4 b5N 10.♗b3 ♘c5  11.d4 (11.♘d4 ♕b6 12.♔h1 ♘xb3
13.♘xb3 ♗e6 ) 11…♘xb3 12.axb3 ♕b6∞;
B) 8.♔h1 is likewise too slow: 8…b5 9.♗b3 ♕c7 10.a3 (10.♗e3
♘g4) 10…♘c5 11.♗a2 a5N 12.♕e1 ♗e6=;
C) 8.f5?! This manner of ‘closing up the center followed by an
early, large-scale advance on the kingside’ is surprisingly frequent
among club players. The mistake lies in the fact that the center is
closed only for White! Black always has the lever available by which
he gets an advantage. After …d6-d5 White must either manage with
a pawn weakness on e4 or grant his opponent the duo e5/d5; of the
fine king’s bishop on the b3-f7 diagonal nothing will then be said.
This is an example of Nimzowitsch’s rule that a flank attack can be
initiated only if one has a secure center. After 8…b5 9.♗b3 a5 10.a3
♗b7 11.♕e2 ♕c7  Black threatens …b5-b4 followed by…d6-d5;
D) 8.a3 White is not giving up the bishop for the knight. After 8…
♘c5N 9.♕e1 exf4 10.♗xf4 ♘e6 11.♗g3 (11.♗d2 d5=) the
bishop’s diagonal will be blocked by the strong e6-knight and Black –
once more – carries out his queenside pawn storm, which in the
meantime has become part of our own flesh and blood, by 11…b5
(11…d5 12.exd5 cxd5 13.♗b3 b6 14.♕d2 ♗b7 15.♖ae1  is also
playable) 12.♗a2 a5 13.♔h1 (13.e5 dxe5 14.♘xe5 ♘d4 ) 13…
♖a6!? . Black, with …d6-d5 or …b5-b4, can then become active.
Back to the game.

6.d3 0-0 7.0-0
The grandmaster from Poland permits the exchange of his bishop.
After 7.a3, 7…♗g4 provides good counterplay for Black:
A) 8.h3 Now White’s backward development becomes very great:
8…♗xf3 9.♕xf3 ♘d4 10.♕d1 (10.♕f2?! ♘h5! 11.h4 ♘f6 ) 10…c6
11.fxe5 (11.0-0 exf4 12.♗xf4 d5=) 11…♘d7! 12.0-0 ♘xe5 13.♗a2
♗g5=;
B) 8.0-0 8…exf4 9.♗xf4 ♘e5 prompts the trade of the other
bishop: 10.♗xe5 (10.♗b3?! ♘xf3+ 11.gxf3 ♗h3 12.♖f2 ♘h5
13.♗g3 c6 ) 10…dxe5 11.♔h1 c6 12.h3 ♗xf3 13.♕xf3. The attack
on f7 is harmless. After, for example, 13…g6 followed by …♔g7
Black has no problems.
7…♘a5 8.♗b3 ♘xb3 9.axb3 exf4 10.♗xf4 d5 11.e5 ♘e8=

The computer suggests a razor-thin advantage for White, but
possibly it underestimates Black’s long-term chances. He has no
weaknesses and should be able to make good his laggard
development. Every opening of the game will increase the value of
the bishop pair.
12.♕e1 c6 13.♕g3 ♗f5
13…♘c7!?
14.♗g5 ♘c7 15.♗xe7 ♕xe7 16.♘d4 ♗g6=

Black has a fully acceptable position. He can play on the queenside –
after …c6-c5 and …d5-d4 White would have a backward pawn on c2
– as well as on the kingside with …f7-f6, after which he will have
solved the problem of his hanging knight on c7. Gdanski,
accordingly, fights for the initiative on the kingside.
17.h4 ♘e6 18.♘ce2 ♘xd4 19.♘xd4 ♖ae8 20.♖ae1 ♕c5?!
The queen rashly moves away from the main battlefield.
The correct idea was 20…a6, retaining equal chances; e.g. 21.♕h3
h6 22.h5 ♗h7 23.♕g4 c5 24.♘f5 ♗xf5 25.♖xf5 d4=.
21.c3 a5 22.♔h2  ♕b6?! 23.e6!
Rozentalis presumably did not correctly calculate this tactical blow.
23…f6
The gigantic passed pawn is of course a thorn in the flesh of Black’s
position. But in this game the Lithuanian escaped with a bit of luck.
The pawn cannot be taken. 23…fxe6? would be refuted by
24.♖xf8+ ♖xf8 25.h5! ♗xh5 26.♘xe6 ♖f7 27.♕b8+!+–.
24.h5 ♗xh5 25.♘f5 ♗g6 26.e7! ♖f7 27.♘d6 ♖fxe7 28.♘xe8 ♖xe8

½-½
Conclusion
2…d6 is playable against the King’s Gambit. But it is important to
shake off White’s pressure on f7, for which we have learned two
plans: first, …♘c6-a5xc4(b3); and second, …c7-c6 followed by …
♘d7-c5, and now …♗e6, …♘e6 or …d6-d5. Of course, we never
know what will happen. In the event that you don’t like this way of
playing, or the white side finds improvements, you can always go
back to the system 1.e4 d6 2.f4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 d5.
Game 20
Arnold Hemmann 2217
Martin Auer 2331
Germany tt 2006

In the last game of this chapter we will examine some very rare
sidelines.
1.e4 d6
2.d4
A) After 2.d3 we can use the universal build-up with …e7-e5, …
♘bd7, …♗e7, …0-0 and …c7-c6; e.g. 2…e5 3.f4 ♘f6 4.♘f3 ♘bd7
5.g3 ♗e7 6.♗g2 0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.♕e2 ♕c7 9.♔h1 ♖e8=. Black’s
position is sound and harmonious, and he can proceed with …♘f8(-
g6) and over the longer term seek to play …d6-d5. As in the King’s
Gambit with 2…d6, among club players in similar positions we often
see 10.f5?!, after which 10…d5  (or 10…b5?! followed by …d6-d5)
gives Black the better chances;
B) 2.c4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 gives us the opportunity, after 4.d4 (4.f4
♗e7 5.♘f3 ♘c6 6.d3 0-0 7.♗e2 ♘d4 8.♘xd4 exd4 9.♘d5 ♘xd5
10.cxd5 c6=), to go into the Old Indian with 4…♘bd7, or with the
tempo gain by 4…exd4 5.♕xd4 ♘c6 6.♕d2 g6 to reach a favorable
version of the central structure with white pawns at e4 and c4
against black pawns on d6 and c7 – which, for players practiced in
fianchetto positions, constitutes a good alternative;
C) 2.c3 ♘f6 3.♘f3 e5 4.d3 ♗e7 is a harmless version of the
white formation from the variations 3.♗d3 and 3.♘d2. The most
important plan on White’s part lies in c2-c3 and d3-d4, when we

arrive at the formation seen previously in Game 18, Gedajlovic-
Arizmendi Martinez, with an extra move for Black;
D) 2.♗c4 ♘f6 3.♘c3 e5 leads after 4.♘f3 ♗e7 5.d4 exd4 to the
Antoshin Variation and after 4.f4 ♗e7 to the King’s Gambit.
Back to the game after 2.d4.
2…♘f6 3.♗c4
A last imaginative idea to get us out of our standard positions. This
shows that all opening studies have limits and a fundamental
understanding of the most important central game structures is
more valuable than the knowledge of many a concrete sequence. A
playable setup with …e7-e5 is not on the horizon. Instead, we have
no other option but to reveal the shadow side of the bishop move
and to strive for a pawn formation typical of the French, but in a
favorable configuration without the white king’s bishop!
After…
3…♘xe4!
White has nothing better than the liquidation…
4.♗xf7+ ♔xf7 5.♕h5+ ♔g8 6.♕d5+ e6 7.♕xe4
after which, with…
7…d5

a French structure arises that is promising for Black. After the white
queen moves away Black can get a superiority in the center with …
c7-c5. His king is safe enough at g8, as his opponent has given up
the light squares. Given the opportunity, Black will complete his
development with …h7-h6 (watch out for g2-g4-g5!) followed by …
♔g8-h7 or …♔g8-f7, …♖h8-f8 and …♔f7-g8.
8.♕d3?!
Either 8.♕e3 or 8.♕e2 is more precise.
8…c5  9.♘f3 ♘c6?!
≥ 9…cxd4
10.c3 cxd4 11.cxd4 ♗d6 12.0-0 h6 13.♘c3 ♕f6 14.a3 ♗d7 15.b4 ♖f8

The second player exerts pressure along the f-file and forces White’s
pieces to defend the pawn weakness at d4. He can build up his
position further on the kingside; e.g. with …g7-g5 and …♖h8-h7-f7,
but especially with …♗d7-e8-h5(g6), when the absence of the white
king bishop becomes palpable.
16.♗d2?!
≥ 16.♘e2! ♗e8 17.♘g3 ♗g6 18.♕c3 a6 19.♗b2 ♔h7
16…g5?!
16…♕f5 17.♕xf5 ♖xf5 18.♘e2 ♔h7 .
It’s not a good moment for …g7-g5, since after…
17.b5 ♘e7
Black must now loosen his control of e5.
18.♘e2 ♕g6 19.♕xg6+?!
Correct was 19.♕b3! ♖h7 20.a4, since the storm against the
unweakened white king position does not guarantee success; e.g.
20…♕h5 21.♘g3 ♖xf3 22.♕xf3 ♕xf3 23.gxf3 ♘g6 .
19…♘xg6
Now everything is again in harmony in the black formation; the
pressure on d4 gives him the advantage. In the game, Black was
able to increase his advantage:
20.♖fb1?! ≥ 20.a4 20…♖c8?! 20…g4! 21.♘e1 ♗xh2+ 22.♔xh2 ♖xf2 23.b6
axb6 24.♖xb6 ♗c6  21.♖a2 ♔f7 22.♗b4 ♗b8! 23.a4 g4?! 23…♖he8
24.♘e1 e5 25.♘d3? 25.dxe5 ♘xe5 25…♗f5  26.♖d1 ♗xd3 27.♖xd3 e4

27…♘f4 28.♖c3 28.♖d1 28…♖xc3 29.♘xc3 ♖c8 30.♘e2
♖c4 31.♗d2 h5 32.g3 h4 33.♔f1 h3 34.♔e1 ♘f8 35.♗e3

40.♖a4 ♔d6 41.a6 ♔c7? 41…b6 42.axb7? 42.♗f4+! ♔b6
43.♗e5  42…♔xb7  43.♖a6 ♘c7 44.♖g6 ♘xb5 45.♖xg4 a5

55.fxe3 ♘xe3+ 56.♔d2 ♖c2+ 57.♔d3 ♖xc1 58.♗d2 a2
0-1
Conclusion
If White relinquishes an early occupation of the center, Black can
nearly always opt for the universal setup with …e7-e5, …♗e7, …
♘bd7, …0-0 and …c7-c6. The variation 3.♗c4 does not allow this,
but the trade of the king bishop after 3…♘xe4 leads to a French
structure that is agreeable for Black.

1.d4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.c4 ♘bd7 4.♘c3 e5
But there are also some transpositions that lead to the diagram
position, for example when White opens with 1.♘f3 or 1.c4. Here
we deal with all the white formations in which White resorts to an
early c2-c4 and Black builds up according to the Old Indian patterns,
…e7-e5, …♘bd7 and …♘gf6, and therefore (notably) not with …f7-
f5 and …♘gf6.
The stem position of the Old Indian Defense.
For the first player there are a number of fundamentally different
formations at his disposal. We investigate, in order, five principal
white possibilities of developing his forces:
1) e2-e4 and ♗e2, the Classical System;
2) g2-g3 and ♗g2, the Fianchetto System;
These are the two main systems. Side variations are:
3) ♗g5 followed by e2-e3;
4) an early d4-d5 followed by e2-e4;
5) e2-e3
Black aims, after the further moves …♗e7, …0-0 and …c7-c6, at
counterplay through the typical expansion on the queenside with …

a7-a6 and …b7-b5. After that, inter alia, the opening of the center
with …e5xd4 followed by …b5-b4 and …c6-c5 is possible, a course of
play we know already from the Antoshin Variation. The opening of
the center with …e5xd4 also comes into consideration, without prior
queenside expansion, if Black is able to stabilize a knight on c5 with
…a7-a5 and exert pressure on the white pawns at c4, e4 and b2(3).
Lastly, the pawn formation after the closing of the center with d4-d5
is quite playable for Black if he compensates for his space
disadvantage with effective counterplay on the wings or by trading
off White’s dark-squared bishop with …♗e7-g5 or …♗e7-d8-b6.
Section 1: The Classical System: White plays e2-e4 and ♗e2
Especially in the main system with e2-e4 there is an immense variety
of possible move transpositions. Here, however, we shall orient
ourselves 
to 
the 
most 
important 
central 
formations, 
the
understanding of which is a good prerequisite for practical
application.
Game 21
Ketino Kachiani-Gersinska 2342
Erik Zude 2378
Germany Bundesliga 2014
1.♘f3 d6 2.d4 ♘f6 3.c4 ♘bd7 4.♘c3 e5 5.e4 ♗e7 6.♗e2 0-0 7.0-0 c6

8.♗e3
The first player selects a very principled system, one that loses no
time and plays actively against the black queenside. After …c7-c6
this could easily become weak – which the advance d4-d5 in
particular facilitates.
8…a6
Black strives for queenside expansion with …b7-b5 or – in somewhat
more restrained fashion – to develop the queen’s bishop with …b7-
b6 and …♗b7. After Black’s a-pawn moves forward the b6-square
will of course be weak and require protection; from now on it must
be covered by a knight at d7.
9.d5
From White’s point of view this is promising, stabilizing his queenside
space advantage, without loss of time, before Black gets counterplay
with …b7-b5-b4.
9.h3 is too slow for this purpose.
After 9…b5 White does not get in 10.d5 because of 10…b4!, when
Black’s expansion on the queenside has proven successful. After
11.♘a4 Black can close the queenside and assume a formation with
…♖e8, …♘d7-f8-g6 and …♗d7 (11.dxc6?! bxc3 12.cxd7 ♗xd7 ).
11…c5 12.♕c2 a5 13.b3 ♖e8 14.a3 ♘f8 15.♘b2 ♗d7= The a-file
doesn’t bring White any concrete advantage, and on the kingside the
chances are even.
Better is 10.a3 ♗b7 11.♕c2 with play typical of the variation with
8.♕c2, as we shall see in Game 13, So-Andreikin.

analysis diagram
In similar positions Black can develop pressure on the e4-pawn after
the exchange on d4. We shall see in the variation with g2-g3 that
this central formation is quite comfortable if Black can stabilize his
knight at c5 with …a7-a5 so that it cannot be driven away by the
white b-pawn. But even without a piece on c5 the transition to an
open center is playable for Black. The queenside expansion with …
c7-c6, …a7-a6 and …b7-b5 offers some possibilities for counterplay.
Here is a sample variation: 11…exd4 12.♘xd4 g6 (White’s knight
cannot now come to f5!) 13.♖fd1 ♖c8N Black prepares for a
possible opening of the c-file with the lever …c6-c5 or, after a prior
…b5xc4, …d6-d5. White must already play creatively if he is to
maintain the pressure: 14.♘f3! (after 14.b4?! Black’s possession of
the c-file pays off: 14…bxc4 15.♗xc4 c5! 16.bxc5 ♖xc5 17.♕a2
♕c8 18.♘d5 ♗xd5 19.♗xd5 ♘b6=) 14…♕c7 15.♗f4! ♖fe8
16.♖d2. White is about to assume an ideal setup against the
formation with the d6-pawn, which is so in need of protection. But
here too Black has effective counterplay available: 16…a5!? 17.b4
(17.cxb5 cxb5 18.♗xb5 ♘xe4 19.♖e2 ♗f8 ) 17…♕b6 18.♖b1
(18.♗xd6 axb4 19.axb4 c5! 20.bxc5 ♘xc5 ) 18…axb4 19.axb4 c5!
20.bxc5 (20.♗e3 ♗f8 21.bxc5 ♘xc5 22.♖xb5 ♕a7 ) 20…♘xc5
21.♖xb5 ♕a6

analysis diagram
This is a typical configuration: after the opening of the position as a
result of the collision of the two pawn fronts, the white e-pawn
remains vulnerable. With best play White retains some advantage,
but Black can hold, for example: 22.♕b2 ♘fxe4 23.♘xe4 ♗xe4
24.♗h6! ♗f8 25.♗xf8 ♖xf8 26.♖b6 ♕a5 27.♖bxd6 ♗a8 28.♖d1
♘e4 29.♖d7 ♘c3 30.♖c1 ♗xf3 31.♗xf3 ♖xc4 32.♖e1  However,
as soon as Black is able to consolidate his position, the game is
completely level.
Back to the main game.
9…cxd5
Black opens the c-file in order to initiate his counterplay on the
queenside.
10.cxd5

10…♘g4!
This move is important! It prevents White from reaching his ideal
position with a subsequent ♘d2, and, with gain of tempo, clears the
way for the lever …f7-f5.
10…b5 is comparatively less precise. After 11.♘d2 White has
assumed the perfect setup:
analysis diagram
The central pawn chain e4/d5 is secure and the bishop pair operates
on both wings. The spear-tip of Black’s queenside expansion, the b5-

pawn, will be the object of attack after a2-a4, when White, with his
piece preponderance, can lay siege to a weakness on the left-hand
side of the board. But we are now examining an example somewhat
more closely than usual, since here the difference between theory
(‘plus/equal’ in a game measured with computer accuracy) and
practice (people with their very different levels of knowledge and
their experiences of the rollercoaster of emotions during a
tournament game) is very apparent.
In my game with white against GM Vitaly Kunin, a consistent
advocate of the Old Indian Defense, I clearly remembered the
theoretical judgment and the right plan (a2-a4!). Nevertheless, I
came to the board with the incorrect idea of wanting to refute
Black’s counterplay, and procrastinated with the necessary action in
favor of a well-intentioned ‘prophylaxis’. Only a few moves later my
theoretical advantage was gone and we played a practical game with
about equal prospects in which, in the end, the stronger player was
able to push through – not the one who was better prepared in
terms of theory! This is a frequently encountered phenomenon in
the d6-repertoire: ‘plus/equal’ yields very little, and you have to play
the typical complicated positions well! 11…♘e8 (11…♘b6 2.a4! b4?!
13.a5!  is an important tactical detail that refutes Black’s play) 12.b4
♗g5 13.♗xg5 ♕xg5 14.♘b3? (14.a4!  was correct; Black has to
take care to defend his queenside. White wanted to retain the
advantages of his position. With the subsequent …f7-f5 Black, in
every case, gets active play on the kingside) 14…♘b6 In this typical
Old Indian position, with chances for both sides, the grandmaster
was able to push through: 15.♕c1 ♕d8 16.♕e3 f5 17.f3 ♘f6

Back to the main game.
11.♗d2 b5
12.b4!
White marks the b5-pawn as a weakness and on the next move
opens the queenside, where she has more space and more pieces
than her opponent.
A) 12.a4? b4! ;
B) 12.♘e1 forces the second player to block the f-pawn. Even so,
White’s queenside play also progresses somewhat slowly: 12…b4N
13.♗xg4 (13.♘a4 ♘gf6 14.f3 ) 13…bxc3 14.♗xc3 ♘c5 15.♗xc8

♕c4 21.♘b4 ♘xc3 22.bxc3 ♖c5
12…♘b6
Black threatens to stall the white queenside attack with 13…♗d7.
Our rule of thumb says: in the King’s Indian, the knight belongs on
c5; in the Old Indian, on b6. This is only a rough guideline, but it
often helps to orient us at the board. Here the choice was easy, but
not infrequently Black should direct the knight to b6 even if c5 is
available.
13.a4! bxa4 14.♘xa4 f5 15.exf5 ♗xf5

This is the basic theme of our main variation. Both sides have
consistently opened a file for attacking the opponent’s position.
White has clearly taken the lead – the a6-pawn is already hanging.
But Black has also found targets for attack: he can direct his pieces
against both the important d5-pawn and the b4-pawn – and also
against f2; tactical ingenuity is needed in this last case. In purely
theoretical terms, this is a critical variation in our repertoire. We will
therefore analyze this line in great detail.
With best play, White will retain the advantage. In practice, however,
Black should have very good chances, as the position is full of
tactical subtleties, many of which are directed against the white
kingside!
16.♘c3
16.♕b3 led to a game by Jörg Hickl after 16…♔h8 17.♘c3 ♕c8,
transposing into the main variation: 18.♖a5 e4 19.♘d4 ♗f6
20.♘xf5 (20.♘e6! ) 20…♕xf5  ½-½ (50) Mohr-Hickl, Germany
Bundesliga 1992/93.
But Black has better with 16…♘xa4N 17.♖xa4 ♕c8 18.♖a3
(18.♖c1 ♕e8 ) 18…♗d8 19.♖c1 ♕b7, leading to play on both
sides of the board; e.g. 20.h3 ♘f6 21.♖c6 ♗b6 .

16…♕c8
This passive move is inflexible; the a6-pawn cannot be held for long,
so Black should instead strive to develop purposeful activity as
quickly as he can.
As happens so often in tournament practice, in spite of my good
preparation I could no longer remember my concrete analysis and
began to improvise at the board. My opponent, who up to this point
had played very rapidly and confidently, seemed to be having a
similar experience.
Black can begin his counterplay here in various ways. In this long
theoretical variation (the longest in the entire book), you should by
no means try to learn by heart all the possible moves! You will be
much more successful if you analyze the different variations and
their tactical and positional themes – by doing this you will be able
to deepen your understanding of the position.
A) 16…h6!?N permanently prevents the maneuver ♘f3-g5-e6, by
which White, at the cost of a pawn, could get the bishop pair on an
open board. After 17.h3 ♘f6 18.♗xa6 ♘e4 19.♕e2 ♘xc3 20.♗xc3
♕e8 Black has given up the weak a6-pawn for the sake of a
kingside initiative, which after …♕g6 could develop into a real
attack. But unfortunately, White trades off the active posting at f5
and (after the exchange of bishops) gives away the d5-pawn, which

is hard to defend, for active piece play: 21.♗d3! (21.♖a5 ♕g6! )
21…♖c8 22.♗xf5 ♖xf5 23.♗d2 ♘xd5 24.♕e4 ♕f7 25.♖a7 ♖f6 ;
B) After 16…♕e8 the play is similar. The German master Klaus
Bischoff defended the black position successfully: 17.h3 ♘f6 18.♗e3
♗d8 19.♖xa6 (19.♘g5 ) 19…♖xa6 20.♗xa6 ♘e4 21.♘xe4 ♗xe4

Schwerin 1999 (25.♗xb6 ♗xa6 26.♕d5+! ♕f7 27.♖d1! );
B2) 23…♕g6N improves Black’s game: 24.♕g4 ♗xd5 25.♖d1
(25.♖c1 );
C) 16…♔h8 is our main variation, which Jörg Hickl has developed
over the years. Black makes a useful move for his king’s safety,
avoiding all the problems along the a2-g8 diagonal, in order
afterwards to prepare tactical strikes against f2 or d5. 17.♖a5! and
now:
C1) 17…♗f6!? leads to a wild tactical position, one that can
hardly be played faultlessly at the board, even by grandmasters!

♘c4 23.♖a1 ♘e3 24.♕e2 ♘xf1 25.♔xf1
C2) 17…♘f6N improves the variation for Black. With an imminent
…♕e8 the black queen makes room for the king’s bishop and brings
herself closer to the white kingside. With activity down the c-file and
maneuvers like …♗d8 and …♖b8 Black can establish counterplay,
so that White, even after the win of the a-pawn, cannot advance his
passed pawn on the b-file undisturbed; e.g. 18.♗xa6 (18.♕b3 ♕e8
19.♗xa6 ♖b8 20.♗e3 ♗d8 21.♗e2 ♘g4 22.♗d2 ♘a8! – an open

The pressure on the f-file and the vulnerable pawn on d5 give Black
compensation and good practical chances for the lost pawn.
Back to the main game.

17.♕b3 ♔h8
17…h6 is still very useful. After 18.h3 ♘f6 19.♖fc1 there follows
19…♗d8!, a move with three ideas:
1) avoiding the trick ♘xe5, …dxe5 d5-d6+;
2) supporting the b6-knight, directed against ♘c3-a4;
3) covering c7 against ♘c3-b5.

18.♘g5
Whereas both players have up to this point strengthened the game
largely in accordance with the requirements of the position,
supported by their concrete preparation, they now proceed – only a
few moves later! – to deviate more and more from it. The situation
has become very complicated. With the text move, Ketino Kachiani-
Gersinska prepares the advance f2-f4, a lever on the wrong side of
the board. With a systematic siege of a6 she would have retained
her advantage. In the further course of the game, both sides trade

inaccuracies, but without putting the position decisively out of
balance.

Conclusion
According to theory, the Classical System with 8.♗e3 a6 9.d5 puts
Black under pressure. White contests the black advance …b7-b5
quickly and very energetically with the lever a2-a4, after which Black
remains with an untenable weak pawn on a6. But Black, with …f7-
f5, can open the game on the kingside with …f7-f5 and gets
pressure down the f-file and against the d5- and e4-pawns, which
remain in need of protection.
Game 22
Jaime Santos Latasa 2511
Vitaly Kunin 2576
Porto 2015
1.c4 e5 2.♘c3 ♘f6
Against the English Opening the grandmaster Vitaly Kunin chooses
the main variation, which is not part of our repertoire. Our move

sequence against the English Opening, 2…d6 3.♘f3 ♗e7, is
discussed in Chapter 6.
3.♘f3 d6 4.d4
With 4.d3 or 4.g3, followed by a later d2-d3, White could now take
us out of our repertoire.
4…♘bd7
Leading by transposition into the Old Indian Defense.
5.e4 ♗e7 6.♗e2 0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.♖e1
White makes a flexible developing move and waits to see how Black
will deploy his forces. The rook consolidates White’s center, but does
not exert pressure the way it would on d1; cf. 8.♕c2 in the next
game (23), So-Andreikin.
8…♕c7
Black develops according to the typical pattern, but he could also
prepare …b7-b5 more purposefully.
8…a6 is our repertoire move. Now the game proceeds, after
A) 9.h3 b5;
B) 9.a3 b5 10.♕c2 ♗b7;
C) 9.♗f1 b5! 10.a3 (10.d5 b4 11.♘a4 c5=) 10…♕c7 with an
early queenside expansion similar to that in the game;
D) The rare 9.a4, on the other hand, is just about the only
possibility to keep black from playing …b7-b5. Just as in the system

with g2-g3 and ♗g2, we automatically answer a2-a4 with 9 …a5!,
after which almost every white advance on the queenside is rebutted
in the long run and – above all! – the squares c5 and b4 will pass
into our possession and be stable support points for black pieces.
The d4-pawn will move at some point or will be exchanged. After,
say, …exd4 and ♘xd4, the f5-square is denied to the white knight
by …g7-g6, entirely in the style of the Boleslavsky Wall, as we shall
see in the section on the system with g2-g3; e.g. 10.h3 ♖e8
11.♗e3 exd4 12.♘xd4 ♘c5 13.♕c2 ♗f8 14.f3 g6=, with agreeable
play for Black.
9.♗f1 a6 10.♖b1
White prepares to answer the impending …b7-b5 with b2-b4.
10…b5 11.b4
11.a3 ♖e8 12.h3 exd4! (12…♗b7!?; 12…♘f8 13.d5!) 13.♘xd4 g6∞
followed by …♗b7 and …♘e5.
The position after 11.b4:
White’s advance looks impressive and at first glance makes sense.
The b4-pawn blocks …b5-b4 and at the same time takes the c5-
square from Black’s knight. The pawn pushes to the fourth rank are
well supported by the rooks and Black has to keep in mind all further
transformations of the central structure. Further gains of space with

d4-d5 or c4-c5, as well as exchange operations with c4xb5, are
possible. Yet the text move at the same time gives Black two
potential levers, …c6-c5 and …a6-a5, with which he can open files
and diagonals. Black should quickly attack the unstable white pawn
front before the first player can consolidate his space advantage.
11…bxc4
Kunin undertakes active operations at once, but he could have
waited.
A) 11…♘b6?! would permit White, with 12.dxe5! (12.c5 ♘bd7
13.dxe5?! ♘xe5! 14.♘xe5 dxe5 ) to go over to a symmetrical
central structure, as we saw in the game Andersson-Malaniuk. And
unfortunately, Black would lose two tempi through the maneuver …
♘d7-b6-d7: 12…dxe5 13.c5 ♘bd7 14.♕c2 ;
B) 11…♖e8!? leads by transposition to the game Rotstein-Hickl.
By contrast, Black is not yet prepared to surrender the center with
11…exd4. After 12.♘xd4 g6 13.cxb5 axb5 14.a4!  White attacks the
black queenside before Black can work up pressure on the e4-pawn.
12.♗xc4 ♘b6
In this way Black develops his queen’s bishop with gain of tempo. To
be sure, he has to accept a marked weakness on a6 and must now
compensate for this with active play.
12…exd4 would not quite lead to equality: 13.♘xd4 ♘e5 14.♗f1
c5!? 15.bxc5 dxc5 16.♘f5 ♗xf5 17.exf5
But 12…♖b8!? and 12…a5!? also came into consideration.
13.♗e2 ♗g4

14.h3
A good human move, by which the bishop is forced to decide
between the right- and left-hand sides of the board.
The computer move 14.♗e3!  consolidates White’s position. The
point is that White, after 14…♗xf3 15.gxf3!, can get away with
allowing the doubled pawn, as Black can hardly take advantage of
this weakness (15.♗xf3 ♘c4 16.♗c1 exd4 17.♕xd4 ♘e5 18.♗e2
c5 19.bxc5 dxc5 20.♕d2 c4 ).
14…♗h5 15.dxe5
This exchange underscores the vulnerability of the c6-pawn on the
half-open c-file. But Black’s bishop also becomes active.
Here too 15.♗e3 ♖fb8 16.a3 would have consolidated White’s
advantage.
15…dxe5 16.♗e3

If White now had time to permanently fix the a6- and c6-pawns,
Black would stand poorly. Hence Kunin liquidates one of the
weaknesses at once, at the same time creating threats against the
b4-pawn.
16…♗xf3! 17.♗xf3 ♘c4! 18.♗c1 a5!
18…c5 is not as good, since after 19.bxc5  the d5-square would
pass to White.
19.a3?!
After this the b-pawn remains in need of protection. Santos Latasa
perhaps still hoped for an easy white advantage and therefore
avoided simplification.
19.♕e2 is somewhat stronger, though after 19…axb4 20.♕xc4 bxc3
21.♗e3 ♘d7 Black can compensate for the weakness of his c-pawn
with pressure against the white a-pawn.
19…♖fb8!
Black has now left all his problems behind him and even takes over
the initiative. In the phase of the game between moves 30 and 40,
presumably in time pressure, Kunin increases this initiative, without,
however, attaining more than a draw.
20.♘a2 axb4 21.♘xb4 c5!? 21…♘xa3 22.♗xa3 ♖xa3 23.♘xc6! ♖xb1

½-½
Conclusion
Against the formation with ♖e1, ♖b1 and b2-b4, Black can at the
right moment release the central tension and build up pressure on
the advanced white pawns. The move b2-b4 cramps Black’s game,
but it also gives him an additional lever in …a6-a5 for obtaining
counterplay.
Game 23
Wesley So 2674
Dmitry Andreikin 2650
Biel 2010
Dmitry Andreikin is one of the few top players who regularly reaches
for the Old Indian Defense. This game was played in the last round
of the traditional grandmaster tournament in Biel. With a victory, the
Russian would be able to catch the leading trio: Nguyen, Vachier-
Lagrave and Caruana.
1.♘f3 ♘f6
Andreikin here chooses a line that could lead to our repertoire.
1…d6 2.c4 e5 3.♘c3 ♗e7 4.d4 ♘d7 5.e4 ♘gf6 is our line.
2.c4 d6 3.♘c3 e5 4.d4
Be careful what you play! After 4.d3 another variation against the
English Opening would be reached, which we will aim for later (see
Chapter 6).
4…♘bd7 5.e4 ♗e7 6.♗e2 0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.♕c2

With 8.♕c2 White develops very harmoniously and prepares ♖fd1.
He can put off a decision regarding the center until later. In this
game the center gets closed with d4-d5.
8…a6 9.♖d1
Threatening 10.dxe5.
9…♕c7 10.♗e3
White need not prepare this with h2-h3: on …♘g4 he can follow up
with (among other moves) ♗d2.
10.♗g5 is very popular here; see the next game, Atalik-Hickl.
10…♖e8
After the center opens Black will exert pressure on the e4-pawn.
A) On 10…b5 White is the better placed: 11.cxb5 cxb5 12.♖ac1
♕b8 13.a4 b4 14.dxe5 ♘xe5 15.♘xe5 dxe5 16.♘d5 ♘xd5 17.exd5
;
B) 10…♘g4 does not help our cause: 11.♗d2 ♕b6N (11…♘gf6
12.b4 ) 12.♗e1!  (12.c5 dxc5 13.d5! ♘gf6 );
C) 10…b6 is a rare alternative; with …♗b7 Black’s development
on the queenside is complete.
11.♖ac1
The Filipino star, who since this game has moved to the USA and
reached the highest level, prepares for the opening of the c-file.
A) 11.d5 cxd5 12.cxd5 b5 13.a3 ♘f8 14.♖dc1 ♘g6 15.h3 ♗d7=.
In this position everything is fine for Black. He is ready to contest

the c-file and can quickly bring his king’s bishop to b6 via d8;
B) 11.h3 This harmless-looking, flexible move poses the question
to Black of whether he is really ready for …b7-b5. If not, how else
does he plan to complete his development?
analysis diagram
B1) The immediate 11…b5 is risky. White can open the c-file and
exploit his lead in development on the queenside:
B11) 12.a3 is not energetic enough. In a game with the top
German player Christopher Lutz, Jörg Hickl was able to get the
upper hand surprisingly quickly. Christopher was much more familiar
with 1.e4 openings, but let himself be inveigled into testing Jörg in
the Old Indian. The game is a further example of the fact that
White’s theoretical advantage in a practical game is not as easy to
prove as would seem at first glance: 12…♗b7 13.♖ac1 ♖ac8
14.dxe5 dxe5 15.♕b1 b4 16.axb4 ♗xb4 17.♘d2?! a5 18.♘b3 ♗xc3
19.bxc3?! c5 . White’s pieces are poorly placed and the hole at d5 is
difficult to reach, 0-1 (48) Lutz-Hickl, Bad Neuenahr 1991;
B12) 12.cxb5 cxb5 13.♖ac1 ♗b7 14.dxe5!N and now after 14…
dxe5 (14…♘xe5 15.♕b1 ♕b8 16.b4 ) 15.♘g5! White’s lead in
development could grow to a dangerous attack. 15…h6?! is already
wrong because of 16.♘xf7! ♔xf7 17.♕b3+ ♔g6 18.♘xb5 , but

even after the better 15…♕d8 16.♕b3! ♖f8 17.a4 h6 18.♘f3 White
clearly stands better.
B2) Giving up the center in this position leads to a quite passive
version of the Boleslavsky Wall (see Section 2, The Fianchetto
System): 11…exd4 12.♘xd4 g6 13.b4 ♗f8 14.♖ab1 b6!? ;
B3) We recommend the more careful 11…b6. After development
with …♗c8-b7 Black threatens …exd4 and …c6-c5. 12.♖ac1 ♗b7:
B31) After 13.d5, now it makes sense to close the queenside with
13…c5 (13…♖ec8 14.♘d2! ) and to prepare a kingside counter-
attack, where White’s h2-h3 has weakened him slightly. Here is a
sample variation: 14.♖b1 ♘f8 15.b4 ♘6d7 16.♘h2 h6 17.a3 ♗c8 ,
with complications on both sides of the board;
B32) After 13.♕b1 exd4! the typical central counterplay goes
smoothly. Among other choices, Black can strive for a Benoni
structure in which the queen’s bishop should be exchanged:
14.♘xd4 g6 (in the open central structure we do not permit the
white knight to come to f5!) 15.b4 c5 16.♘d5 ♗xd5 17.cxd5 ♗f8
We have reached a Benoni structure in which Black has correctly
traded off his queen’s bishop and now, despite a shortage of space,
is able to find a good square for every one of his pieces. White’s
knight on c6 is somewhat disruptive, but it does not attack any
important squares;
B33) With 13.b4 White prevents the appearance of an active
knight at c5: 13…exd4N (13…g6?! 14.d5!) 14.♘xd4 c5!? (14…g6!?)
15.bxc5 ♘xc5 16.f3 g6 White stands somewhat better, but the
second player has good chances for active play on the dark squares.
Back to the game.

11…♘g4
White should be provoked into the (slight) weakening of his kingside
with h2-h3.
The immediate 11…♕b8 will probably transpose to the game:
A) Black is now well set up for 12.d5: 12…cxd5 13.cxd5 b5 14.a3
♗d8 (14…♘b6?! 15.♘a2  with the idea ♘b4-c6) 15.h3 h6= and
Black can consolidate his queenside before White rolls him up with
b2-b4 and a2-a4. In particular, the exchange of the dark-squared
bishops will work out very positively for Black over the long term;
B) But if White strengthens his position with the waiting move
12.h3 (13.a3 leads to the game position after the 15th move), the
second player will finally be ready for 12…b5!.

analysis diagram
The threat …b5-b4, after which the c5-square beckons, tempts the
first player to react with 13.b4, after which Black, as we saw in the
previous game, has both the levers …a6-a5 and …c6-c5 available.
This should provide him with sufficient counterplay. Then the game
becomes very tactical; here is a sample variation: 13…a5 14.dxe5
(14.♖b1 axb4 15.♖xb4 d5! ) 14…dxe5 15.cxb5 axb4 16.bxc6 bxc3
17.cxd7 ♗xd7 18.♕xc3 ♗a4 19.♖b1! ♕c8 20.♕xc8 ♖exc8
21.♖dc1! ♘xe4 22.♖xc8+ ♖xc8 23.♘xe5 ♘c3 24.♗g4! ♘xb1
25.♗xc8 ♘c3 26.♗a6 ♗d6 27.♗d4 ♗xe5 28.♗xe5 ♘xa2 29.♗c4
♘b4 30.♗d6 ♘c6 31.f3 ♘d8  and Black holds.
12.♗d2 ♘gf6 13.h3

Wesley So is clearly not ready to split the point, but he also cannot
know whether Andreikin is in fact aiming for a three-fold repetition.
The little pawn move enables White to play ♗e3 undisturbed, but it
also weakens his king position somewhat.
13…♕b8
Black is determined to play …b7-b5. As we already know, this is
risky. White is optimally placed for play down the c-file and for an
attack on the b5-pawn with the lever a2-a4. But Black has
alternatives at his disposal:
A) 13…exd4 14.♘xd4 g6 15.b4 ♗f8  is a less attractive form of
the Boleslavsky Wall. Since Black’s knight does not come to c5, Black
lacks a place for it – and counterplay;
B) Worth recommending is 13…a5N. Black exploits the disturbed
harmony in the white camp and guarantees himself at least two
moves to use the c5-square to further his counterplay:
B1) If White prepares b2-b4 with 14.a3, he is bothered by the
surprising 14…a4! (14…exd4 15.♘xd4 g6 16.b4 ♗f8), after which
the exchange of the edge-pawn for the center pawn promises no
advantage for White. After 15.♗e3 exd4 16.♗xd4 (16.♘xd4 ♘c5=)
16…♕a5  we get a good version of the Boleslavsky Wall – Black has
permanent control of c5;
B2) 14.b3 prepares a2-a3 followed by b3-b4, but this is somewhat
slow. After 14…exd4 15.♘xd4 g6 16.a3 ♗f8 17.♗f4 ♘c5 (17…♕b6

18.♖b1) White is forced into the awkward bishop move 18.♗f3.
After the push b3-b4, Black succeeds in keeping the position
approximately level with skillful maneuvering against the vulnerable
pawns at e4 and c4; e.g. 18…♕e7 19.b4 axb4 20.axb4 ♘cd7 21.b5
c5 22.♘b3 ♕e6 23.♘d2 (23.♘d5 ♘xd5 24.♖xd5 b6=) 23…♘b6
24.♗e2 ♗d7 ;
B3) 14.d5 here is not as strong as in the game, since White lacks
the important lever against the b5-pawn, so the queenside cannot
be opened quickly: 14…♘c5 15.♗e3 b6 16.dxc6 ♕xc6 17.♘h2 ♗e6
18.b3 ♕c8 19.♘f1 ♕b7 20.♘g3 g6
14.♗e3 b5 15.a3 ♗b7
In principle, the black queen’s bishop, after the closing of the center
with d4-d5 and cxb5, …cxb5, belongs on d7. But this is not so easy
to bring about.
After 15…♕b7? 16.cxb5 axb5 17.d5! the vulnerability of the
extended black pawn front is clear. To avoid the loss of a pawn the
game gets opened up, and Black’s backwardness in development
becomes evident: 17…cxd5 18.exd5 b4 19.♘b5! ♖f8 20.♘c7 bxa3
21.♘xa8 axb2 22.♖b1 ♕xa8 23.♖xb2 ♘xd5 24.♖a2 ♘xe3 25.fxe3
♕b7 26.♗a6+–
16.b4
16…♗f8

Now Black stands ready to open the center with …exd4, followed by
pressure on the e4-pawn. For White this is the right moment to close
the center, since after the text it will take a long time to transfer the
bad bishop from f8 to b6.
17.d5! ♖c8 18.♘d2 ♗e7 19.dxc6
Wesley So brings about a standard position that promises White an
advantage.
Still more purposeful was 19.♘b3! bxc4 20.♘a5!, when the position
is opened and White dominates. Here is a sample variation: 20…
cxd5 21.exd5 ♗d8 22.♘xc4  (22.♘c6 ♕c7 23.♗xc4 ♘b6 24.♗b3
♗xc6 25.dxc6 ♕xc6 26.♕d3 ♕e8 27.♘e4!  ♘xe4 28.♕xe4 ♖xc1
29.♖xc1 d5 30.♗xd5 ♘xd5 31.♕xd5 )
19…♗xc6 20.♕d3
Here too 20.♘b3! would have put Black in great difficulty: 20…♗d8
21.♕d2 ♗c7 22.f3!
Now the pressure has abated and Black can gradually equalize. The
rest of the game elucidates quite beautifully the play in this typical
pawn formation. After the danger of the pawn lever a3-a4 is averted
and Black can exchange his king’s bishop, he even gets the upper
hand, but the game cannot be won by itself.
20…♘b6! 21.♘d5

21.cxb5 axb5 22.♘xb5 d5 23.♖xc6! ♖xc6 24.exd5 ♘bxd5 25.♗f3

Conclusion

The formation with 8.♕c2, ♗e3 and h2-h3 is very flexible. Black
must play accurately and at the right moment bring about the pawn
structure that is best for him. Giving up the center with …exd4 will
only be comfortable if the knight is stable at c5, but this will be
feasible only if Black can generate pressure on the white pawns on
e4, c4 and, if appropriate, b2(3). In the closed structure after d4-d5
Black should seek to exchange his king’s bishop with …♗e7-d8-
b6x♗e3.

8.♕c2 a6 9.♖d1 ♕c7
In addition to the natural moves 10.♗e3, 10.h3 and others, there is
the surprising…
10.♗g5
By far the most popular move! But it is not altogether clear what the
bishop wants to do on the kingside.
10…♖e8
The immediate 10…h6 is also good.

11.♖ac1 h6
12.♗h4
Astonishingly enough, after …h7-h6 the bishop is almost always
played to h4. Then its exchange, whether for the black king’s bishop
or for a knight, is really not in White’s interest.
12.♗e3!?, though quite rare, would have the poisonous side-effect
that after the weakening …h7-h6, giving up the center with …exd4
can hardly be considered. After ♘xd4, …g7-g6, which is practically
forced, would be too compromising to Black’s kingside. But the
formation with …♘f8-g6 is available to Black. Here are a few sample
variations: 12…♘f8 13.h3 ♘g6 (13…♗d7 14.c5!) 14.dxe5 dxe5
15.♘a4 ♗e6:
A) 16.♗b6 ♕c8 17.♗a5 ♗xh3! (17…♘d7 18.c5 ) 18.♘b6
(18.gxh3 ♕xh3 19.♘h2 b5! 20.♘b6?! ♗c5!–+) 18…♕g4 19.♘e1

♕h4=;
B) 16.♘b6 16…♖ad8 17.c5 ♖xd1+ (17…♘d7 18.♘d5!)
18.♖xd1 ♘d7 19.♘xd7 ♗xd7 20.♗c4 ♘f8 21.♕c3 ♗f6 22.♗b3
♗e6 23.♘d2 ♖d8 24.♘c4 ♗xc4 25.♕xc4 ♖xd1+ 26.♗xd1 ♘h7!
27.♗g4 ♗g5=
12…♘h7?!

The positionally correct exchange of the dark squared bishops
overlooks an instructive tactical finesse that is founded on Black’s
much-delayed development.
Correct was 12…♘f8 13.c5 (13.♗g3 ♘h5! or 13.d5 c5!, in each
case followed by the exchange of the white queen’s bishop for a
knight) 13…dxc5 14.dxe5 ♘6d7 15.♗g3 ♕a5∞ with the idea …b7-
b5 (15…♘e6 16.♘d5! cxd5 17.exd5 ♘df8 18.d6 ).
13.♗xe7 ♖xe7
14.♕d2
White looks to penetrate to d6, but misses the tactical solution.
14.c5! You should take note of this important ‘cross lever’! 14…dxc5
15.dxc5 White’s gain of space, with the seizing of d6, and the open
lines for his pieces (♘d2-c4-d6 and ♗e2-c4), promise White the
advantage, since Black can hardly occupy the d4-square: 15…♖e8
(15…♘xc5?! 16.♘d5!  is the tactical wrinkle that apparently
escaped both grandmasters; White opens the position and gets the
piece back, with a great advantage; e.g. 16…cxd5 17.exd5 ♖e8
18.d6 ♕b6 19.♕xc5 ♕xc5 20.♖xc5 ) 16.♘a4
14…♘hf6

15.♘h4?!
Atalik misses the final opportunity to open the position to his
advantage. But this time matters were very complicated.
15.c5! dxc5 16.dxe5 ♘xe5 17.♕d8+ ♘e8 18.♘a4
15…♘f8
Now Black’s positional concept comes undone. The exchange of the
bishop is promising, since the e4- and c4-pawns are fixed on the
same color as the white bishop. But Black’s backwardness in
development must first be addressed.
16.d5
The closing of the center brings no advantage in view of the
distribution of pieces on both sides, but other moves would not have
been any better. In a closed position, however, the risk increases
that the bad bishop will not be compensated for by the activity of
the other pieces.
16…c5

White has the levers f2-f4 and b2-b4 available, while Black has …f7-
f5 and …b7-b5. White still has a lead in development, but in view of
the impending endgame with a bad bishop he must exercise great
care. The opening has been a clear success for the second player.
What ensues is a model positional game, not without tactical
inaccuracies, that illustrates the potential of the better minor piece in
a closed structure. A detailed discussion of this game can be found
in our book The Power of Pawns.

Conclusion

Black can answer the development of the white queen’s bishop to g5
(and, as a consequence of …h7-h6, to h4) by exchanging it for his
king’s bishop or the knight. In the process he must watch out for the
‘cross-lever’ c4-c5!.

Jörg Hickl 2537
Germany Bundesliga 2005/2006
1.d4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.c4 ♘bd7 4.♘c3 c6
Jörg Hickl chooses a line that takes the vitality out of the system
5.♗g5 (see Section 3 in this chapter). But there is no particular
reason to circumvent the variation 4…e5 5.♗g5.
5.e4 e5 6.♗e2 ♗e7 7.0-0 0-0 8.♖b1
8…♖e8
Both sides can choose various lines. The rook move is useful both for
the build-up with …♘d7-f8-g6 as well as for the surrender of the
center with …exd4.
For 8…a6 see Game 26, Andersson-Malaniuk.
9.♖e1 a6 10.b4 ♕c7
10…b5 is also playable, but why give the opponent a lever? 11.a4 .
11.♗f1

A remarkable picture. The four (!) white pawns on the fourth rank
are well supported but at the moment are not yet accomplishing
anything. The first player is not yet ready to try to win more space
with d4-d5 or c4-c5. Exchange operations on e5 or b5 only make
Black’s development easier.
11.h3N and 11.♗e3 do nothing about …exd4, which is hanging in
the air.
11…b5 12.a4
White applies a lever with a fifth pawn, but Black is well placed for
the opening of the position.
After 12.d5?! bxc4 13.dxc6 ♕xc6 White hardly has compensation.
12…exd4 13.♘xd4
13…♘e5?!
The opening of the c-file made possible by this move is more
unpleasant than at first appears.
More precise was 13…bxc4!? 14.♗xc4 ♘e5 15.♗a2 c5!  16.♘f5
(16.bxc5 dxc5 17.♘d5 ♘xd5 18.♗xd5 ♖b8 19.♖xb8 ♕xb8=) 16…
♗xf5 17.exf5 cxb4 18.♘d5 ♘xd5 19.♕xd5 ♗f6=.
14.axb5
This leads, after the forced reply, to the closing of the position with a
white pawn preponderance in the center of the board, together with
a space advantage. It will emerge, however, that these static

advantages are compensated for by the harmonious and active
deployment of the black pieces.
With 14.cxb5! cxb5 15.♗d2!  Rotstein could have revealed the
weaknesses in Black’s formation: the d5-square and a vulnerable
pawn on the queenside.
14…cxb5 15.♘d5 ♘xd5 16.cxd5
This structure reminds us of the Benoni formation and could arise
from it through the exchange …c5xb4, a3xb4.
16…♗d7 17.f3
We have already seen in the analysis of the main variation of 8.♗e3
in Game 21 what dramatic consequences this little pawn move can
have. Naturally it is pleasant to have a firm and apparently
unassailable center. But here too the weakening of the king position
will have surprising consequences.
17.♘b3 f5 ; better were 17.♗b2 ♗g5∞ or 17.♗f4 ♖ac8∞.
17…♖ac8
17…♘c4!? deserves attention, even if it is very difficult to give up
the fine central knight for the bad bishop.
18.♗e3 ♕b7 19.♘b3?!
19.♗f2 was better. If White can hold the center, he gets the
advantage.

Rotstein permits the …f7-f5 lever, after which all (!) Black’s pieces
become active.
19…f5! 20.♘a5 ♕a8 21.exf5?!
Now Black’s initiative surges. 21.♘c6, to simplify, was absolutely
necessary.
21…♗xf5  22.♖c1 ♗h4!
White did not of course foresee when playing 17.f3 that his kingside
would come under bombardment.
23.g3?
A tactical oversight in a difficult position. With 23.♖xc8 ♖xc8 24.g3
the damage could have been limited: 24…♗f6 25.♘c6 ♘xc6
26.dxc6 ♕xc6 .
23…♖xc1! 24.♗xc1

Conclusion
After the opening of the center with …exd4 and the queenside
expansion with …c7-c6, …a7-a6, and …b7-b5 various center
formations can arise. A strong white pawn on d5 secures White a
lasting space advantage, which Black must compensate for with
active counterplay.

8…a6 9.♕c2 ♕c7

The Swedish GM Ulf Andersson, admired even by the strongest
players in the world for his fine positional play, has a predilection for
positions with a symmetrical pawn distribution, in which he can
outmaneuver opponents with his phenomenal feeling for harmony
and the interaction of the pieces.
This can clearly be achieved with…
10.dxe5 dxe5
If Black could now bring the c5-square under his permanent control,
e.g. with …a7-a5, without White being able to play b2-b4 and c4-c5,
he would even have the better structure. But after…
11.b4
c4-c5 cannot be prevented. With…
11…b5
Black gains space on the queenside, controls the c4-square – a fact
that is of relevance to the maneuver ♘f3-d2-c4 and to the white
king’s bishop – and fixes the b4-pawn. In addition, the fixing of the
black queenside pawn structure after c4-c5 is avoided.
12.c5
White now has a permanent space advantage, and it is not
altogether easy for Black to achieve a harmonious development of
his pieces. Still he does have the lever…
12…a5
after which he decides whether and when the a-file will be opened.
13.a3

The position seems quite harmless – and, strictly speaking, this is
the case. But Black has to come up with a good plan for activating
his pieces.
13…♖e8?!
In the game continuation Black does not find a good scheme of
development and shortly thereafter has to passively protect the
important e5-pawn, without being able to activate his queen’s
bishop.
With 13…♘h5!?N Black can deploy his forces harmoniously. He is
aiming for the formation …g7-g6 and …f7-f6, after which the
important e5-pawn is reliably protected and all his minor pieces find
good squares. White then has no breakthrough squares – f5 and d6
are protected: 14.g3 (14.♖e1 ♘df6 15.g3 ♗e6 16.♘g5 ♗d7
17.♘d1 g6 18.♘e3 ♘g7 19.♗b2 ♘fh5 20.♘f3 f6=) 14…g6
15.♗b2 ♘g7 16.♘d1 f6 17.♘e3 ♘b8!?= with the idea …♘a6.
14.♗b2
Andersson has the e5-pawn in his sights.
14…♗f8
14…♘f8 15.♘d1 ♘g6 16.♘e3 ♗e6 17.♘f5  was somewhat better,
but also not completely unproblematic for Black.
15.♗d1
This bishop maneuver, perhaps a bit too subtle, gives Black the
opportunity to go back to the formation with …♘h5.

Very forceful was 15.♘d1!?, e.g. 15…♘h5 16.g3 g6 17.♘e3 ♘df6
18.a4 .
15…♘b8?!
Malaniuk overlooked or perhaps underestimated the following plan,
after which he comes under great pressure.
Black had better alternatives in 15…♘h5!? or 15…g6!?.
16.♘e2!
The knight clears the c3-square so that White’s bishop and queen
can aim at the sore e5-square. This is very finely played, and typical
of Ulf Andersson: the harmonious cooperation of the opposing
pieces is inhibited. The rest of the game is a nice demonstration of
good technique. The former World #4 takes the whole board under
his control and patiently increases his advantage without allowing
even a whiff of counterplay.

Conclusion
In the symmetrical position after dxe5 and …dxe5, Black can count
on equality even after White’s promising c4-c5. This type of position
is very rich in content and offers both sides the opportunity for
creative maneuvering.
Section 2: The Fianchetto System
Against the fianchetto of the white king’s bishop and the subsequent
occupation of the center with e2-e4, Black’s typical counterplay with
…c7-c6, …a7-a6 and …b7-b5 is very effective. White’s king’s bishop
is missing from the diagonal e2-a6. This applies both to the center
that is closed by d4-d5 as well as to an open center after …e5xd4. If
white prevents the advance …b7-b5 with a2-a4, the weak b4-square
is fixed with an immediate …a6-a5.

8.e4

Against the Fianchetto Variation we construct our game just as we
do against the Classical System with e2-e4 and ♗e2, that is, with …
c7-c6, …a7-a6 and …b7-b5. Black’s queenside expansion is less risky
than in the Classical, since the pressure exerted on b5 and a6 by
White’s king’s bishop is missing in this line. Plus, we benefit from the
extra tempo expended in the bishop fianchetto. We are of course
careful with the …b7-b5 advance as long as White has not yet closed
the diagonal with e2-e4! For a closer look, see Game 29, Micottis-
Zude.
8…a6 9.d5
In this game we deal with the closing of the center by d4-d5; in the
next game we see the move 9.h3, without which it is not easy for
White to react to Black’s expansion on the queenside, as we see in
the following variations:
A) 9.♕c2 b5 (9…b6!?) 10.♖d1 ♕c7 11.cxb5! (11.c5 dxc5
12.♘xe5 ♘xe5 13.dxe5 ♕xe5 14.h3 ♘d7∞) 11…cxb5 12.♕e2 ♗b7
13.dxe5 dxe5 14.♗e3 ♖ac8 15.a4 (15.♘d5 ♘xd5 16.exd5 ♖fd8=)
The lever a2-a4 caused problems for Black in the Classical System
with e2-e4 and ♗e2. In the Fianchetto System, however, the
pressure from e2 is missing, so Black can equalize: 15…bxa4
16.♖xa4 a5=, when the weak black a-pawn can be supported with
…♗b4 if necessary;

B) 9.♖e1 b5 (9…♖e8) 10.c5 (10.cxb5 axb5  11.d5? b4! 12.dxc6
bxc3 13.cxd7 cxb2 14.♗xb2 ♗xd7 ) The rapid opening of the
center is logical; after all, the second player has deferred the
development of the queenside in favor of the (weakening) expansion
with …b7-b5. If White, after the exchange of his d- and c-pawns for
Black’s e- and d-pawns, were to get in ♘d4 and f2-f4, Black’s
position would be on the verge of collapse! Nevertheless, the
availability of the g4-square helps Black in his search for effective
counterplay. 10…♕c7 11.cxd6 ♗xd6:
B1) 12.dxe5 ♘xe5 13.♘xe5 (13.♘d4? ♗c5 ) 13…♗xe5  14.f4?
♘g4! ;
B2) 12.♗g5 ♘g4!  13.h3 (13.dxe5? ♗c5 ) 13…h6 14.♗c1 exd4
15.♘xd4 ♘xf2 16.♔xf2 ♗xg3+ 17.♔g1 ♗xe1 18.♕xe1 ♖e8∞
C) After 9.a4 – as almost always in the Old Indian – we
automatically play 9…a5, which secures the c5-square for Black and
stabilizes the whole queenside. More on this in Game 30, Laustsen-
Zude.
9…cxd5 10.cxd5
Compared with the closing of the center in the Classical Variation
(e2-e4 and ♗e2), Black, in this position, is under less pressure.
Inasmuch as White has expended an extra tempo developing his

king’s bishop, Black gets a comfortable game with …b7-b5 and …
♘b6.
10…b5 11.♖e1
11.a3 ♘b6 (in this structure it is fundamental that this bishop goes
to d7. Exceptions to this, based on the idea …f7-f5, exf5 followed by
…♘xd5, only prove the rule) 12.♘e1 ♗d7 Black is better placed for
the struggle on the queenside. He can play down the c-file (the
outpost at c4) as well as expand further with …a6-a5 and …b5-b4
followed by …♗d7-b5.
11…♘b6 12.b3 ♕c7 13.♗d2 ♗d7 14.♖c1 ♕b7 15.♗f1 ♖fc8
Black’s development is complete. It is true that he has less space at
his disposal and must manage a (potential) marked weakness at d6.
On the other hand, all his pieces have easily found good squares, in
particular the king’s bishop, which can go to b6 or perhaps a5 by
way of d8. The chances are about even. In the ensuing play, Dr
Robert Hübner, at his best rated number three in the world,
succeeds in confronting Jörg Hickl with a few additional problems,
but with a tenacious defense Hickl is able to reach a draw. A closer
study of the further course of the game is highly recommended –
some transformations typical of this pawn structure occur as the play
proceeds.

Conclusion
The immediate closure of the center with d4-d5 leads to positions
similar to those in the Classical Variation with e2-e4 and ♗e2. But
Black is under less pressure here and gets a good game with …b7-
b5 and …♘b6.

The most natural move. So long as Black does not open the center,
White would like to place his queen’s bishop on e3 without having to
fear the sortie …♘g4.

In this game the center gets opened with …exd4, after which Black
can comfortably spread out on the queenside with …b7-b5. For 9.a4
a5! see Game 30, Laustsen-Zude.
9…b5
The immediate thrust is playable, but it permits White, with the
familiar ‘cross-lever’, to reach a quite comfortable position.
A) This would also be the case after 9…♖e8 10.♕c2 b5 11.c5!;
B) 9…♕c7 is our repertoire move. It avoids c4-c5, as …d6xc5
could then follow:
B1) 10.♕c2 b5 11.♗e3 (11.♖d1 ♗b7 12.♗e3) 11…♗b7 12.cxb5

B3) 10.a4 a5!;
B4) 10.♗e3 b5 11.a3 ♖e8 with play similar to the game. The fact
that Black can no longer assume the formation with …♕d8 without
loss of tempo is unimportant: 12.cxb5 axb5 13.♕c2 ♕b7!=
10.a3
The Romanian grandmaster forgoes c4-c5, after which the game
goes into the structure we’re looking for.
10.c5!? is a move we would like to avoid, even if Black can
successfully defend himself:

analysis diagram
This position is very unpleasant for Black, as he can scarcely find
leverage points for effective counterplay, while White’s plan f2-f4
followed by e4-e5 is very dangerous.
Back to the game.
10…♗b7 11.♗e3 ♖e8 12.♖e1
12.♕e2N is a remarkable idea suggested by the computer. Human
players would find it difficult to move the queen to a square opposite
the rook at e8. Black, to be sure, can open the center, but he cannot
capitalize on the X-ray vision of the rook; e.g. 12…exd4 13.♘xd4 g6
 or 13…♘e5 14.b3 g6 , in each case with play similar to the game
continuation.

12…♕b8
Black does not have any particular problems to solve with his
development. The Serbian grandmaster first places his queen on a
safe square before he opens the position. He does, however, have a
wide choice of good moves:
A) 12…exd4!?N 13.♘xd4 (13.♕xd4 ♘e5=) 13…bxc4! 14.♘f5
♘e5∞;
B) 12…♗f8!?N;
C) We like 12…♕c7N best; e.g. 13.♖c1 exd4 14.♕xd4
(14.♘xd4?! bxc4 15.♘f5 ♘e5 16.♗f1 ♖ad8 ) 14…♘c5 15.♖cd1
♘e6 16.♕d3 ♖ad8, with a complicated position and about equal
chances. All Black’s pieces are harmoniously developed, and in the
event of potential white attempts to break through can set up with
…g7-g6, …♗f8-g7, the (typical for this structure) knight maneuver …
♘e6-c5 and, if necessary, …♘f6-d7-e5.
13.♖c1
This rook move does not yield anything special.
Better was 13.♕e2! exd4 14.♘xd4 ♗f8, after which White, with
15.♘b3! (with the idea ♘a5) 15…♕c7 16.♘d2!, gives good
protection to his only weak point, the c4-pawn, and so can keep up
the pressure on Black’s position. He threatens b2-b4. 16…♖ad8 (it is
difficult for Black to free himself completely; e.g. 16…bxc4 17.♕xc4
c5 18.b4 ) 17.b4

13…exd4!
This is a good moment to open the center.
14.♕xd4
14.♘xd4 bxc4
14…♗f8
The threat …c6-c5, after which Black increases the pressure on the
e4-pawn, provokes White into the following exchange.
15.cxb5
After 15.♕d3, too, Black gets good counterplay: 15…bxc4 16.♕xc4
c5.
15…axb5 16.♕d3 h6
This pawn move should only be played when ♘d4-f5 is not to be
feared. Damljanovic, on the other hand, has prepared the knight
move …♘e5-c4, when the unfortunate rook at c1 blocks the natural
retreat square of the e3-bishop.
16…g6 would be the standard build-up: 17.♗f4 ♘c5 18.♕c2 ♘fd7
17.♖cd1
Now, after …♘e5-c4, the retreat ♗c1 can follow.
17.♘d4 ♘e5 18.♕c2 ♘c4!  19.♗f4 ♘h5 (19…g6)
Best here is 17.♘d2=.
17…♘e5 18.♕c2
18.♘xe5 dxe5 19.♕c2 ♕c8=
18…♗c8
Black clears the b-file so that …b5-b4 is now an option.

18…♘c4 19.♗c1 (19.♗d4 ♘d7) 19…g6. In general, we play only
one of the two moves …h7-h6 or …g7-g6, but not both; the pawn
front is now somewhat softened up. But here, Black has in the
meantime developed queenside pressure, with good prospects, so
that White will hardly be able to exploit the weaknesses on Black’s
kingside.
19.♘d4 ♗d7
After the point has been taken out of the transfer of the knight to
c4, Black now covers the breakthrough-square f5 with the bishop.
The similarity here to the Antoshin Variation is striking, especially
after the exchange of the c4-pawn. The differences between the
Antoshin and the Old Indian are important, of course – in chess,
every 
inconspicuous 
detail 
counts. 
But 
the 
typical 
piece
configurations and plans common to both systems make it easier for
us to understand the various positions.
20.f4
White is practically forced, in view of Black’s initiative on the
queenside, to advance on the other wing. Please note here the great
significance in omitting …g7-g6. With a black pawn on g6, f4-f5
would open the kingside. With the pawn where it is, the kingside
remains closed.

It is also important to note that after 20.♘f5 ♗xf5 21.exf5, the long
diagonal can be closed by 21…d5! .
20…♘c4 21.♗f2 b4!
Again, Black has a wealth of possible continuations. It is all too
natural that without further preparations he goes forward with the
opening of the b-file. The rest of the game was probably influenced
by time constraints. Black was able to expand his initiative and
maintain 
the 
upper 
hand 
tactically 
in 
the 
neck-breaking
complications:
A) 21…c5?! 22.♘dxb5 ♗xb5 23.e5!  ♗d7  24.exf6 ♕xb2
25.♕xb2 ♘xb2 26.♗xa8 ♖xa8 27.♖a1 ;
B) 21…♖a6!?;
C) 21…♕c8 22.g4 ♕c7 White presumably thinks this outweighs
the positive aspects of g3-g4;
D) 21…♕c7!?;
E) 21…♖a5!?
22.axb4 22.♘a2 bxa3 23.♕xc4 axb2 24.♘c3 d5!  22…♕xb4 23.e5 23.b3 ♘a3

♖xh3+ 36.♔g1 ♖xc7 37.♗e5 ♖c8
0-1
Conclusion
The opening of the center with …exd4, after an already successful
expansion with …c7-c6, …a7-a6, …b7-b5 and …♗b7, gives Black a
harmonious development of all his pieces, and pressure against the
white center.

In this game we look at the fianchetto of White’s queen’s bishop,
after which we seek to open the center with …exd4, as in the next
game as well.
But first let’s look at some creative ideas that White can use to
prevent the closing (for as long as possible) of the h1-a8 diagonal,
so that Black cannot get in an early …b7-b5: 8.♕c2 ♖e8 9.♖d1
♕c7 10.h3 ♘f8
analysis diagram
The first player has now done (almost) everything to avoid e2-e4,
but this does not affect Black’s development. With …♘g6, …♗d7
and …♕c8 or …h7-h5 (-h4) the second player can play against
White’s fianchetto position. Meanwhile, it is best to occupy the
center: 11.e4 (11.c5 exd4 12.cxd6 ♗xd6 13.♘xd4 h5!’; 11.♗e3

♗e6 12.b3 h6 and the bishop simply stands badly on e3) 11…♘g6

15.a4 ♖ec8 16.♕b3 h4 17.♖dc1 ♕d8 18.♔h2 hxg3+ 19.fxg3 b6.
Black can combine the fight for the open c-file with maneuvers on
the kingside.
Back to the game.
8…♖e8
9.♗b2
The bishop is not particularly effective on b2, not even after the
opening of its diagonal. But the move affords the first player a
simple development, which is presumably why club players like to
play this way.
9.♕c2 is more often seen. Due to the slowness of b2-b3, both
formations are playable: the expansion with …b7-b5 (Variation  A)
and the knight maneuver …♘d7-f8-g6 (Variation B):
A) 9…♗f8 10.e4 (10.♗b2 a6 11.♖ae1 ♕c7) 10…a6:
A1) 11.a4 a5 with an imminent …exd4, with play similar to Game
30, Laustsen-Zude;

A2) 11.♗b2 b5= 12.dxe5 (12.d5 ♗b7; 12.c5 dxc5 13.dxe5 ♘g4!

B) 9…♕c7 10.♖d1 ♘f8 11.♗b2 ♘g6 12.♖ac1 ♗d7 13.e4 ♕c8
9…exd4N
As so often, we can say, ‘of course’. But, sitting at the board, I once
again had no idea what the precise repertoire move order was – the
number of possible transpositions is too great. Even so, I knew
accurately enough which structure I wanted to adopt against White’s
setup: the open center! Hence my excessive haste in exchanging.
A) 9…e4!?= is quite possible here, but it leads to another class of
positions;
B) 9…a5 10.♕c2 (10.d5 is harmless here; e.g. 10…cxd5 11.cxd5
b6 followed by …♗a6 and …♘c5, with …b6-b5 possibly to follow)
10…exd4 11.♘xd4 g6 is simpler.
10.♘xd4 ♘c5
The knight should of course be stabilized with …a7-a5. At this point
b2-b4 can be permitted, a move that, by the way, runs counter to
White’s idea of developing his pieces simply.

In this game, what we get is a Boleslavsky Wall with an unstable
knight on c5. In the next game we consider a similar structure with
the inclusion of a2-a4 and …a7-a5, after which the knight cannot be
driven away with b3-b4.
A) We do not recommend 10…a5, which allows the immediate
11.♘f5. The trade of the king’s bishop is certainly possible, but it
limits Black’s future possibilities too much: 11.♘f5 ♘c5 12.♘xe7+
♕xe7 13.♕c2 ;
B) 10…g6 followed by …a7-a5 first, and only then …♘c5, was,
however, a good alternative.
11.h3
Sooner or later h2-h3 has to become part of White’s setup, but the
move could be deferred until later.
With 11.b4!? White initiates complications that do not necessarily
favor him. His queenside in the near term is quite fragile and the
bishop at b2 and the b4- and c4-pawns are hanging: 11…♘cd7
(Black does not do himself a favor with the tricky 11…♕b6?!, since
after 12.a3, 12…a5?? does not work on account of 13.bxc5 ♕xb2
14.♘a4!, trapping the queen)
A) 12.♘f5?! is taking it too far: 12…♘e5 13.♘xe7+ ♕xe7
14.♕d4 ♗e6 (14…a5!?) 15.c5 ♘c4  16.cxd6 ♕xd6 17.♕xd6
♘xd6=, when the hole on c4 causes White a lot of trouble;
B) 12.♕b3 consolidates the queenside, but it does not stop
Black’s counterplay: 12…♘b6 13.♖fd1 a5 14.a3 ♗d7∞
11…a5

The formation of the black pawns at d6 and c6 against the white
ones on e4 and c4 was designated by Hans Kmoch the ‘Boleslavsky
Wall’, in recognition of the pioneer of the King’s Indian Defense, the
Ukrainian grandmaster Isaac Boleslavsky. The fact that the second
player in the Old Indian only later reaches for …g7-g6 – the white
knight has to be kept away from f5 – is of only minor importance.
The transition to the Boleslavsky Wall is critical if the knight does not
have permanent access to the support point c5. Here, however, the
passive position of the white queen’s bishop is costly for White.
Instead of going to f4 and pressuring the weak d6-pawn, or to e3,
undermining the setup with …♘c5 and …♕b6, the bishop is hanging
in the air. Black, with …♕b6, can stop the pawn advance a2-a3 and
b3-b4 for long enough until he is ready to apply pressure to the
white center.
12.♕c2 ♕b6

13.♖ad1
White completes his simple setup.
A) 13.♘f5?!, again, is not good, this time because of 13…♗xf5
14.♕xf5 a4!, when the attacking attempt 15.♘e4 fails to 15…
♘fxe4! 16.♗xe4 g6 17.♕f3 axb3 , with White simply a full pawn
down;
B) 13.a3!? is sensible. But with 13…♘e6, Black can trade the
knight, which for many moves would be insecurely placed at c5.
After 14.♘xe6 (14.♘f5 ♘c5!=) 14…♗xe6 Black’s development is
complete and the game revolves around the b3-pawn, which is just
as vulnerable as the weakness on d6. In this structure the white
queen’s bishop generally goes to f4. Here is a sample variation that
demonstrates how quickly tactical chaos can break out in a
supposedly harmless position: 15.♖fd1 ♘d7 (15…d5!?) 16.♘e4
♗f5 17.♕c3 f6 18.b4 ♕c7 19.g4 ♗g6 20.g5 ♗f8 21.gxf6 ♖xe4
22.♗xe4 (22.fxg7 ♗e7 23.♗xe4 ♗xe4 24.♕g3∞) 22…♗xe4
23.♕g3 ♘xf6! (23…♘e5 24.♗xe5 dxe5 25.♕g4! ♗g6 26.♖d7 )
24.♗xf6 ♕f7=, with more exciting play to come.
13…g6
This gives us our standard setup.
With 13…a4 the first player can be burdened with a weak pawn on
b3. This can lead to the opening of the a-file for the a8-rook and
pushes a possible b3-b4 out into the distance – although over the

long term the move cannot be prevented. For example, 14.♖b1!
axb3 15.axb3 g6 16.♖fd1 ♗f8 17.♗c1! ♘e6 18.♗e3 ♕c7 19.b4! .
In hindsight it is not all that good an idea to be active too early on
the queenside.
14.e4?!
The first player, too, goes into the standard setup. But the pawn
move gives his opponent objects of attack – for one, the e4-pawn
itself, for another the d4-square, which, after the fianchetto of the
black king’s bishop, will be subject to constant threats. White’s
pieces, mainly the bishop on b2, are simply not well placed for this
structure.
A) It was better to aim at driving away the c5-knight with 14.a3.
14…♘fd7 (just as in the Antoshin Variation the knight goes to e5 in
the event that White increases the pressure on the d6-pawn with
♗f4. In the Boleslavsky Wall formation the e5-knight has an
additional function, that of targeting the c4-pawn) 15.♖b1 ♗f8
16.♖fd1 ♗g7 17.♗c1 ♘e5∞ 18.b4?! axb4 19.axb4 ♘e6  and the
c4-pawn is weak;
B) 14.e3!?, too, is an interesting concept. White avoids giving his
opponent objects of attack. Yet he isn’t threatening anything and
Black should be able to complete his development in peace. For

instance: 14…a4 15.♖b1 ♗f8 16.♖fd1 axb3 17.axb3 ♗g7 18.♗c1
♕c7 19.b4 ♘e6 20.♘f3! ♘f8∞
14…a4! 15.♔h2 ♗f8
Meanwhile, b3-b4 has become unrealistic. And, the b3- and e4-
pawns must be protected, which ties down the knights on c3 and d4.
The bishop on b2 has been downgraded to a mere extra.
16.f4?!
White could have shaken off the pressure with 16.♘xa4 ♘xa4
17.bxa4 ♗g7, with a tenable position. But one is hardly willing to go
on the defensive after only 15 moves.
16…♗g7
16…axb3 17.axb3 ♗g7  is more energetic.

Now the dream position in the Boleslavsky Wall has been reached:
Black’s pressure against e4 and b3 is much more significant than the
‘weakness’ of the d6-pawn – White’s pieces are not in a position to
attack it. And yet in such positions caution is called for. After …g7-g6
White can use the lever f4-f5 (which is now possible) to attack on
the kingside.
17.♘xa4 ♘xa4 18.bxa4 ♕b4
Black wins back the pawn he has invested and gets the advantage
on the queenside, which compensates very well for the weak d6-
pawn. The chances are even.
The idea of the tactical shot 18…♘xe4!? did not occur to me during
the game. This is just as well: there is great danger in the
calculation of unnecessary complications, and in falling into time
pressure by searching for the very best move: 19.♖fe1 (19.♗xe4
♖xe4 20.♕xe4 ♕xb2+ ) 19…♘f6 20.♕b3!∞
19.♘b3?!
Now White loses the thread. Certainly, he has promised himself a
great deal from the upcoming e4-e5 – Black’s king’s knight will be
driven to h5, where it can be trapped. Even so, it is evident that the
second player, thanks to the open white king position, can ignore the
g3-g4 threat for a long time in favor of his attack on the queenside.
Correct was 19.a5!.
19…♖xa4

20.e5?!
20.♗d4 was better.
20…dxe5?!
20…♖xa2!? was more accurate, but also very complicated:
A) 21.♖xd6 ♗f5  (21…♘d7 22.♖fd1 ♘c5! 23.♖d8 ♖f8!);
B) 21.exf6 ♗xf6 22.♗c3 ♕a3 23.♕xa2  ♕xa2 24.♗xf6
Best, however, was 20…♗f5, forcing the exchange of queens and
minimizing the danger to the black king: 21.♕d2 ♕xd2 22.♖xd2
dxe5 23.♗xe5 ♘e4 24.♗xe4 ♗xe4 25.♗xg7 ♔xg7 26.♘c5 ♖xc4
27.♘xb7 ♖e6!
21.fxe5 ♘h5!?
Preventing the opening of Black’s kingside and preparing …♗e6. The
knight is made safe by the tactical counter-blows on the long
diagonal against the threat g3-g4.
It is likely that my opponent expected 21…♘d7 22.e6! ♖xe6
23.♗xg7 ♔xg7 , when White has dangerous practical counter-
chances.

22.♕f2
The queen move aims at f7 and covers the important dark squares
g3 and f4 as well. Still, it does not threaten to win the knight with
g3-g4.
A) 22.g4? ♖xa2–+ 23.gxh5 ♗xe5+ does not work at all;
B) 22.a3! was best. As the black forces have been diverted to the
queenside for the purpose of winning material, the opening of the
kingside is most dangerous. During the game I had no inkling of this
move and of the ensuing tricky variations – thank God! 22…♖xa3
(22…♕xc4 23.♕f2! ♕xb3 24.♗d5 ♕xg3+ 25.♕xg3 ♘xg3
26.♗xf7+ ♔h8 27.♖f6! ♗xf6 28.exf6 ♖f8 29.♗b3 ♘h5 30.♗xa4
♗e6!) 23.♕f2 ♗e6 24.♘c5! ♖aa8 25.♘xe6 fxe6 26.♖a1!
22…♕e7
Now the danger of a surprise attack is averted. Since the knight is
safe on h5 for a few more moves, Black can consolidate the extra
pawn. The rest of the game was not without error, but I was able to
realize my advantage.

Conclusion
The opening of the center with …exd4 can also be played without
the prior …c7-c6, …a7-a6, …b7-b5 and …♗b7, even when the knight
at c5 has not been permanently secured. But Black must exert
pressure on the queenside (against b3 or c4) as well as in the
center.

Boris Avrukh recommends this build-up in his highly regarded series
Grandmaster Repertoire, in which he analyzes (2010) a very
powerful white repertoire with 1.d4. In his main variation, White
opts for ♖ad1 and a later f2-f4, and after …g7-g6 and …♗f8-g7
attacks on the kingside with f4-f5.
12…♘c5
13.♖e1
Here my opponent avoids Avrukh’s book variation. But this is of little
relevance here, as the character of the position is not essentially
changed.
13.♕c2 is Avrukh’s repertoire move; he doesn’t mention 13 …♕b6
(he gives 13…♗f8). Black is quite safe on the queenside for the long
term, but after the practically inevitable …g7-g6 he has to reckon
with the advance of White’s f-pawn, f2-f4, after which the opening of
the kingside with f4-f5 or e4-e5 is in the air. But in general, Black
has good defensive chances in this type of position, or even for
going over to a counter-attack. Typical here is the knight maneuver
…♘f6-d7-d5, restricting the white pieces to the protection of d3, or
provoking White to play f2-f4, when Black will get pressure on the

e4-pawn. Over the long term the second player can double his rooks
on the e-file and play for the lever …f7-f5. Here are a few sample

A typical sacrifice in this type of position. Black gets two pawns right
away, a third (f6) is very weak, and the open white king position
invites Black to transfer his queen to the kingside;
C) 14.♖ab1 g6 15.♖fd1 ♗f8 16.b3 ♘fd7∞ In view of the
weakness at b3 White finds it difficult to get active play on the
kingside.

13…♗f8
The bishop clears the e-file, but is also ready to be fianchettoed on
g7, with pressure on the long diagonal. The immediate 13…g6 is also
good.
14.♕c2 ♕b6 15.♖e2
Laustsen would like to place the rooks on the e- and f-files before
becoming active with f2-f4.
15.♖ad1 is solid, but after 15…g6 it is unclear how White is to
proceed. Even Artur Jussupow, who was one of the great players in
the 1980s and 1990s – among other accomplishments a three-time
semi-finalist in the Candidates Tournament – in hindsight did not
care for White’s position. 16.f4 ♘fd7 17.♗f2 ½-½ (28) Jussupow-
Hickl, Switzerland tt 2016. After 17…♕b4N 18.b3 ♗g7  play could
take a course similar to that in the main game.
15…g6
This move definitely belongs in Black’s build-up. Here it is more
important to deny the white knight the f5-square than it is to create
the possibility of bringing the bishop to g7.

16.♖f1
With the clear intention f2-f4.
16.♖d1 is the alternative. The pressure in the center is intended to
make it difficult for Black to develop. But because of the weakness at
b3, Black can free himself bit by bit. Here is a sample variation, with
a few typical ideas for getting play: 16…♘fd7 17.♖ed2 ♘b8 18.b3
♘ba6 19.♕b2!? ♗e6!  (19…♗d7?! 20.♘db5! ) 20.♗f4 h6 (20…
♖ad8 21.♗g5) 21.♘db5!, with a tactically complicated game, and
with about equal chances:
A) 21…cxb5?! 22.♖xd6 (a typical trick: the black queen doesn’t
have enough squares!) 22…♗xd6 23.♖xd6 ♘d3! (23…♕c7
24.♖xa6 ) 24.♖xd3 bxc4 25.♘b5 ;
B) 21…♖ed8!?∞ If White grabs on d6, the b3-pawn also falls.
16…♗g7
Black has set up his ideal formation and doesn’t have to cover his
weakness at d6 because of his pressure on the e4-pawn. It should
be noted that with this structure the black queen’s bishop often has
to stay longer on its starting square since the knights need the d7-
square for maneuvering. Otherwise, if Black had three moves
available for further development he could play …♗d7, …♖ad8 and
…♗c8. The doubling of the rooks on the e-file might be possible,
but typically this should follow only after the double-step of the
white f-pawn.

17.♖d1
The first player backs off from immediate action on the kingside. In
view of White’s solid structure, this is a sound practical decision. He
can try first to improve his position, for example with ♔h1 or the
doubling of the rooks on the d-file.
17.f4 ♗d7!? (17…♘h5 18.♔h2 ♕b4 19.♘a2 ♕b6=) 18.♖d1 ♖ad8
19.g4 ♗c8=
17…♘fd7
A typical knight maneuver in the Boleslavsky Wall. Also, the c4-pawn
is vulnerable; if White protects it with b2-b3, the d4-knight is tied to
its protection. A tricky situation!
17…♗d7?! 18.♘f3!
18.f4
White prevents …♘e5, but now his king position is somewhat airy,
and the e4-pawn can no longer be protected by f2-f3.
18…♘f6
Provoking f2-f4 was worth the two tempi spent on it.
We should not forget that Black is still quite backward in his
development: his rooks are not connected. As they say, be careful
when grabbing pawns! 18…♕b4? 19.♘db5!  cxb5 20.♘d5 ♕xc4!

♘xe4 22.♘xe8 ♘xg3
19.♗f2 ♕b4

An important component in Black’s plan of deployment: the
vulnerability of White’s structure compels him to make concessions.
There is no easy and comfortable way to protect the c4-pawn.
19…♗d7? is impossible because of 20.e5! .
20.♗f1
20.e5!? dxe5 21.♖xe5 ♗f8 22.♖xe8 ♘xe8 23.b3
A difficult dynamic balance is the result. At first glance, Black’s space
disadvantage and unfinished development may seem significant. On
closer inspection, however, one discovers a variety of ways to put
White under pressure.
20…h5
A double-edged move! In addition to the obvious disadvantage of
loosening the black king position, the white lever f4-f5 gains massive
power – it has numerous advantages. First, g3-g4 is permanently
stopped, which would constrict Black. Furthermore, the …h5-h4
lever may possibly come into consideration, weakening the f4-pawn
and, after g3-g4, a piece sacrifice on g4 is in the realm of possibility.
But in the game a different theme is at work: after the hasty
advance e4-e5, …dxe5, fxe5, the f6-knight gets an important retreat
square at h7, from which it may go, among other locations, to g5.
My opponent apparently underestimated this possibility.

Other options here are 20…♘fd7 21.♘db5 cxb5 22.♘d5 ♕xc4∞,
20…♘h5!?, 20…♖e7!? and 20…♗d7!?.
21.e5?!
In a tense situation, White does not find the right moment to strike
out. After this hasty advance, the weakness at d6 disappears, while
numerous gaps open up in the white camp.
Best here was the not-so-intuitive 21.♘f3!?, with the possible
consequence 21…♘fxe4! 22.♖xe4 ♘xe4 23.♘xe4 ♗f5 24.♗d3 d5!
25.♘c5 ♗xd3 26.♘xd3 ♕xc4 27.♕xc4 dxc4 28.♘de5 ♖ad8 , with
further suspenseful play.
21…dxe5 22.fxe5?!
This was of course White’s intent.
22.♖xe5 is better, however: 22…♖xe5 23.fxe5 ♘e8
22…♘h7
The 21.e5 advance has not paid off, but on the contrary has helped
Black’s pieces to get good squares; they are now active and working
well together. In the game, Black’s initiative continued to increase.

Conclusion
This game illustrates some important ideas in the Boleslavsky Wall.
With his knight securely placed on c5 by the sequence a2-a4, …a6-
a5, Black can exert pressure on the white structure to compensate
for his space disadvantage and the weakness on d6.
Section 3: The system ♗g5 and e2-e3
The white development with 5.♗g5 and 6.e3 requires special
handling on the part of the second player. White develops his
queen’s bishop actively before closing the pawn chain with e2-e3,

supporting the d4-pawn. But sooner or later Black can simplify the
game with an exchange of the dark-squared bishops.
Game 31
Rustem Dautov 2608
Jörg Hickl 2589
Switzerland tt 2003
1.d4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.c4 ♘bd7 4.♘c3 e5
Hickl unhesitatingly allows 5.♗g5. There is no particular reason for
Black to evade the ♗g5 system, but there is a comfortable way to
do this with 4…c6. After this move, White generally opts for a
different plan of development. But if he persists with 5.♗g5 h6
6.♗h4, he will miss having the bishop on the queenside, so that
Black, perhaps with 6…b5!?N, can fight for the initiative there; e.g.
7.cxb5 cxb5 8.♘xb5 g5 9.♗g3 ♖b8 .
5.♗g5
This simple way of playing is often recommended in order to give
Black as few leverage points as possible for counterplay: the d4-
square is well supported by the ensuing e2-e3 and all the white
pieces are harmoniously and actively placed. Also, White’s structure
makes complete sense and requires a somewhat different approach
on the part of the second player than in the main variation, in which

sooner or later the weakness of the d4-square usually plays a part.
On the other hand, the bishop on g5 does not exert any real
pressure and is a candidate for early exchange operations that
mitigate the problem of Black’s space deficiency.
5…♗e7 6.e3
In this game the second player simplifies the game by immediately
withdrawing the f6-knight. In the next game, the exchange takes
place somewhat later.
6…♘g8
A rare move that is seldom mentioned in opening books. This simple
line leaves White with a slight advantage in space and development,
but Black gets a solid position with few points of attack.
6…0-0 is the main variation; see the game Vaisser-Istratescu.
7.♗xe7 ♘xe7
Recapturing with the queen looks more harmonious, but it doesn’t
work tactically!
7…♕xe7? Here, Black’s obviously delayed development makes a
negative impression: 8.c5! dxc5 9.♘b5! ♘b8 10.dxe5 ♘h6! 11.♖c1
8.♕c2
8.♗e2 is a recommendation of Ukrainian grandmaster Andrey
Sumets in his article in Chessbase Magazine 165 (2015). The rare
8…♘c6 is not analyzed by Sumets. Black should be able to
compensate over the long term for his space disadvantage and
backwardness in development. For example, 9.♕c2 0-0 10.0-0N
(10.0-0-0 ♖e8 11.♗d3 ♘f6 12.dxe5 ♘xe5 13.♘xe5 ♖xe5 ) 10…
exd4 11.exd4 , analogous to the variation 9.♖d1.
8…♘c6

9.0-0-0
Rustem Dautov, a very solid grandmaster, sharpens the play. In view
of his good control of the center, the planned kingside pawn storm is
very much a possibility. Still, Black now gets good counter-chances.
With the quiet 9.♖d1, White, without risk, can keep his slight
advantage for a while longer. But Black would not have any great
dangers 
to 
overcome. 
The 
following 
instructive 
variations
demonstrate some ideas about how Black can successfully complete
his development. 9…exd4 and now:
A) 10.♘xd4 ♘xd4 11.♖xd4 (11.exd4 0-0 12.♗e2 ♘f6 13.0-0
♖e8 14.♖fe1 c6 ) 11…0-0 12.♗d3 h6 13.0-0 a5 14.♖d1 ♘c5
15.h3 ♗e6 ;
B) 10.exd4 0-0 11.♗e2 ♘f6 12.h3 ♘e7 (12…d5 13.0-0 )
13.♗d3 ♘g6 (13…c6 14.0-0 d5 15.b3 ) 14.0-0 ♘f4 15.♖fe1 ♘xd3
16.♕xd3 ♗d7
9…0-0 10.♗d3
10.a3N is less energetic; this positional way of handling the position
is better suited to castling kingside: 10…exd4 11.exd4 ♘f6 12.h3
(12.d5 ♘e7 13.h3 c6 ) 12…d5

The concept is simple and good. White attacks the h7-pawn and
after the weakening of Black’s structure looks to open the g- and/or
h-file with a pawn storm. On 10…g7-g6, h2-h4-h5 should follow;
10…h7-h6 is answered by g2-g4-g5. In this type of position White is
usually prepared to invest one or two pawns for the attack down the
g- and h-files.
10…g6
Hickl decides to shore up the light squares with …f7-f5, after which
the seventh rank is opened for the sake of defense. After the early
exchange of the dark-squared bishops, which is generally quite
agreeable for Black, the second player’s king nearly always finds
refuge on a dark square, and his pawn chain is not easy to break
though.
Since the weakening of the structure cannot be avoided anyway, the
counter-attack with 10…♘b4!N is a possibility. With the loss of the
h-pawn Black also loses an important building block in his kingside
battlement. On the other hand, with the disappearance of the light-
squared bishop, an important attacker is removed from the board. At
the same time, the knight move clears the way for the counter-
thrust …c7-c6 followed by …b7-b5, by which Black opens files
against the white king position. In the following tactically demanding
sample variations the chances are about even: 11.♗xh7+ ♔h8:

A) 12.♕b1 g6 13.a3 ♘c6 14.♗xg6 fxg6 15.♕xg6 ♕f6
16.♕h5+ ♔g8 17.♘d5 ♕g7 18.♘xc7 ♘f6! 19.♕g5 ♖b8  At first
glance, White’s material preponderance, four pawns for only a piece,
seems convincing. But on closer analysis it becomes clear that
Black’s pieces are becoming active, which – especially in view of the
fact that the white rooks do not have open lines – constitutes good
compensation for Black;
B) 12.♕b3 exd4 13.exd4 ♘xa2+ 14.♕xa2 ♔xh7 15.h4 ♘f6
16.♘g5+ ♔g8 17.f3 c6 18.g4 b5∞
11.a3 f5
Jörg fortifies his kingside with the pawn chain h7-g6-f5-e4, so that
he can complete his development. Still, the lever g2-g4 gains in
power.
12.♗e2 e4 13.♘d2 ♘f6
14.h3
Sumets rightly considers this position advantageous for White. Black,
however, has enough resources for a successful defense. Despite the
relatively early draw, the game remains very complicated.
14…♘e7 15.♖hg1?! 15.g4!?; 15.♖dg1!? 15…c6! 16.g4 d5 17.g5 ♘e8
18.f4 exf3 19.♗xf3 19.♘xf3 f4 20.exf4 ♘g7 21.♕d2 ♘h5 22.h4 ♘xf4 23.♘e5

½-½

Conclusion
With the early exchange 6…♘g8 Black cedes the first player a small
advantage in space and development. But he gets a solid position,
one quite capable of defending itself.
Game 32
Anatoly Vaisser 2533
Andrei Istratescu 2623
Mulhouse 2011
1.d4 ♘f6 2.c4 d6 3.♘c3
3…e5
The French grandmaster Anatoly Vaisser (born in the Soviet Union)
is regarded as an expert in the Four Pawns Attack of the King’s
Indian, in which the knight is developed to f3 only after f2-f4. It is
possible that the Romanian grandmaster Andrei Istratescu is
avoiding just this variation, and therefore chooses this line.
3…♘bd7 4.♘f3 e5 is our repertoire line – or 4…c6, if Black prefers
to avoid the system with 5.♗g5.
4.♘f3
For anyone who plays against the normal systems in the King’s
Indian without an early ♘f3, this is an unpleasant situation. Only
with this move can White really hope for an opening advantage.

The variation 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.♕xd8+ ♔xd8 is harmless for the
second player. The play proceeds according to patterns similar to
those we analyzed for the Endgame Variation in Chapter 1. To keep
our repertoire as small as possible, we forgo a more thorough
treatment of this line.
4…♘bd7 5.♗g5
5.e4 leads, after 5…♗e7, to our Old Indian. After 5…g6, White has
to be satisfied with a quiet King’s Indian without a chance for an
early f2-f4. Perhaps Grandmaster Vaisser does not care for this.
5…♗e7 6.e3 c6
A) We saw 6…♘g8 in the game Dautov-Hickl;
B) 6…h6 7.♗h4 (7.♗xf6 ♗xf6 is harmless; e.g. 8.♗d3 0-0 9.0-0
exd4 10.exd4 ♘b6 11.♖e1 ♗e6 12.b3 d5 13.c5 ♘d7=, with good
play – White’s space advantage plays no role here, as Black’s pieces
all find good squares, e.g. with …♖e8, …c7-c6 and …♕c7) 7…0-0 is
likewise a reasonable line. But here it is no longer possible to effect
the exchange of bishops with …♘e8, as the white bishop escapes to
g3.
In the next two or three moves White has to settle on a scheme of
development. He can strive to castle either queenside or kingside.
7.♗d3

A flexible move, postponing the decision about where to castle. But
the bishop can come under attack by the pawn push …e5-e4, which
is why it is developed more modestly at e2.
A) With 7.♕c2, too, White keeps his options open about the
various developmental possibilities available to him: 7…0-0 8.0-0-0
(8.♗e2 h6 9.♗h4 ♖e8 10.0-0 ♘h5 11.♗xe7 ♕xe7 ; cf. the
deviation 9.0-0, going into the main game; there, the white king’s
bishop stands on d3 and is later withdrawn to e2)
analysis diagram
Queenside castling looks aggressive, but Black can clarify the
situation in the center (just as he can after White castles on the
other side) – after which White does not get a kingside attack: 8…
exd4 (the insertion of 8…h6 9.♗h4 is also possible here: 9…exd4
10.♘xd4 ♘c5, with play similar to that in Variation A2) 9.♘xd4:
A1) 9.exd4 d5! After the transition to an isolani structure the
presence of the white king on the queenside does not make a good
impression! 10.♔b1 (10.cxd5 ♘xd5 11.♗xe7 ♘xe7 ) 10…dxc4N (an
attempt to improve the line. Sumets analyzes 10…♘e4!?; Black still
has some problems to solve) 11.♗xc4 ♘b6:
A11) 12.♗b3?! a5 13.a3 a4 14.♗a2 (14.♘xa4? ♘xa4 15.♗xa4

A12) 12.♗d3 h6 13.♗xf6 (13.h4 ♗g4 ) 13…♗xf6 In view of the
bad position of his king, White should be on the lookout for a way to
reach equality.
A2) 9.♘xd4 9.♘xd4 Now we again find ourselves in the well-
known Boleslavsky Wall. Both the restraint of the e-pawn and
queenside castling, however, facilitate Black’s game. 9…♘c5 (this is
where the knight belongs. 9…a5 10.♘f5 is less clear) 10.h3 (in view
of the open position of his king, White will of course refrain from the
immediate b2-b4: 10.b4?! ♘a6 11.a3 c5! ):
A21) 10…♘fe4 is playable, although this is not entirely without
problems: 11.♘xe4 ♘xe4 12.♗f4!  (Sumets; 12.♗xe7 ♕xe7
13.♗d3  1-0 (39) Georgiev-Janev, Toulon 1999);
A22) Black can perhaps improve with the less intuitive 10…h6N.
11.♗h4 (11.♗f4 – this variation can be avoided with the
interpolation 8…h6 9.♗h4 – 11…♘e6∞) 11…a5 12.♗g3 and Black
can initiate the usual queenside motif in the Boleslavsky Wall, with
the difference that here, with the white king on this side of the
board, a worthwhile attacking goal is beckoning: 12…a4 13.a3
(13.♔b1 a3 14.b3 ♘a6! ) 13…♕b6
B) 7.♗e2 0-0 (generally speaking, in the system with 5.♗g5 and
6.e3 we should bear in mind that the queenside expansion with …
c7-c6, …a7-a6 and …b7-b5 comes to nothing, since White’s center is
too well secured and after …b5-b4 the c3-knight can always escape
to e4, where it is better placed; here is a sample variation: 7…a6
8.♕c2 b5 9.dxe5 dxe5 10.0-0 b4 11.♘e4! ) 8.0-0 ♘e8 9.♗xe7
♕xe7 10.b4 e4 11.♘d2 f5
Back to the game.

7…h6
This pawn move is generally useful for Black: he makes an air hole,
the h-pawn gets away from the ♗d3/♕c2 battery, it drives away the
white queen’s bishop, and accomplishes all this with gain of tempo.
The danger lies in the fact that White could castle queenside and
perhaps even follow up with the pawn sacrifice g2-g4. It is true that
this plan, which we know from the Antoshin Variation, is not so easy
for White to carry out in this position. Still, it remains an open
question whether the pawn move should be played immediately or
later on.
7…0-0 8.♕c2 h6 and now:
A) After 9.h4 Black must not of course grab the bishop. Instead,
he captures in the center and in the future has the g4-square
available whenever he wants to make use of it: 9…exd4 10.♘xd4
♘e5 ;
B) 9.♗xf6 ♗xf6∞ Black’s chances are not worse. The theme here
is that the black king’s bishop, which at first glance is not very
impressive, can become very strong even when the center is closed
(d4-d5), as it no longer has an opposite number. We investigate this
theme further in Game 38, Piankov-Zude, in Chapter 5;
C) 9.♗h4 exd4 10.exd4 d5=, transposing to the game
continuation.
8.♗h4 0-0

9.♕c2
After this Black gets in the central advance …d6-d5, with obvious
equality, since White cannot support the pawn chain d4/c5 because
of the rook hanging on a1.
Somewhat better is 9.0-0 ♘h5 (but not 9…♘e8?!, when White
profits from the interpolation of the moves …h7-h6, ♗h4: 10.♗g3 ;
9…exd4 does not work particularly well here because of 10.exd4 d5
11.c5 b6 12.b4 ; the long-term space advantage on the queenside
and the weakness at c6 give White the advantage) 10.♗xe7 ♕xe7
11.♕c2 ♖e8 and now:
A) 12.♖ad1 ♘hf6 White has to deal with the threat …e5-e4, after
which Black can complete his development in various ways; e.g.
13.♘d2 ♘f8 (13…a6!? 14.♖fe1 ♖b8; 13…d5!?) 14.h3 ♗e6 15.b3
♖ad8 16.♖fe1 b6 ;

C) 12.♖fe1N ♘hf6 13.♘d2 ♘b6 14.h3 d5
9…exd4
Black can saddle his opponent with an isolani, which we may
assume is not to the taste of most adherents of the 5.♗g5 system.

9…♘h5 10.♗xe7 ♕xe7 is also playable, and is somewhat more in
the style of our repertoire. See the variations after the deviation 9.0-
0 in the main game.
10.exd4
After 10.♘xd4 Black equalizes: 10…♘c5 11.♗e2 ♘ce4 12.♘xe4
♘xe4 13.♗xe7 ♕xe7=
10…d5 11.0-0
There is no promising alternative to this. The point is that White,
after 11.c5 b6 12.b4 a5!, cannot maintain the constricting pawn

Conclusion
The main variation of the 5.♗g5 system causes Black hardly any
problems if he chooses the proper setup. The positions after the
bishop exchange with …♘h5, in which White keeps a lead in
development, as well as the isolani positions, do not promise him a
pleasant game.

Section 4: White plays an early d4-d5
Against our repertoire line 1.d4 d6 2.c4 e5 White can close the
center already on the third move; of course this can also occur later
on. Thanks to the fixed center, both sides can initiate operations on
the flanks. A white pawn storm on the kingside, together with
queenside castling, is usually answered by a black counter-attack on
the queenside, often even before castling.
To come to a better assessment of the early closing of the center in
the Old Indian with d4-d5, we explain the logic of the early moves in
the main variation of the King’s Indian.

7.0-0 ♘c6 8.d5 ♘e7
Black, with the bishop fianchetto, the …e7-e5 advance and the move
…♘c6, has put consistent pressure on the d4-square, and it is
counted as a success for Black that White gives way and relinquishes
the central tension with d4-d5. Black even accepts that his knight on
e7 has been left stranded, making further, extensive maneuvers
necessary. Under the protection of the secure center he starts his
typical wing attack: …♘f6-d7 followed by …f7-f5. What does all this
have to do with the Old Indian?

Game 33
Manuel Valles 2317
Jörg Hickl 2588
Switzerland tt 2015
1.d4 d6 2.c4 e5 3.d5
White has resolved the tension in the center with the immediate d4-
d5, so Black has to fianchetto his bishop and develop his knight to a
square that at first is passive, as in the King’s Indian. Black can,
among other ideas, develop the bishop to e7 right away (which, by
the way, in the King’s Indian often occurs only after protracted
maneuvers) and threaten the immediate exchange with …♗e7-g5.
In brief: the early d4-d5 advance does gain space for White, but it
also makes it easier for Black to find a good plan of development.
Yet we should not underestimate the white space advantage: if Black
does not find counterplay, White will typically have the advantage,
even in quiet positions!
3…g6
Jörg Hickl decides, first, to trade off the king’s bishop. But the pawn
move has additional advantages. For one, the king finds a safe
square at g7, and for another the pawn supports the transfer of the
knight to h5. Also, the lever …f7-f5, followed by taking back with g-

pawn, becomes another option – which, after thorough preparation,
can later play a role.
3…f5 is a popular alternative. But we don’t like the fact that White
gets the chance to fight for the nice e4-square; e.g. 4.e4 fxe4 5.♘c3
♘f6 6.♘ge2, when Black must play accurately in the already
simplified position. This line is recommended by Francisco Vallejo
Pons on chess24.com, where he analyzes it further.
4.e4 ♘d7 5.♘e2
The knight is uncomfortably placed here, but even on g3 it would
not cut a good figure. Developing the knight with ♘d2 and ♘3c3 is
certainly all right, but it would block the queen’s bishop, which
seems somewhat inharmonious.
A more natural development promises better chances of a small
opening advantage; e.g. 5.♘c3 a5 6.♗d3 h5 7.♘f3 (7.h4 ♗h6
8.♗c2 ♘c5= 1-0 (62) Speelman-McNab, London 1992) 7…♗h6
8.a3 ♗xc1 9.♕xc1 h4 10.b4 ♔f8 , with play on both wings.
5…h5 6.♘ec3 ♗h6
7.♘d2
Manuel Valles saves his good bishop in order to leave the
grandmaster with his bad bishop. But this blocks an important
diagonal, past the dark-square pawn chain, that is very valuable in
the middlegame. For instance, the otherwise typical lever f2-f4 for

opening the f-file no longer comes into the discussion. On the other
hand, the queen’s bishop will not be very effective at b2.
7.♗xh6 is more natural: 7…♘xh6 8.♗d3 a5 9.0-0 ♔f8 10.♘d2
♔g7 11.h3 h4= White’s spatial superiority is not much of a factor,
since Black finds good squares for all his pieces.
7…♔f8
For the king there is no better square in sight than g7, with the
optimal development of the g8-knight and the h8-rook not yet
determined.
8.a3 ♔g7
9.b4
The logical result of the build-up begun with 7.♘d2. White pushes
forward on the queenside, and later will open the c-file there with
c4-c5. Like the black king on the other wing, the white king should
be safe enough on the queenside. This is a concept often seen in the
King’s Indian, which in this case, however, is unconvincing because
of the poor coordination of the white pieces.
9…h4
Black gains space on the kingside. So long as he is the one who
decides whether and where the position is opened on this side, he
can march forward without risk. With the text move, the h5-square
(among others) is freed up for the knight. After the exchange of the

dark-squared bishops, which cannot be avoided in the long run, the
outpost f4 will beckon.
10.♕c2?!
White prepares queenside castling – not a good idea.
Better was 10.♘b3 ♗xc1 11.♕xc1 ♘gf6 12.♗e2 followed by
castling kingside, with about equal chances for both sides.
10…a5 11.♗b2
We have reached a critical position. Black’s development on the
kingside has progressed considerably; but now he has to decide how
he would like to unfold his queenside. A helpful general piece of
advice for this closed central structure: keep an eye on both sides of
the board! Occasionally, the position can be opened on a part of the
board where the opponent has more space at his disposal; the
concrete position of the pieces is what is decisive here.
11…b6
With this move Black renounces active operations on the queenside.
A later …c7-c6 would weaken the black formation and make it
vulnerable. Instead, White’s advance is held up for as long as
possible.
11…c6!? is well worth considering. Naturally, Black does not want to
simply take on d5, which after …c6xd5, c4xd5 would make the c4-
square available to the knight standing uncomfortably on d2. The

idea behind …c7-c6 is that Black can take advantage of White’s
momentarily insecure position on the queenside by getting his queen
to b6, now that the path to it has been opened. After …c7-c6, Black
can hardly castle queenside.
12.0-0-0?
The young Frenchman, who has since become an International
Master, stays true to the plan he has prepared. But it would have
been better for him to go back to the ‘normal’ scheme of
development by castling kingside.
After e.g. 12.h3 ♘gf6 13.♗e2 ♗g5 14.♘f3 ♘h5 15.0-0 ♘f4  a
typical position is reached in which both sides have good play.
12…axb4 13.axb4  ♕f6?!
The queen move provokes the following marked weakening of the
white pawn structure, but it allows his opponent concrete play on
the other side of the board.
13…♘gf6 or 13…♘df6 was better. The idea here is to open the
queenside with the lever …c7-c6, since White cannot very well
capture; e.g. 13…♘df6 14.h3 ♘e7 15.♔b1 c6!. In view of the airy
white king position and the weaknesses at d4 and b4, Black takes
over the initiative, despite the resulting weaknesses at d5, b5 and
b6: 16.♘f3 (16.♗d3?! b5!) 16…cxd5 17.cxd5 b5! . The opening of
the queenside does not do White’s king any good!
14.f3?
White surrenders to his fate, but after the following move his
structure is permanently destroyed.
With 14.♘b5! the first player has a tactical solution that, in a
practical game, could be found only with difficulty: 14…♗b7
15.♔b1!∞ (15.♘xc7 ♖c8 16.♘b5 ♗a6 )
14…h3!  15.♔b1 hxg2 16.♗xg2

Both sides are attacking on the side where their own kings live.
Because of his space advantage, White is not in any immediate
danger. But the weaknesses at h4 and, especially, f4, make White’s
defense on the kingside hopeless in the long run; at some point,
Black will win a pawn there. The further course of the game is a
good example of the exploitation of permanent weaknesses, when
the opponent has no counterplay to speak of. Here, it is not
important to find the quickest or most forcing way to the win, but
the most certain!

Conclusion
The closing of the center with 3.d4-d5 allows Black among others
the exchange of the king’s bishop with 3…g7-g6 and a later …♗f8-

h6. Then Black has good chances to reach a level game despite his
slight shortage of space.

Black uses the attacking tempo to establish his knight on c5 on the
next move with …a7-a5. The knight will be stable there for a time,
although in the long term there is the danger that White will drive it
away with b2-b3, a2-a3 and b3-b4, which, however, will require
thorough preparation.
With 5…♗e7, Black can also follow the standard setup.

6.f3
White builds up his game in the style of the Sämisch System in the
King’s Indian. After reinforcing the center, he develops in the usual
way with ♗e3, ♕d2 and queenside castling, giving him a free hand
for a dangerous kingside attack. The exchange ♗c1-e3xc5, on the
other hand, is seldom a good option despite the doubled pawn on
c5, as the move f2-f3 has weakened too many dark squares.
A) With 6.♕c2 White aims for a similar setup. As in the game
continuation, Black, with the maneuver …♗f8-e7-g5, can try to
exchange the dark-squared bishops, which especially after g2-g4

would reveal the obvious weaknesses in White’s camp; e.g. 6…a5
7.♗e3 ♗e7 8.♘f3 b6 9.h3 ♗d7 10.♗e2 0-0 11.g4?! (11.0-0 h6
12.♘h2 ♘h7 13.♗g4N ♗e8!? ) 11…h6 12.0-0-0 ♘h7 . Black has
the better structure, without granting White substantial attacking
chances;
B) 6.♗d3 poses the question of whether Black should exchange
his fine c5-knight for the (at first) very ineffective bishop at d3. In
general: yes! Certainly Black should make sure that after ♗c1-e3xc5
he does not remain without effective counterplay, with his own bad
bishop on e7. So the initial question is: which plan does the second
player follow to get counterplay? The following sample game by the
leading Armenian GM Vladimir Akopian offers a few good
suggestions: 6…a5 7.♘ge2 ♗e7 8.0-0 0-0 9.♘g3 ♘e8 In this
central structure the exchange of the dark-squared bishops is nearly
always a good idea: 10.♗e3 ♗g5 11.♕d2 ♗xe3 12.♕xe3 ♘f6
Black has equalized, and it is clearly White who must relieve his
position by trying to trade off his bad bishop: 13.♗c2 ♗d7 14.h3
(14.b3 ♘g4 15.♕d2 ♕h4! (the exchange on the dark squares
makes itself felt) 16.h3 ♘f6 17.a3 ♕f4 18.♕e2 h5 19.b4 axb4

6…a5 7.♗e3
In view of Black’s rapid development, White also has to hurry.
7.♘ge2 is somewhat too slow and inharmonious: 7…♗e7 8.♘g3
(8.♗e3 transposes to the variation 8.♘ge2 in the main game) 8…h5
9.♗e3 g6 10.♗e2 h4 11.♘f1 ♘h5 12.g3 (12.♕d2?! ♘f4!) 12…♗g5
and Black assumes the initiative.
7…♗e7 8.♕d2
The standard build-up. If Black wants to exchange on the dark
squares, he now has to opt for …h7-h6, which of course creates a
target of attack on the kingside.
8.♘ge2 ♘fd7 9.♕d2 h6 10.g3 ♗g5 11.f4 ♗f6!N (11…exf4 12.gxf4
♗h4+ 13.♘g3 ; 11…♗e7 12.♗g2 c6?! 13.b3 , fighting for the c5-

square!) 12.♗g2 (12.f5?! ♗g5 ; 12.b3?? exf4–+ with the threat
13…♘xe4) 12…a4 13.0-0 ♘b6
8…h6
9.0-0-0
White prepares a pawn storm on the kingside. He can rightly assume
that Black will sooner or later castle kingside, after which the attack
target on h6 as well as the white space advantage can lead to a
dangerous attack. In particular, the deployment g2-g4 followed by
♘g1-e2-g3-f5 is promising.
But White can also try to exploit his space advantage by purely
positional 
means. 
With 
9.g3!? 
White 
develops 
his 
game
harmoniously and avoids compromising his own pawn formation.
After the minor weakening move …h7-h6, the lever …f7-f5 would
leave further weaknesses in its train and leave White in control of
the nice outpost at e4. But Black is preparing the exchange of the
dark-squared bishops: 9…♘fd7 (9…0-0 10.♘h3 N) 10.♘h3 (10.h4
loosens the pawn front on the right side. An attack with g3-g4, by
reason of the hanging h-pawn, lies in the distance, so that Black
now has enough time to find counterplay on the other side of the
board: 10…0-0 11.♘h3 a4 12.♘f2 ♘f6 13.♗g2 c6  with the idea …
♗d7, …♕a5 and …♖fc8) 10…0-0N 11.♘f2 ♗g5 12.♗xg5 (12.f4
♗f6 13.f5 ♗g5=) 12…♕xg5 13.♕xg5 hxg5 – White’s space

advantage here is practically meaningless, but he does have a good
lever by which he can keep a small initiative: 14.h4! gxh4 15.♖xh4
♘f6 16.♖h2 (16.♘b5 ♘a6) 16…g6  Still, Black has good chances
gradually to equalize.
9…♘fd7
The Croatian grandmaster does not think of castling right away, but
first prepares the exchange of the dark-squared bishops as well as a
possible counter-attack on the queenside. His flexible play on both
sides of the board – even where he has less space! – is an important
technique in the closed King’s Indian structure.
10.g3
White must also play in a flexible manner in case an immediate
attack does not materialize.
A) 10.h4!?N is an interesting suggestion by the computer for
improving the line. When one is at the board in such situations, it is
not easy to decide whether one should seize the opportunity to
attack. Since White otherwise gets good chances of attack without
concessions, he should at least have to prove his compensation after
10…♗xh4 11.♔b1 ♗e7∞;
B) After 10.g4?!N, 10…♘f8! followed by …♘g6 underscores the
weakness of the squares h4 and, above all, f4.
10…a4 11.♔b1

This is a typical critical position in the Sämisch System. White is
ready to attack, but he cannot really do so until Black castles. So he
first improves his position and furthers his development. Maneuvers
like ♘g1-e2-c1-d3, among others, are possible, by which White can
contest the c5-square and, later, the c-file. In principle, Black should
prepare his queenside counterplay in a way that is as non-committal
as possible, and only then proceed to castle; and if this counterplay
is stopped, then Black resorts to the assault against the white king
down the c-file. If Black’s counterplay goes well, White’s kingside
attack does not get very far.
11…0-0
It is unclear whether immediate castling or …c7-c6 first is preferable.
11…c6 is a good alternative.
analysis diagram
To illustrate the dangers for both kings, here are some sample
variations that demonstrate the typical attacking motifs:
A) 12.g4N exploits the fact that after …c7-c6 the d6-pawn
becomes vulnerable. To be sure, this pawn can often be sacrificed
for the sake of opening the queenside; e.g. 12…♗g5 13.♗xg5 hxg5
14.dxc6?! bxc6 15.♕xd6 ♕b6 ;

B) 12.f4 on the other hand does nothing against Black’s expansion
on the left-hand side of the board. 12…♕a5 13.♘f3 a3!N 14.b3 ♗f6
15.♕c2 ♘a6 ;
C) 12.h4N ♕a5 13.g4 ♘b6 14.♘h3 ♗d7 15.♘f2
analysis diagram
This would be a typical continuation after 11…c6. On the one hand,
Black’s game does not progress without his opponent’s kingside
attack, and on the other, castling kingside is very dangerous. 15…0-
0!∞
C1) 16.♗xh6? fortunately does not work, since Black too has
brought sufficient force to bear against a kingside attack: 16…♘b3!
(16…gxh6? 17.♕xh6 ♖fb8 18.g5 ♗f8 19.♕h5 ♗g7 20.g6 fxg6
21.♕xg6 ♖f8 22.♖g1 ♖f7 23.h5+–) 17.♕e3 ♘d4 ;
C2) 16.♖e1 is somewhat more circumspect, but it permits 16…
♘b3! 17.♕d1! (17.axb3? axb3 18.♔c1 ♕a1+ 19.♘b1 ♘a4!
20.dxc6 bxc6 21.♘d1 d5! ) 17…♘d4 (17…♘c5 18.♕d2=) 18.a3!
♘b3 19.♗d3 (19.♘xa4) 19…cxd5 20.♘xd5 ♘xd5 21.exd5 b5
22.cxb5 ♗xb5 ;
C3) After 16.g5 h5∞ both sides have good practical chances.
Back to the game.

12.h4
White launches his pawn storm.
12.♘h3N is less committal. The knight can cover the important g4-
square from f2; e.g. 12…c6 13.♘f2 ♕a5 14.h4∞.
12…c6 13.f4?!
So White’s kingside attack does not get going; with the help of the
hole at g4 Black can constrain the white attack. This is the most
frequent scenario when the players castle on opposite wings and
launch attacks on the king, which we encountered also with 6.♗f4 in
the Antoshin Variation. In the heat of battle it is overlooked that the
opponent can hold up his own pawn storm in order later on to
conduct his attack to success.
Correct was 13.g4!; e.g. 13…♖e8N 14.g5 h5 15.♘ge2 ♕a5 16.♘g3
g6 17.♘ge2 ♘b6 18.♘c1  ♗d7 19.a3 ♖ec8 20.♕c2 ♗e8 .
13…♕a5 14.♘f3 a3
14…♖e8!? is an alternative worth considering.
15.b3

15…♘f6!
This is the right idea. Black takes the g4-square under his control,
after which the white pawn storm comes to a halt. His control of the
dark squares promises Black the better chances. In the further
course of the game he was able to press his advantage home after
inaccuracies on both sides:

Conclusion
With the Sämisch setup – an early d4-d5, e2-e4 and f2-f3 – White
consolidates his space advantage. After castling queenside,
especially, he can try for a kingside attack. But Black has counter-

chances – on the queenside, and by the threatened exchange of the
dark-squared bishops with …h7-h6 and …♗e7-g5.
Section 5: The build-up with e2-e3
The somewhat restrained development with e2-e3 before developing
White’s queen’s bishop is rarely encountered. But it is also useful
here to know a clear development scheme. We develop with …c7-c6,
…♖e8 and …♗f8 to compel White, by the threat …e5-e4, to react in
the center.
Game 35
Richard Biolek 2419
Pawel Jaracz 2502
Czechia tt 2013/14
1.c4
The standard line in the e3-system of the Old Indian would be: 1.d4
d6 2.c4 e5 3.♘f3 ♘d7 4.♘c3 ♘gf6 5.e3
1…♘f6
This move could lead us out of the d6-repertoire.
Our repertoire line is 1…d6 2.♘c3 e5 3.e3 ♗e7 4.♘f3 ♘f6.
2.♘c3 e5 3.e3 ♗e7 4.♘f3 d6 5.d4 ♘bd7
White’s deployment is quite restrained, but it makes sense. The first
player reinforces the neuralgic d4-square, which, starting with …e7-

e5, represents a focus of Black’s counter-pressure. In contrast to the
system with ♗g5, here the white queen’s bishop remains inside the
pawn chain. This has the advantage that Black cannot so easily
simplify the game by trading off the dark-squared bishops. The
disadvantage, of course, is that for the time being the white queen’s
bishop remains somewhat passive. On the other hand, White can set
up a solid and harmonious game with ♗d3(e2), ♕c2, 0-0 and, later,
b2-b3 followed by ♗b2. We can now set up our formation with …0-
0, …c7-c6, …♖e8 and …♗f8. This is a safe plan, since the danger of
the cross-lever c4-c5 is not great in view of White’s passive play.
6.♗d3
Here the bishop is more active than on e2; plus, White must control
the e4-square.
6.♗e2 is a popular alternative – the white king’s bishop is not
exposed to the …e5-e4-pawn lever: 6…0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.♕c2 ♖e8
9.♖d1 ♗f8

16.♕b3 ♗g4 ;
B) 10.e4 (quite rare, and inconsistent, but engines even say it’s
the best move!) 10…♕c7  with typical play analogous to the
classical main variation. Black does not profit from White’s loss of
tempo with e2-e3-e4; he must therefore accept no noticeable
disadvantages in his own position.
6…0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.h3 ♖e8 9.♕c2
9…♗f8
The idea of this development scheme is, with …♕e7, to force a
reaction in the center.
9…♕c7N, followed by 10.b3 ♘f8 11.♗b2 ♘g6 12.♖ad1 ♗f8, is
certainly possible, but White can take advantage of the available e4-
square to trade off the f6-knight, after which the knight on g6 and
the bishop at f8 are inharmoniously placed: 13.♘e4! ♘xe4 14.♗xe4
White has a clear advantage, as the black pieces are poorly
coordinated.
Our typical Old Indian counterplay with …a7-a6 and …b7-b5 does
not work well here because the first player can utilize the central e4-
square as an active outpost for his pieces: 9…a6 10.b3 b5?! 11.dxe5
dxe5 12.♘e4
10.b3

The logical continuation of White’s play. The queen’s bishop can be
developed at either b2 or a3.
After 10.b4N White also plays 10…♕e7! 11.♘d2 (11.♗e2 ♘b6
12.♖b1 exd4 13.♘xd4 g6 14.♕b3 ♗g7 15.♖d1 a5 16.a3 d5 17.c5
♘bd7 ) 11…g6 12.b5 ♗g7 . The attack against the c6-pawn does
not achieve very much, whereas Black has the d4-square in his
sights.
10…♕e7
This forces White into a decision regarding e4!
11.♘d2
The knight retreat eases Black’s game. There is no longer pressure
on e5, and White can no longer answer the always present …exd4
with ♘xd4.
A) 11.♗e2N is of course illogical – the bishop could go to e2 in
one move. Black can now go over to counterplay with …a7-a6 and …
b7-b5, since ♘c3-e4 is not dangerous here; e.g. 11…g6 12.♗a3 a6
13.dxe5 (13.♖fd1 e4! 14.♘d2 b5! ) 13…♘xe5 14.♘xe5 ♕xe5
15.♖ad1 ♕g5!  16.♔h1 ♕h6 17.♔h2 (17.♗xd6 ♗xd6 18.♖xd6
♗xh3 19.gxh3? ♕xh3+ 20.♔g1 ♖e5!–+) 17…♗f5 18.♕c1 ♖ad8
19.♖d4 ♘e4 20.♘xe4 ♗xe4=;
B) After 11.e4N exd4 12.♘xd4 g6 13.♗f4 ♘c5 14.♕d2 ♕c7  a
relatively comfortable version of the Boleslavsky Wall has been

reached.
11…g6
The bishop will go to g7 to be directed at the d4-pawn, which is
again vulnerable.
11…a6 12.♗a3 b5?! is bad, however, because of 13.♘de4 .
12.♗a3 ♕d8
The Polish grandmaster removes his queen from the unpleasant X-
ray vision of the bishop.
12…♗g7?! is also conceivable. On the basis of the following
variation we see in principle a desirable, and typical, expansion on
the kingside, although Black is not yet well enough prepared for this:
13.♘de4 ♘xe4 14.♘xe4 c5 15.dxc5 dxc5 16.♖ad1  f5 17.♘c3 e4
18.♗e2 b6 19.♘d5 ♕e5 20.♖d2 ♗b7 21.♖fd1 The black pawn
structure is in good order, but White is far ahead in development. His
control of the d-file carries weight and his pieces are more actively
placed. 21…♖ad8 22.b4!  (22.♘xb6 axb6 23.♖xd7 ♖xd7 24.♖xd7
♗c6 25.♖d2! f4 26.♗b2! )
13.♖ad1 exd4 14.exd4 d5
After the immediate central advance White gets a small lead in
development, but Black should equalize before long.
15.♗c1 ♗g7 16.♘f3 ♘f8 17.♖fe1 ♖xe1+ 18.♖xe1  ♘e6
At this point the international master from Czechia apparently
accepted his opponent’s offer of a draw.
Black’s position is sound and gives no reason to doubt that he has
successfully completed the development of his queenside. Here is a
sample variation: 19.♗e3 ♕d6 20.♕d2 ♗d7 21.♘e5 dxc4 22.♗xc4
(22.bxc4 ♖d8) 22…♖d8 23.♗f4 ♕b4 24.♘d3 ♕f8=
Conclusion
Against the somewhat restrained setup with e2-e3, Black develops
with …c7-c6, …♖e8 and …♗f8. Due to the threat …e5-e4, if
necessary supported by …♕e7, White is pushed to a reaction in the
center. After the withdrawal of the f3-knight the exchange …e5xd4,
e3xd4 creates a pawn on d4 that is in need of protection, which,
among other measures, can be put under pressure by the fianchetto
of the king’s bishop.

5.♘f3 ♘c6 6.e4 e5
5.e4 e5 6.♘f3 exd4 7.♘xd4 ♗e7

In this chapter we analyze variations after 1.d4 d6 that are not part
of the Old Indian Defense.
The first variation, 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5, is not especially good for White,
although it is often adopted by less experienced players. It is
certainly very tempting to deprive one’s opponent of the right to
castle after 3…dxe5 4.♕xd8+ ♔xd8.
If White does not play c2-c4, our choice of setup depends on White’s
scheme of development. In general, we play the typical …♘bd7, …
e7-e5 and …♗e7. But if White controls the e5-square, as in the
variations 2.♗f4 and 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.♗f4, as well as 3.b3 and ♗b2,
the advance …e7-e5 must first be prepared, or else we modify our
build-up. In so doing we try to exploit the respective disadvantages
of the various white setups.
2.e4 would transpose to the systems after 1.e4 d6 2.d4, discussed in
the first three chapters.
A few variations can also be reached by transposition from the
English or the flank openings, if White, after e.g. 1.♘f3, 1.c4 or
even 1.b3, follows up with a later d2-d4.
Game 36
Fy Antenaina Rakotomaharo 2450
Tigran Gharamian 2649
Paris 2015
1.d4 d6 2.c4
After 2.g3 ♘f6 3.♗g2 ♘bd7 we will almost always arrive at familiar
variations, e.g.
A) 4.e4 e5 with formations analogous to the side variations
against the Antoshin: 5.♘f3 (5.c3 ♗e7) 5…♗e7;
B) 4.♘f3 e5 5.c4 ♗e7 6.♘c3, transposing to the Old Indian.
2…e5

Black gets a comfortable central counter-thrust, which is why the
main move 2.♘f3 is significantly more popular than 2.c4.
With 2…♘f6 too Black remains within the d6-repertoire. Even with
original play White cannot uncover any disadvantages to 2…♘f6;
e.g. 3.♘c3 ♘bd7 (3…e5 is quite playable, but is less comfortable
here than on the second move; we therefore refrain from it for the
sake of a more accurate treatment) 4.f4 e5=. But there is no reason
to avoid going into a queenless middlegame – quite the contrary!
3.dxe5
White cannot resist temptation and trades queens. Not a good
decision!
A) 3.♘f3 ♘d7 transposes to the Old Indian, which we analyzed in
the previous chapter;
B) After 3.♘c3 ♘d7 too the game will almost inevitably go into
the Old Indian Defense:
B1) 4.g3 Now, with 4…♘gf6 we can go into the Old Indian by
transposition, or with 4…exd4!? 5.♕xd4 ♘gf6 try to reveal the
disadvantages of the early development of the white queen; e.g.
6.♗g2 ♗e7 7.♘f3 0-0 8.0-0 ♖e8 9.b3 (9.♗f4 ♘c5=) 9…♘c5
10.♗b2 c6  with a typical Boleslavsky Wall, which we dealt with in
the previous chapter;
B2) 4.♘f3 ♘gf6 5.e3;
B3) 4.d5; and

B4) 4.e3 ♘gf6 are all looked at in the chapter on the Old Indian.
C) For 3.d5 see Chapter 4, Old Indian, Section 3: ‘Early d4-d5’.
3…dxe5 4.♕xd8+ ♔xd8
At first glance one might assume that Black has to cope with
problems because of his king position. This appearance, however, is
deceptive; on closer inspection it is White who has to take the
trouble to develop his forces harmoniously. The reason is the
unfortunately placed pawn on c4. On the one hand, it stands in the
way of the white pieces – both the king’s bishop and a knight would
be brilliant on c4. Plus, the pawn is soon attacked by …♗e6 and the
natural protection with b2-b3 gives Black the lever …a7-a5-a4. In
contrast, the second player can develop comfortably with …c7-c6, …
♔c7, …♗e6 and, after b2-b3, then …a7-a5 followed by …♘b8-d7-
a6-c5 and a later …a5-a4. The control of the c5-square should not
be given up. But even with our optimism we of course should not
forget that White still has two rooks and four minor pieces. That is to
say: every opportunity to open the position must be considered well
in advance!
5.♘f3
5.♘c3 ♗e6, after 6.e3 as well as after 6.b3 and 6.♘f3 will probably
lead to the main game by transposition.
5…f6

The pawn block f6/e5 not only hems in the knight, but also cuts
down nearly all of the bishop’s prospects. Should the first player
fianchetto the king’s bishop, it would bite on granite on the long
diagonal after …c7-c6. Then again, if he moves the king’s pawn, this
will stand in the way of the bishop. Not a simple situation for White!
6.♘c3
6.♖g1, with the idea g2-g4-g5, also leaves Black with the initiative
after 6…♗e6.
6…c6
The king belongs on c7.
6…♗e6 is also good.
7.♖g1
The lever g2-g4, which is made possible by the protecting move …
f7-f6, must be painstakingly prepared, and at the same time yields
little.
A) With 7.e4 White creates a pawn structure that will be
disadvantageous for him over the long term, a formation
characteristic of the King’s Indian Exchange Variation. In that line
White does have a marked initiative, but here that is out of the
question. Black therefore has good chances as long as he controls
c5; e.g. 7…♗e6 8.♗e3 ♘d7 9.0-0-0 ♔c7 10.♘e1 ♘h6!? (10…g6

11.g3 ♗h6 12.f4 exf4 13.gxf4 ♘e5 14.♖d4=) 11.f3 (11.♗xh6?!
gxh6 12.♘c2 ♗c5 ) 11…♘f7=;
B) After 7.e3 play should continue in a similar way to the game
continuation.
7…♗e6 8.e3 ♘h6 9.♗d2 ♘d7 10.0-0-0 ♔c7
The French grandmaster has developed his pieces in model fashion.
The central position of his king is not a problem here, but an
opportunity. Black makes use of the fact that his rook is already
placed on a8 and would like to provoke the pawn move b2-b3 with
…♘h6-f7-d6, then open the queenside with …a7-a5-a4. Almost all of
his pieces are ready for action on that side of the board.
11.h3 ♘f7 12.g4 ♘d6 13.b3 a5
It is difficult to suggest good moves for the young FIDE Master from
Madagascar. White’s kingside play is for the moment innocuous,
while Black’s initiative on the queenside is growing move by move.
14.♘e1
The knight should intervene in the defense by going to c2 or d3.
If 14.♘a4?! ♘e4 ; 14.♗e1!? ♘c5 ; or 14.g5 a4 .
14…a4 15.♔b2
White should try for simplification.
A) 15.♘d3! encourages Black, in view of the threat c4-c5, to try
an energetic and not altogether risk-free attack if he wants to

continue to build up his advantage: 15…axb3 (15…b5!? 16.c5! axb3)
16.axb3 b5 17.c5 ♗xb3 18.cxd6+ ♗xd6 19.♖e1 ♘b6;
B) 15.♘xa4?! is answered with 15…♘xc4 .
15…♗e7?!
This natural move renounces the sharp queenside attack and thus
gives the opponent a chance to consolidate his position.
After 15…b5! the white queenside could hardly be defended; e.g.
16.cxb5 axb3 17.axb3 (17.bxc6 ♘c5! 18.axb3 ♗xb3 19.♖b1 ♘c4+
20.♗xc4 ♗xc4 ) 17…♘c5! .
16.♘d3 axb3 17.axb3 e4 18.♘f4 ♗f7 19.♗e2?!
Now the f4-knight gets chased away to h5. Better is 19.♘fe2 .
19…g5 20.♘h5
20…♗xh5?
After this unfavorable exchange Black’s initiative dries up. The
bishop was important for his queenside play.
With the logical 20…♘c5 21.♘g3 (21.♖a1 b5 ) 21…b5! the
grandmaster could deprive the white king of his protective pawn
front and attack down the a- and b-files.
21.gxh5 f5
The chances are now about even. In the ensuing play, Tigran
Gharamian manages to break through against his less experienced
opponent.

22.b4 ♘e5 23.♔b3 ♘df7 24.♘a4 ♖a7 25.♗c3 ♖ha8 26.♖a1= b6
27.♖gd1 ♗f6 28.♗b2 ≥ 28.♗d4! ♔b7∞ 28…h6 29.c5 b5 30.♘b6 ♖xa1

0-1
Conclusion
In the variation 1.d4 d6 2.c4 e5, the queen exchange after 3.dxe5
dxe5 4.♕xd8+ ♔xd8 is not to be feared. White’s slightly weak pawn
structure (after c2-c4) can have thoroughly negative consequences,
while the black king, after …c7-c6 and …♔c7, is securely placed.
This is probably why hardly any grandmaster plays this line with
white.
Game 37
Tuan Minkh Tran 2417
Francesco Rambaldi 2540
Khanty-Mansiysk Wch U20 2015
1.d4 d6 2.♗f4
This harmless way of developing the bishop, in the style of the
London System, has as its purpose combating the setup we aim for
with an early …e7-e5. We therefore make an exception and
fianchetto our king’s bishop! In this line, the delayed development of
our king’s knight plays an important role.
It is difficult to assign the move 2.♗g5 any independent
significance. After 2…♘d7 the game usually develops according to
well-known patterns: 3.♘c3 (for 3.♘f3 ♘gf6 see the next game,
Piankov-Zude) 3…♘gf6 4.e4 e5 and White hardly has anything
better than 5.♘f3, transposing into the 3.♗g5 variation in the next
game.

2…g6
As we have said, this is one of the few exceptions in our d6-
repertoire. Normally, we put the king’s bishop on e7. But here an
attractive long diagonal beckons, as well as the counter-stroke …e7-
e5, winning a tempo. The e7-square is reserved for the queen.
A) 2…♘d7 3.♘f3 g6 is also possible, most of the time
undoubtedly transposing to the game (after 3…♘gf6, on the other
hand, both the diagonal g7-e5 and the black queen’s bishop are
misplaced, so that neither an early …f7-f5 nor …♗c8-f5 can work;
naturally this way of playing is perfectly fine – Black can attack the
white center with, for example, …c7-c5, and activate the queen via
b6 or a5; but we prefer 2…g6);
B) After 2…♘f6, White, with 3.♘f3, could go into the 3.♗f4
variation in the following game, or continue with 3.h3!?, when we
also have difficulty reaching our standard setup with …♘db7 and …
e7-e5.
3.e3 ♗g7 4.♘f3 ♘d7 5.h3
The experienced London System player protects his queen’s bishop
the way he always does. An exchange with …♘h5 is no longer to be
feared. On the h2-g8 diagonal the bishop performs valuable services.
Should Black, for example, push his central pawn to e4 then White
can play c4-c5, attacking d6 and c7. Moreover, the bishop helps
defend White’s castled position.

On 5.♗c4, 5…e5 6.♗g5 ♘e7 is interesting. White’s bishops have
ventured too far and should beat a hasty retreat; e.g. 7.0-0 f6
8.♗h4 ♘f5 9.♗g3 e4 (9…c6 ) 10.♘fd2 ♘xg3 11.hxg3 f5 .
5…e5 6.♗h2
The bishop does not stand better at g3: 6.♗g3 exd4 (6…♘e7)
7.exd4 ♘e7 with the idea …♘e7-f5.
At this point we should note the following scheme of development.
Black, after …♕e7 and …f7-f5, can of course play his king’s knight
to f6. But there it blocks the bishop and has few prospects. If after
castling Black should then wish to use his king’s rook to support …
f5-f4, there would be only two places for the knight to go – h5 and
e8 – both of them rather unattractive. We prefer instead the build-up
with …♘g8-h6, where the knight is not standing in anyone’s way
and where it protects important squares – and later, e.g. after the
expansion …e5-e4, can participate in a kingside attack or be
redeployed with …♘f7.
6…♘h6
An important building block of Black’s formation!
6…♕e7 is also good. We use this modified move sequence to look
over the shoulder of the very knowledgeable and experienced Polish
GM Michal Krasenkow: 7.♗e2 and now:

A) 7…♘gf6 in the first place blocks the f-pawn and is therefore
less active. Black can, however, make up for this later on. This setup
is very solid, but we shall not look into it further. Here are just a few
suggestions in outline:
A1) 8.♘bd2?! e4! 9.♘g1 0-0 ;
A2) 8.♘c3 c6 9.0-0 0-0=;
A3) 8.c3 0-0 9.0-0 b6=, a scheme of development in the style of
the King’s Indian Attack (with colors reversed);
A4) 8.c4 ♘e4!= 9.0-0 0-0 10.♕c2 f5 11.♗d3 ♘ef6=
B) 7…♘h6!? 8.c4 f5 9.♘c3! c6 10.♕b3 0-0 (10…♘f7) 11.♕a3?!
(11.0-0 ♘f7=) 11…♘f7 (with 11…f4!N, White could have exploited
the unsafe position of the white king; e.g. 12.dxe5 fxe3 13.♕xd6
exf2+ 14.♔xf2 ♕d8 ) 12.dxe5 ♘fxe5 13.♖d1 ♘c5. This structure
resembles the Boleslavsky Wall, in which the gain of space with …f7-
f5 represents an improvement. Here, however, Black does not have
enough time to consolidate his position with …♗e6 and …a7-a5:
14.0-0  ♗e6 (14…a5) 15.♘xe5 dxe5 16.♘d5! cxd5 17.cxd5 ♖fc8
(17…b6) 18.dxe6 ♕xe6 19.b3 (19.♖c1 ) 19…♔h8  0-1 (53)
Bodiroga-Krasenkow, Rijeka 2010.
7.♗e2 0-0 8.0-0 ♕e7 9.c4 f5 10.♘c3 c6
Both sides have completed their intended setups. Actually, the
bishop posted on h2 should provide good insurance against possible

black kingside attacks. But the deployment of the knight to h6 gives
rise to some additional possibilities in comparison with the standard
development to f6. Among other possibilities, the knight helps with
the advance …g6-g5-g4. And a potential …♘h6-f5 (after …f5-f4) is
in the air. Objectively, the position may be level; in practical play,
however, White has to worry about his kingside. The obvious plan
for White here is to attack energetically on the queenside before
Black’s attack arrives.
11.b4
The Vietnamese international master decides on a typical queenside
advance. With b4-b5 the c6-square can be weakened and the
opening of the b-file prepared. The move, however, opens up still
further possibilities.
More circumspect was 11.♕c2 or 11.♖c1.
11…g5
The young Italian grandmaster prefers not to waste time, but he
runs into the treacherous cross-lever c4-c5, which caused us some
headaches earlier in the Old Indian.
A) 11…♘f7 was more prudent: 12.♖e1 (12.♕b3 ♘f6 13.c5
♗e6!; 12.♖c1) 12…e4 (12…a5 13.a3 ♖e8) 13.♘d2 ♘f6∞;
B) The energetic 11…f4!? is also possible; e.g. 12.exf4 exd4
13.♘a4 (13.♘xd4? ♕f6! ) 13…d3 14.♗xd3 ♗xa1 15.♕xa1 .
12.c5!
With this move White fights for the piece outpost at d4.
12…d5
After the opening of the center a black attack is no longer on the
cards: 12…dxc5 13.bxc5 ♔h8 (13…g4 14.hxg4 ♘xg4 15.♗g3 )
14.♖c1
13.♘xe5?!
This provides the second player with an interesting possibility of
attack.
A) After 13.♕b3 Black could grasp the initiative with 13…g4 ; e.g.
14.♘xe5 ♘xe5 15.dxe5 ♗xe5, when the protective h2-bishop gets
traded off;
B) Still better, however, is 13.♖c1; e.g. 13…g4 14.hxg4 ♘xg4
15.♗g3! f4 16.exf4 exf4 17.♗h4! .
13…♘xe5 14.♗xe5 ♗xe5 15.dxe5

Now, the simple recapture was perfectly fine, but Rambaldi puts his
opponent under pressure by means of the following attack.
15…f4!?
15…♕xe5=
16.♘xd5?
White cannot stop the attack by tactical means; he gets insufficient
compensation for the piece.
A) 16.e4 ♕xe5 , in contrast, was quite possible (16…dxe4?
17.♘xe4 ♕xe5 18.♗c4+ ♔h8 19.♖e1 );
B) Best here, though, was 16.exf4 gxf4 17.♕d4 ♕g5 , with a
very sharp position.
16…cxd5
Rambaldi plays the rest of the game very confidently.

Conclusion
Against 2.♗f4 we (as an exception) fianchetto our king’s bishop and
adopt the setup with …g7-g6, …♗g7, …♘d7, …e7-e5, …♕e7 and …

♘h6!. Black can get attacking chances even against a white kingside
that has been strengthened with the bishop at h2.
Game 38
Evgenij Piankov 2284
Erik Zude 2371
Hofbieber ch-GER 2014
1.d4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6
In this game we consider the development of the white queen’s
bishop to f4 and g5 when White has already played his knight to f3.
The immediate 2.♗f4 was the subject of the previous game.
3.c3
Evgenij Piankov, an experienced IM, supports his d-pawn and
subsequently trades his queen’s bishop on f6 for a knight. Then he
wants to play against Black’s bad king’s bishop, which after the
natural …e7-e5 is formally ‘bad’. We encounter this play against the
bad bishop in a similar form in the King’s Indian also, and in some
other typical pawn formations.
A) 3.♗f4 makes it more difficult for Black to achieve our standard
setup with …e7-e5. But the move also has its disadvantages. For
one, the bishop might be threatened with exchange by …♘h5; for
another the b2-pawn is temporarily left unprotected. 3…h6 4.h3

(4.e3 ♘h5! – we should effect this exchange without the weakening
…g7-g5 – let us not miss it!) 4…c6 (this flexible pawn move, among
others, enables a queen sortie to b6 or a5) 5.e3 ♕b6 This attack on
b2 causes a slight disharmony in White’s position. In contrast, Black
gets active development on the kingside with …♗f5, …♘bd7, …g7-
g5 and …h6-h5:
A1) 6.♕c1 ♗f5 7.♗e2 ♘bd7 8.0-0 g5 9.♗h2:
A11) 9…♖g8!?∞, with the idea …h6-h5 and …g5-g4;
A12) 9…♗g7= Black, despite the ‘expanded fianchetto’ (…h7-h6,
…g7-g5 and …♗g7), can castle kingside before long and later can
strive for …c6-c5 or …b7-b5; e.g. 10.a4 0-0 11.a5 ♕d8 12.♘bd2 b5
13.b4 ♖c8 .
A2) 6.b3 g5 Here, too, Black can try to open a file on the kingside
or simply develop the bishops to f5 and g7. Here are a few sample
variations:
A21) 7.♗g3 ♕a5+ 8.c3 ♗f5 9.♗d3 ♗e4 10.0-0 ♘bd7=;
A22) 7.♗h2 h5!? (7…♗f5 8.♗d3 h5!?∞) 8.c3= g4!? (8…♗h6!?;
8…♖g8!?)
B) 3.♗g5 As in the Antoshin Variation the development of the
bishop here exerts little pressure. It is not always easy to safeguard
this bishop against an unwanted (from White’s point of view)
exchange operation. 3…♘bd7 and now:
B1) 4.♘c3 e5:
B11) After 5.e4 ♗e7 we go into positions analogous to the side
variations against the Antoshin. We examined White’s setup with
♘bd2 and c2-c3 in the game Gedajlovic-Arizmendi Martinez. With
the knight on c3 play might go, for example: 6.♗c4 0-0 7.0-0 c6
8.a4 exd4 9.♕xd4 ♕c7 (with the idea …♘e5 or …♘c5 followed by
…♗e6 or …♘e6) with a position very familiar to us, in which the g5-
bishop is rather more the hunted than the hunter;
B12) 5.e3 c6 6.♗d3 ♗e7 7.0-0 0-0 is analogous to the side
variation against the Antoshin. White doesn’t threaten anything, and
later on e3-e4 might be played.
B2) 4.♘bd2 e5 5.c3 ♗e7 6.e4 This setup, too, we know from the
game Gedajlovic-Arizmendi Martinez, although there the white
queen’s bishop is still on c1. The ‘active’ ♗g5 is rather unfavorable;

e.g. 6…h6 7.♗h4?! (7.♗e3 ♘g4 ) 7…exd4 8.♗xf6 (8.cxd4 ♘xe4! )
8…♗xf6 9.cxd4 0-0 10.♗d3 c5  0-1 (34) Harikrishna-Grischuk,
Dubai 2014.
3…♘bd7 4.♗g5 e5 5.♘bd2
5…h6
I could hardly wait to exchange his bishop.
5…♗e7 is also good.
6.♗xf6
6.♗h4 ♗e7 7.e4?! (better is 7.dxe5 ♘xe5=) 7…exd4! would
transpose to the game Harikrishna-Grischuk (above) after 3.♗g5
♘bd7 4.♘bd2.
6…♕xf6 7.d5?!
White fixes the pawn chain d6/e5, confining the black king’s bishop.
But White cannot prevent Black from becoming active on the dark
squares, which he will do in one way or another. The most popular
route is, after …c7-c6, the maneuver …♗f8-e7-d8-b6(a5).
The first player should be satisfied with the fact that the black king’s
bishop is hemmed in by the pawn block b2/c3, which constricts the
bishop after, for example, the fianchetto …g7-g6 and …♗g7. After
7.e4 the game remains about even; e.g. 7…g6 8.♗c4 ♗g7 9.0-0 0-0
10.♖e1 ♕e7 11.♕c2 c6=, with a comfortable position for Black. Of

course, a later opening of the position, after which the bishop pair
becomes active, is not out of the question.
7.e3N looks significant. With the firm pawn wall and a harmonious
development, White has nothing to fear. But neither does Black!
7…♕d8
I didn’t spend a lot of time on this simple move – the queen belongs
on the queenside, on c7. The engines on the other hand prefer to
assign the strongest piece to the kingside, which I do not really
understand. We prefer instead to follow a solid and well-known
game plan.
Variations like 7…♗e7 8.e4 ♕g6  9.♗d3 0-0 10.0-0 ♘c5 11.♗c2
a5, 7…♕g6!?  8.♘h4 ♕h5, or 7…c6!?  8.♘e4 ♕g6 may be strong
tactically, but there is no reason to expose the queen to the cramped
conditions on the king’s wing, and to use a lot of time calculating
variations in which the queen could find herself in danger.
8.e4
The meddlesome pawn on d5 must be well protected.
8…♗e7
Standard development. The immediate 8…c6 was also good.
9.♕c2 c6
Here we can see clearly the problem with White’s layout. If he does
not want to leave his opponent with a pawn majority in the center

he must support the d5-pawn with c3-c4. This further devalues his
only remaining bishop and prevents the d2-knight from taking up a
potential, and good, outpost at c4. At the same time, the dark
squares are weakened, especially d4 – a long-term target for the
black king’s bishop!
10.c4 0-0 11.♗e2 a5
The usual safeguard for the piece outpost at c5.
12.0-0
Now the queen stands in the way of the transfer of the bishop to the
attractive a7-f2 diagonal. The following maneuver does take a lot of
time, but White cannot take advantage of this as he has no lever
available to open the position.
12…♕b6 13.♖fd1 ♘c5 14.♘b3
14…♗g4?!
This ‘active’ development of the queen’s bishop is no more than
gratuitous chatter. As with 4.♗g5, 14…♗g4 has more disadvantages
than advantages. The exchange of the bishops is possible if (!)
afterwards the dark squares on the a7-f2 diagonal thereby become
strong. But it was much simpler to hold on to the good queen’s
bishop and leave White to his bad king’s bishop:
A) 14…a4 ;

B) 14…♗d7  White cannot take tactical advantage of the
unprotected bishop on d7: 15.dxc6 bxc6 16.♘xe5 dxe5 17.♘xc5
♗xc5 18.♖xd7 ♗xf2+ 19.♔h1 ♖fd8
15.♘xc5
15.♖d2?! ♗d7!
15…♕xc5 16.♘e1
Piankov does not miss the chance to trade bishops. 16.♘d4 was also
possible: 16…♗xe2 17.♘xe2 ♖fc8!
16…♗xe2
16…♗d7 would of course be inconsistent, but could be considered:
17.dxc6 (17.♘d3 ♕d4 18.♘e1 ♕a7 ) 17…♗xc6
17.♕xe2 f5 18.♖ac1 fxe4
18…♗g5!? 19.♖c2 fxe4 20.♕xe4 ♖f4 21.♕g6 ♖af8 22.♘f3 ♗f6
19.♖c2
The position seems rather quiet, but positionally it is quite double-
edged! Should White prove able to force the e7-bishop into passivity
over the long term, and at the same time activate the knight, he
would clearly have the advantage. Fortunately, however, it is the
other way round: the bishop is strong and the knight is weak!
19…♗d8!
In a few moves the bishop will get to d4, where it will have an
impact. In the ensuing play I was able first to win the weak d5-
pawn, and later on the game.

Conclusion
The exchange of the white queen’s bishop for the knight on f6,
followed by the closing of the center, creates more problems for
White than for Black. Important in this formation is the maneuver …
♗e7-d8-b6!
Game 39
Shazuli Syed Anwar 2305
Saidali Iuldachev 2537
Dhaka 2005
1.d4 ♘f6
1…d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 is our repertoire line.
2.♘f3 d6 3.b3

This move, too, forces us to do some re-thinking. An early …e7-e5 is
not easy to achieve. Of course, in this position we could fianchetto
the king’s bishop, but this does nothing to uncover the
disadvantages of the white queenside fianchetto.
3…♗g4
With the pin of the f3-knight we want to get in an early …e7-e5.
4.e3
White forgoes putting the question to the bishop.
With 4.h3N ♗h5 (4…♗xf3 5.exf3 d5= is also playable) 5.g4 ♗g6
6.♘h4 White accepts a massive weakening of his kingside to trade
off Black’s queen’s bishop. After the ensuing 6…d5!? (6…♗e4!? 7.f3
♗g6) it becomes clear, however, that the first player has little
chance to develop an initiative on the queenside. The little move b2-
b3 leaves weaknesses in its train and blocks the queen from coming
to b3 (after c2-c4). Black can then turn his attention to the weak
white kingside. Here are a few sample variations: 7.♘xg6 hxg6
8.♗g2 e6 9.0-0 (9.c4 ♘c6!?) 9…♘c6!

analysis diagram
It has proved worthwhile to postpone the somewhat passive …♘bd7
so that now the path of the queen has been made clear. Rapid
development with …♕d6 and …0-0-0 is played to prepare Black’s
attack on the kingside. Black plans …♘e4 followed by …f7-f5.
A) 10.c4 ♘e4! ;
B) 10.♗g5 ♕d7 11.c4 ♘e4 ;
C) 10.♗a3? ♗xa3 11.♘xa3 ♘xg4! 12.hxg4 ♕d6 ;
D) 10.c3 ♘e4 11.♕d3 ♗d6  12.♕b5? (≥ 12.♘d2 f5) 12…♕h4
13.♕xb7 ♔d7 14.♕a6 f5 15.gxf5 gxf5
4…♘bd7 5.♗b2
The Indian grandmaster lets Black play …e7-e5 without any
difficulties, after which Black’s further development is unproblematic.
A) 5.♗e2 c6 6.0-0 e5 7.♗b2 e4 8.♘fd2 ♗xe2 9.♕xe2 d5 10.c4
is similar to the game continuation;
B) If at this point White plays h2-h3, Black’s setup from the 4.h3
variation unfortunately no longer works, as the queen’s knight
already stands on d7: 5.h3 ♗h5 6.♗b2 c6 followed by …e7-e6 and
…♗e7 is a flexible setup – one might say an ‘Old Indian with an
active queen’s bishop’ – and quite playable. After 7.g4 ♗g6 8.♘h4
e6 9.♘xg6 hxg6 10.♘d2= the first player does have the bishop pair,
but with the fianchetto setup on the queenside he cannot quickly

take the initiative there. Black can continue with, for example, …
♗e7, …g6-g5, …♘d7-f8-g6.
5…e5 6.♗e2
6.h3 ♗h5 transposes to the variation 5.h3.
The pressure on e5 now forces Black into a reaction. It is possible,
and solid, to bring about the pawn formation from the Antoshin
Variation with 6…exd4. But in view of the bishop development to b2,
the transition to a French structure with colors reversed is especially
promising.
6…e4
White’s queen’s bishop has already spent two tempi, but is
nevertheless ineffective on b2. And it is not protecting the e3-pawn,
which would support f2-f3, attacking the black center.
6…exd4 7.♕xd4 c6 8.c4 ♗e7
7.♘fd2 ♗xe2
This exchange, too, favors the second player in this pawn formation.
8.♕xe2 d5 9.c4
The queen sortie 9.♕b5?! causes more disharmony in White’s camp
than in Black’s! 9…♕b8 with the idea …c7-c6 and …♗f8-d6.
9…c6 10.cxd5 cxd5 11.0-0
With 11.♕b5 ♕b8 12.♗a3?! it is true that White can trade off the
bad bishop. But Black’s space advantage and the unharmonious
placement of the white knight guarantee Black a slight advantage:

12…a6 13.♕a5 b6! 14.♕c3 (14.♕a4? b5 15.♕a5 b4 16.♗b2 ♗d6
) 14…♗xa3 15.♘xa3 ♕d6 16.♕b2 0-0
The French structure with colors reversed opens up good prospects
for the second player. His bad bishop has already been exchanged,
and he can both get attacking chances on the kingside and conduct
a positional struggle for the c-file. Furthermore, there is the
possibility of playing against the white queen’s bishop, e.g. a pure
minor piece ending with a black knight against the white queen’s
bishop would be favorable for the second player.
11…♗b4
In the upcoming play, Syed Anwar, if he is to effect further
simplification, must cope with his grandmaster opponent’s threat to
exchange his bishop for a knight.
12.♗a3
12.a3 ♗a5 13.♘c3 0-0  was simpler.
12…a5
The bishop exchange is now unattractive, since Black could now
exert pressure on the half-open a-file.
13.f3?!
This standard lever, without the queen’s bishop’s support of the
important e3-pawn, is disadvantageous. In this structure the bishop
belongs on d2: ‘bad bishops protect good pawns!’
13…exf3

The backward e3-pawn on the half-open e-file is now weak.
14.♕xf3?!
14.♘xf3 was somewhat better. But after 14…♕e7 15.♗b2! 0-0
16.a3 ♗d6 17.♘c3 ♖fe8  Black would have a long-term advantage
at his command.
14…0-0
The game ends with a rapid collapse of the white position. But it is
already difficult for White to complete his development without
accident.
15.♗xb4 axb4 16.e4? ♕b6
0-1
Conclusion
After the fianchetto of the white queen’s bishop, the advance …e7-
e5-e4, transitioning into a French structure with colors reversed,
offers the second player good prospects.
Game 40
Surya Shekhar Ganguly 2615
Harika Dronavalli 2505
Doha 2014
1.d4
In the last game of this chapter we consider the development ♘c3
without a prior c2-c4.
1…♘f6
1…d6 is our repertoire continuation, after which 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.♘c3
leads to the main game.
2.♘f3 d6 3.♘c3

This is a tricky line against our repertoire. White allows the transition
to the Philidor Defense, but not to the Antoshin Variation!
3…♗f5
The bishop move again poses a problem for White. Having blocked
the c-pawn, he will not get a space advantage in the center without
the double-step of the e-pawn.
With the incautious 3…♘bd7 4.e4 e5 we arrive at the Hanham
Variation of the Philidor Defense, which does belong to our
repertoire. It is true that even in that line we could, with …exd4,
arrive at the center formation that we prefer, as, for example, in the
game Fedorchuk-Kunin, which is cited in Game 7, in the variation
10.♗b3. But the analysis of these lines would exceed the limits of
our little d6-repertoire.
4.♘h4
White forces the bishop to retreat, and then he can play e2-e4. But
the knight must later go back to f3.
After 4.e3, Black permits the exchange of his queen’s bishop for the
white king’s bishop, inasmuch as the first player, with 3.♘c3, has
blocked the c-pawn and therefore cannot get an initiative on the
queenside at all quickly:
A) 4…h6 5.♗d3! ♗xd3 6.♕xd3  c6 7.e4 e6 8.d5!?;
B) 4…♘bd7 5.♘h4 ♗g6 6.♘xg6 hxg6 7.e4 ;
C) 4…e6! and now:

C1) 5.♘h4 ♗g6 6.♗e2 (6.♘xg6 hxg6 7.e4 d5) 6…d5 7.0-0
♘bd7=;
C2) 5.♗d3 d5 (5…♗xd3 6.♕xd3 c6 ) 6.0-0 c6=
4…♗d7
In the balance of knight and bishop moves back and forth, Black
does win a tempo, but the development of the bishop to d7 must
still be given meaning. In many of the following variations the bishop
is rather in the way!
After 4…♗g4 5.h3 ♗h5 6.g4 ♗g6 7.♗g2 c6 8.♘xg6 hxg6 9.e4 e5
10.♗e3 White has the advantage. His weaknesses on the kingside
are difficult to exploit.
5.e4
After 5.♘f3 Black seeks with 5…♘c6 to play …e7-e5. White can
anticipate it or simply allow it.
analysis diagram
A) 6.d5 ♘e5 7.♘xe5 (7.e4 ♘xf3+ 8.♕xf3 g6 …♗g7, …0-0
followed by an early …c7-c6) 7…dxe5 The doubled pawn will be
resolved comfortably with the later …e7-e6. But it is also possible,
after …c7-c6, dxc6 and …♗xc6, to remain with the doubled pawn in
the center over the long term – the doublet controls many important
squares: 8.♕d3 c6 (8…e6 9.dxe6 ♗xe6 10.♕b5+∞) 9.dxc6 (9.e4
e6 10.d6 ♗c8) 9…♗xc6 10.e4 e6=;

dxe5 12.d6 ♗e6 13.dxe7 ♕xe7 is playable, but in view of White’s
bishop pair Black would be taking a long-term positional risk;
B2) After 7…exd4 Black strives for a position in the spirit of the
Antoshin Variation. It is true that he has played …♘c6 somewhat
prematurely, but the extra move …♗c8-d7 is entirely useful and
promises him even chances; e.g. 8.♘xd4 ♗e7 9.0-0 (9.♘f5 0-0
10.0-0 ♖e8 transposes) 9…0-0 10.♘f5 ♖e8 (10…♗xf5 11.exf5 )

5…e5 6.♘f3 ♘c6
As long as the bishop is not yet on e7 the d4-d5 push is rather
counterproductive, as Black has the maneuver …♘c6-e7-g6 at his
disposal.
6…exd4 7.♘xd4 ♗e7 is the Antoshin Variation with the extra move
…♗c8-d7. Black has good chances for equality:
A) 8.♗e2 ♘c6 transposes to the variation 5.♘f3 ♘c6 6.e4
above;
B) 8.g3 0-0 9.♗g2 ♘c6 10.0-0 ♖e8 11.♘f5 ♗f8=
7.h3
Anand’s second, the co-winner of the 2016 Bangkok Open, offers his
opponent a transition to a setup in which the extra move …♗c8-d7
is shown to be disadvantageous in comparison with the Antoshin
Variation. Very clever!
7.d5 here is harmless on account of 7…♘e7! followed by …♘g6, …
♗e7, …0-0 and a later …c7-c6.
7…exd4 8.♘xd4

8…♗e7?!
With 8 …♘xe4! Black would have revealed the advantages of the
developing move …♗d7. The second player can quickly castle
queenside. After the forced sequence 9.♘xe4 ♕e7 it is White who
has problems to solve:
A) 10.♘b5?! ♕xe4+ 11.♗e2 0-0-0 12.0-0 a6 ;
B) 10.f3? d5 11.♘b5 dxe4 12.♘xc7+ ♔d8 13.♘xa8 (½-½ (26)
Suhl-Möhring, Berlin 1997) 13…♕h4+!–+ 14.♔e2 (14.♔d2 e3+)
14…exf3+ 15.gxf3 ♗c5;
C) 10.♗d3 ♘xd4 11.0-0 ♘e6 12.♖e1 (12.f4 d5 13.♘g5 ♕c5+
14.♔h1 ♘xg5 15.fxg5 ♗e6 ) 12…0-0-0, when White has to show
he has compensation for the missing pawn.
9.g4!
The grandmaster shows very skillfully the disadvantages of the extra
tempo …♗d7 in the Antoshin Variation. In that line, after 6.h3 0-0
7.g4 we would have the typical counter-thrust in the center, 7…d5!.
See the 6.h3 variation in Game 12, Van Osch-Pruijssers. Here,
however, the bishop is in the way, and the move …♘c6 is less useful
than castling.
A) 9.♘f5 yields little, as after 9…0-0 10.♘xe7+?! ♕xe7 the e4-
pawn would be weak;
B) 9.♗e3 leads, after 9…0-0 and …♖e8, to a typical Antoshin
position.

9…♘xd4
Dronavalli does not care to allow the knight into f5, but this helps
her opponent develop.
The alternative 9…0-0, too, did not assure Black a carefree game.
With 10.g5 the knight exchange on d4 is forced, when White has the
advantage thanks to his quick development and very good control of
the center; e.g. 10…♘xd4 11.♕xd4 ♘e8 (11…♘h5? 12.♗e2 )
12.h4 c6 13.♗e3  f5 14.0-0-0! fxe4 15.♘xe4 (15.♗c4+ ♔h8
16.♘xe4 d5 17.♗e2 ♗f5 18.♘g3 ♗e6 19.♕e5 ) 15…d5 16.c4
(16.♘c5 ♗xc5 17.♕xc5 ♗g4=) 16…♘c7 17.cxd5 cxd5 18.♘c3
♗f5! 19.♗h3 b6 20.♗xf5 ♖xf5 .
9…h6!?N is also insufficient to equalize: 10.♘f5 0-0 11.♗g2 ♖e8
12.0-0 ♗f8
10.♕xd4
10…0-0
The disadvantages of the early centralization of the white queen are
not a factor, and its advantages are all the more striking. Black is
passively placed and will have a lot of trouble freeing herself.
10…h6N 11.♗f4 ♗c6 12.0-0-0 ♘d7 13.♔b1 0-0∞
11.g5 ♘e8 12.h4
The second player finds herself in an unfavorable version of the
Antoshin Variation. The black pieces are somewhat too passive for

the typical queenside counterplay.
12…c5
12…c6 13.♗e3 f5 transposes to the variation with 9…0-0.
13.♕d3 ♗c6 14.♘d5 ♘c7 15.♗f4 ♖e8
The position reminds us very much of the main variation in the
system with 6.♗f4 in the Antoshin Variation. See also Game 11,
Pötsch-Zude. But here, White is already very active.
15…♘xd5 16.exd5 ♗d7
16.0-0-0 ♗xd5?
This mistake puts Black on the verge of defeat, as White’s attack
develops unchecked. The c7-knight is useful neither to the defense
nor for a counter-attack.
After 16…♘xd5 17.exd5 ♗d7 Black’s disadvantage would be small.
The d7-bishop operates on both sides of the board and on f5 should
help neutralize White’s attack.
17.exd5  b5 18.♕g3 ♗f8 19.h5+–
A line opening on the kingside can no longer be held back. White’s
attack pushes through.
19…c4 20.♗h3 b4 21.♗f5 ♖b8 22.g6 ♕f6 23.gxf7+ ♕xf7 24.♗g6! ♕d7

Conclusion
The 3.♘c3 variation requires some attention to the move
sequences. With 3…♗f5, Black develops the bishop actively. If
White, with 4.♘h4 ♗d7 5.e4, then goes into the positions of the
Antoshin Variation, Black must see to it that the advantages of the
extra move …♗c8-d7 take effect.

1.c4 e5 2.♘c3 d6 3.g3 ♗e7 4.♗g2 f5
In this chapter we analyze 1.c4, the English Opening. After 1…e5
and the inevitable …d7-d6 followed by …♗e7, we reach a pawn
formation that we are very familiar with – with the difference that at
first White exerts no pressure in the center and so we don’t need …
♘bd7 and the …e7-e5 push. The first player usually develops slowly
with g2-g3 and ♗g2, so that with the early …f7-f5 we can gain
space on the kingside. An important element of our build-up against
the English Opening is the fact that we reserve the development of
our queen’s knight; before …♘bd7 we often play …c7-c6 and …
♗e6, with a very harmonious development. This enables Black to
control the central d5-square, and is sometimes followed by …d6-d5
if we can maintain the large center. Even if the differences from the
Old Indian are of course significant, we will have our most-familiar
build-up …e7-e5, …♗e7, …c7-c6 and …♘bd7 – here augmented
with…f7-f5 and …♗e6, when some recurring themes make it very
easy for us to find good plans in the middlegame. Should White
attack the e5-pawn early with d2-d4, we go over to the Old Indian
Defense with …♘bd7, even if in some positions the push …e5-e4
promises Black good play. Of course, after 1.c4 the principled 1…d7-
d6 – doing justice to the title of this book – is very playable. (only on

the next move will Black respond with …e7-e5) This gives White the
chance to go into the Old Indian with 2.d4. The choice between
these options is a matter of taste.
In the English Opening White usually fianchettos his king’s bishop.
Then he has four fundamentally different setups available to him:
1) ♘f3, d2-d3, 0-0 followed by queenside play – the main
variation;
2) d2-d3, e2-e4 and ♘ge2;
3) d2-d3, e2-e3 and ♘ge2;
4) e2-e3 and d2-d4
Against the main variation we build up on the kingside with 7…♕e8,
with the option …♕h5, looking to attack. The threatened attack with
…f5-f4 and …♗c8-h3 is hanging like the Sword of Damocles over
the white kingside and in a practical game offers good chances. But
in this main variation, as well as especially in the other three, it is
very helpful to pay attention to the possibilities for play on the
queen’s wing and in the center. In the closed King’s Indian
formation, which we looked at in Section 4, ‘White plays an early d4-
d5’ in Chapter 4, activity was initiated on two sides of the board,
queenside and kingside. Here, where the middle of the board was
not yet fixed, we play on three sections of the board – queenside,
kingside and center!
Section 1: White build-up with ♘f3, d2-d3
In order to better understand the attacking possibilities on the
kingside, we analyze first a game in which the main variation occurs
with colors reversed. It is of course somewhat easier to play with the
extra tempo of the first move, but here we are concerned first with
gaining familiarity with some fundamental ideas regarding the attack
against the opposing fianchetto position.
Game 41
Luke McShane 2615
Ivan Cheparinov 2667
Novi Sad 2009
1.e4 c5 2.d3 ♘c6 3.f4 g6 4.♘f3 ♗g7 5.♗e2 d6 6.0-0 ♘f6 7.♕e1 0-0

This is our main variation in the English Opening with colors
reversed. Top grandmaster Luke McShane uses the extra move to
work up immediate threats against the black king.
8.♕h4 c4
This pawn lever is logical. Of course, White does not care to give up
his e-pawn after 9.dxc4 ♘xe4, and the opening of the b6-g1
diagonal as well as the fifth rank increases the mobility of the black
queen. On the other hand, Black’s game loses flexibility on the left
side of the board. For example, he no longer has at his disposal the
maneuver …♘c6-d4 followed by ♘xd4, …cxd4!, when the c-file
would be opened against the backward c2-pawn. Moreover, after the
exchange …cxd3, cxd3 the path of the white king’s bishop to b3 (via
d1) is opened, and from this square it can effectively support the
attack.
8…♖b8, 8…b5 and 8…♘d4 were probably better. In view of the still
fairly closed position, however, this is not easy to judge, and the
engines are of only very limited help here.
9.♔h1
A useful waiting move, after which Black can no longer win a tempo
with …♕b6.
9…cxd3

9…♘b4 is possible, but after 10.♘e1∞ the Bulgarian GM would no
longer have …♗g4, which he clearly intended to play.
10.cxd3 ♗g4
With the exchange of the white king’s knight, Ivan Cheparinov,
formerly the second to Veselin Topalov, would like to reduce White’s
attacking potential on the kingside.
10…♕b6 11.♘c3 ♗g4 would transpose.
11.♘c3
11…♗xf3?!
In this game it is not only the mechanisms of the attack against the
fianchetto position that are instructive. It is also the uncertainty with
which the openings expert reacts to the extremely non-theoretical
white build-up. This is very revealing, and illustrates how difficult it is
to meet this attack in a practical game! After only 11 moves
Cheparinov comes up with an inaccuracy that will be difficult to
correct. The text move does remove from the attack the knight that
was intended for it, but now the squares f3 and h3 become available
to White’s rook.
A) 11…♕b6 was playable. Now, with 12.♖b1!?, White can slip in
a useful preparatory move. But 12.♘g5!, instead, forces Black to
take drastic measures – he must already give up his queen! 12…

♗xe2 13.♘d5! h6  14.♘xb6  axb6 15.♖e1 ♗xd3 16.♕h3! ♗c2
17.e5 dxe5 18.fxe5 hxg5 19.exf6 ♗xf6 20.♕e3 ;
B) 11…♖c8 was the better move. Here are a few sample
variations that show that the first player has good attacking
chances: 12.♖b1 (12.♗d2 e6 13.f5!?∞) 12…♕b6 (12…e6!? 13.f5
with the idea ♗g5) 13.♗d2 (13.♘g5? ♗xe2 14.♘d5? h6 15.♘xb6
axb6–+) 13…♖fe8 Black takes the mate at h7 out of the position.
Now it is not so easy to push the white attack forward. The bishop
at g4 bothers White, but it should not be chased off with h2-h3,
since then the maneuver ♖f1-f3-h3 would no longer be possible.
But with, say, the programmatic 14.f5 (14.♗d1!?; 14.a3!?) White
can create problems for his opponent. The defense 14…gxf5 is often
Black’s best option, even if at first glance the opening of his kingside
seems risky. After the exchange of the dark-squared bishops, the
monarch is placed relatively safely at h8, when Black can make use
of the open g-file: 15.♗h6 ♗xh6 16.♕xh6 ♗xf3 17.♗xf3 (17.♖xf3
♘e5 18.♖g3+ ♘g6 19.exf5 ♖xc3 20.fxg6 fxg6  and White gives
perpetual check; e.g. 21.♖f1 ♕xb2 22.♖xf6 exf6 23.♖xg6+) 17…
♘e5 18.exf5 ♘xd3 19.♕h4 ♕b4 20.♕g3+ ♔h8 21.♗xb7 ♕xb7
22.♕xd3 d5, when, over the long term, the central pawn mass
promises Black some chances, although in the process he must look
to the safety of his king.
12.♗xf3 ♕b6 13.♗d1
The bishop changes its side of the board and clears the f3-square for
the rook.
13.f5 and 13.g4 ♘d7 14.f5 also offer good prospects.
13…♕a6
After only 13 moves and only one substantial inaccuracy it is already
very difficult to prevent White’s plan of ♖f3-h3(g3) followed by
♗b3.
13…♘d4? 14.♕f2!  with the threat ♗e3.
14.♖f3 ♖fc8?
The rook clears f8 as an emergency exit for the king, but at the
same time this weakens f7.
14…h5 offered better chances to defend; e.g. 15.f5 ♘e5 16.♖g3
♘xd3 17.♗e3 ♘e5 18.♗b3  when White’s attack is very strong

(though he still has to find a way to break through).
15.♖h3?!
This move is quite natural, but it lets Black escape. It is interesting
to note how Luke McShane has not made any major commitments to
this point. He has prepared an attack but has neither sacrificed
material for it (e.g. after f4-f5) nor given his opponent important
squares. He does not want to do any of this until he is fairly certain
the attack will bear fruit.
15.f5! was more precise: 15…♘e5 16.♖h3 , with the threat
17.♘d5 and a very strong attack.
15…h5?!
Cheparinov misses his last chance.
After 15…h6 Black can defend his position; e.g. 16.g4!? (16.f5 g5
17.♗xg5 hxg5 18.♕xg5 is promising, but unclear: 18…♕b6 19.♖g3
♘e8 20.♗b3 ♕f2! 21.♖b1 ♕d4 22.♕h5 ♘d8 23.♖f1∞) 16…d5
17.e5 ♘e8 18.g5 hxg5 (18…h5 19.f5! ♗xe5 20.fxg6 fxg6 21.♘xd5
) 19.♕xg5 e6 20.♕h4
16.f5!  ♘e5 17.♗g5 ♔f8 18.fxg6?!
18.♗b3! followed by ♖f1 would have immediately involved all his
pieces in the attack. There would be no defense against the
numerous possible impacts on the g6-, f7-, and f6-squares.
18…fxg6?!

18…♘xg6! offers more resistance: 19.♕f2 (19.♕g3 ♖xc3! 20.bxc3
♘xe4 21.♕e3 ♗xc3 ) 19…♕a5 20.♗xf6 ♗xf6 21.♖xh5 ♕b6
22.♕d2 ♕b4 23.♗g4 ♖xc3 24.♖d1+–
19.♗b3! ♘xd3 20.♖f3
Black resigned.
Conclusion
The rather clumsy, but effective, attack with ♕e1-h4, with the idea
f4-f5 and ♗h6, is difficult to parry in a practical game, as inter alia
these short games involving top grandmasters demonstrate. This is
also true when the colors are reversed and without the advantage of
the first move.
In our analysis of the following game we combine this attacking plan
with flexible play on the queenside and in the center.
Game 42

Frankfurt 2015
1.c4 e5 2.♘c3 d6 3.g3 f5 4.♗g2 ♘f6 5.d3 ♗e7 6.♖b1
A great advantage of the English Opening is that it offers players an
abundance of possible transpositions, so that very often the
theoretical variations are left behind early in the game. It is just this
that Marcin Tazbir is clearly playing for.
6.♘f3 0-0 7.0-0 ♕e8

analysis diagram
This is the main variation in the English Opening with 2…d6, which
we saw in the previous game with colors reversed and with the
advantage of the first move. White controls the center and plans a
pawn storm on the left-hand side of the board with b2-b4. For Black
it is sensible to combine the attacking plan …♕h5 with flexible play
in the center. Striking out too early on the kingside involves the
danger that the attack will not get through. Then, too, White’s
advance on the queenside often leaves weaknesses in its train that
can be exploited.

Back to the game.
6…0-0 7.b4
The Polish grandmaster prefers play on the queen’s wing to
developing his kingside. After this move we were both on our own,
without a concrete knowledge of variations.
With 7.♘f3 Marcin could have offered to transpose into the main
variation, but this was not the intention behind 6.♖b1.

7…a6
This move is useful, since White’s queenside play cannot make
progress without a2-a4. Now, after b4-b5, the open file beckons to
Black. But careful! Even if Black is first to take control of the a-file, it
is not seldom the case that White takes back the file after the
ensuing ♗c1-d2(b2) followed by ♖b1-a1.
8.a4
White sees to it that he will soon get a pawn to b5. But this means
that the c5-square will no longer be covered by the b4-pawn; Black
could simply dislodge this pawn with …a7-a5. Before, White could
react with a2-a3, so that the c5-square would still be overprotected
by a pawn.
8…♔h8
It was clear that Marcin intended b4-b5, so I preferred the generally
useful king move to a futher weakening of the queenside with …a6-
a5.
After 8…a5?! 9.b5 ♘bd7  the knight will look good on c5 for a
while, but the queenside will be under pressure and it is difficult to
develop. The continuation with opening the a-file (in favor of Black)
is better.
9.b5
But now this is hasty. White would have done better to complete his
development first: 9.♘f3 c6 10.0-0 ♗e6 (in the case of ♘g5, the
bishop could withdraw to g8 thanks to the king move) 11.b5 axb5
12.axb5 ♕c7 Black has now consolidated his queenside and despite
White’s space advantage does not stand worse. He can fight for the
a- and b-files after …♘bd7 and at the same time threaten possible
advances in the center, …e5-e4 or …d6-d5 (12…♕e8, with threats
against the kingside, is also quite playable, just not 12…♘bd7?
13.bxc6 bxc6 14.♘g5 , or 12…h6 13.♕b3 ♘bd7? 14.♘h4 ).

9…♘bd7
The c5-square beckons. We open the a-file when it is clear that it
will benefit Black at least as much as it does White.
10.♘f3
A) 10.bxa6?! illustrates the fact that the attack will lack sufficient
penetrating force if White has not completed his development: 10…
♖xa6 11.♗xb7?? ♗xb7 12.♖xb7 ♕a8–+;
B) The build-up with e2-e3 and ♘ge2 does not suit the early
queenside advance. After 10.e3? axb5 11.axb5 e4! Black opens the
position and covers the numerous weaknesses created by the tempi-
devouring pawn storm on the queenside; e.g. 12.dxe4 fxe4 13.♘ge2
(13.♘xe4?! ♘xe4 14.♗xe4 ♘c5 15.♗c2 – the bishop has to guard
the f5-b1 diagonal, but now the weak light squares on the kingside
are neglected: 15…♗f6! ) 13…♘c5 .
10…♘c5
The knight stabilizes the queenside and supports the …e5-e4
advance.
11.♘d2
Now the opening of the center with …d6-d5 is on offer, after which
the c5-square will be a permanent outpost. Generally speaking,
White should not neglect the control of the center when attacking on
the flank.

11.0-0 was better, since the 11…e4 advance is not dangerous
because of 12.♘d4!, when the white knight is well placed in the
center.
11…axb5 12.axb5 ♗e6 13.0-0
13…d5
Black could also keep the game closed. After …d6-d5, however,
Black’s position is the more enjoyable to play in view of the active
knight on c5.
13…♕d7 14.♘d5 ♘xd5 15.cxd5 ♗f7 16.♘c4 b6= is also perfectly
good, the outpost on c5 making the backward b7-pawn unassailable.
14.cxd5 ♘xd5 15.♗b2= ♗f6
15…♘b6 was better. Black has more space and can comfortably
avoid the exchange of pieces.
16.♕c1 b6 17.♘xd5 ♗xd5 18.♗xd5 ♕xd5 19.♕c4

The chances for both sides are about even. In the ensuing play, after
the advance …e5-e4, two noticeable weaknesses appear in the white
position: the pawns at d3 and b5. Black was able to break through
to a win after errors on both sides:

Conclusion
In this game, flexibly postponing the development of the queen’s
knight led, after the early pawn storm with b4-b5, to Black’s
exploitation of the weak light squares on the queenside.
Section 2: White’s build-up d3, e4, ♘ge2
Game 43
Ram Soffer 2479

Anton Demchenko 2595
St Petersburg 2015
1.g3 e5 2.c4 d6
The Russian grandmaster Anton Demchenko, against 1.g3, chooses
our repertoire line, about which there is more in Chapter 7, ‘Flank
openings.’ After 2.c4 we are in the English Opening.
3.♘c3 ♗e7 4.♗g2 f5 5.d3 ♘f6 6.e4 c6
Black blocks the long diagonal so that the queen’s bishop no longer
has to protect the b7-pawn.
Those players fond of experimenting can also sacrifice the pawn.
After 6…0-0!? White, with 7.♘ge2 c6 can go into the game
continuation, or with 7.exf5 ♗xf5 8.♗xb7 bring about unclear
complications; e.g. 8…♘bd7 9.♗xa8 ♕xa8 10.♕f3 ♕xf3 11.♘xf3
♗xd3 . In view of the central pawn mass, the king held in the
center of the board, and the bleak prospects of the white rook,
White’s position is in practice very difficult to play.
7.♘ge2 0-0 8.0-0 ♘a6
This is the standard build-up against the system with e2-e4 and
♘ge2. Black can develop all his pieces comfortably and prepare
himself well for his opponent’s only active plan, h2-h3 followed by
exf5, g3-g4 and then d3-d4 or ♘e2-g3.
9.h3 fxe4

9…h6!?N 10.exf5 ♗xf5∞ is also possible; e.g. 11.f4 (11.g4 ♗h7=)
11…exf4 12.♘xf4 ♕d7 13.g4 ♗h7 14.♗e3 g5 15.♘fe2 ♘c5 .
10.♘xe4
Inasmuch as the e2-knight, in view of the e5-pawn, does not have a
good square, the grandmaster from Israel trades off a knight.
After 10.dxe4 White needs the move g3-g4 to activate all his pieces.
10…♘c5 The pawn formation on the left-hand side of the board
reminds us a bit of the Boleslavsky Wall, which we are familiar with
from the Old Indian Defense. And in fact here too pressure can be
built up against the white queenside, beginning with …♗e6 and –
after b2-b3 – …a7-a5, …♕b6 and …a5-a4. In view of the closed
long diagonal g2-a8 Black can, however look to expand with …a7-a6
and …b7-b5; e.g. 11.♗e3 ♗e6N 12.b3 ♕c8 13.g4. This devalues
the f2-f4 lever, which would now burden White with an isolani on e4
(13.♔h2 ♕e8 …♕h5): 13…♕c7  with the idea …a7-a6 and …b7-
b5. White’s b3-b4 is nothing to fear by reason of the vulnerability of
the c4-pawn.
10…♗e6
Black threatens 11…♘xe4, winning a pawn.
10…♔h8!?N is an interesting waiting move, creating a refuge for the
queen’s bishop on g8. But how can we be sure that White will not
make good use of the extra tempo?

11.♘g5 ♗d7 12.♘c3
Now we come to the planned knight exchange and further
simplification. But it is not easy to attack Black’s solid formation.
After 12.f4 Black could complete his development with 12…♕b6+
13.♔h1 ♖ad8 .
12…h6 13.♘ge4 ♘xe4 14.dxe4
Soffer does not care to allow his opponent a mobile pawn center:
14.♘xe4 ♗e6 15.♘c3 ♕d7 16.♔h2 d5
14…♗e6 15.b3 ♕d7 16.♔h2
The black position is very solid and all pieces have good squares. An
advance of the white majority on the kingside is not altogether
without risk. The position offers approximately even chances.
16…♗g5 17.♗a3
The first player prefers not to trade off his bishop.
A) Even if 17.f4 seems premature, in view of the delayed
development of White’s queenside it is still quite playable; e.g. 17…
exf4 18.gxf4 ♗f6 19.♕d2  g5!?;
B) Then again, after 17.♗xg5 hxg5 White cannot exploit the
weaknesses of the black structure on the kingside: 18.♕d2 ♕e7
19.♘d1 ♖ad8 20.♘e3 g6= with the idea of maneuvering the knight
to d4.
17…♖ad8 18.♕e2 ♕c7 19.♖ad1 ♕a5 20.♗b2 ♘c5 21.♕c2

The configuration on the left-hand side of the board again resembles
the Boleslavsky Wall. Black can choose between the advance …a7-
a5-a4 and the attack on the well-fortified c4-pawn with …a7-a6 and
…b7-b5. Then White is almost forced to play c4xb5, when Black gets
the half-open a-file and a mobile pawn mass in the center. In the
game Demchenko decided on …a7-a5, but in hindsight, the
alternative …a7-a6 followed by …b7-b5 looks more promising.
21…♕b6 21…a6! 22.♗a1 b5 23.cxb5 axb5 24.♘e2 ♗e7 25.f4 ♖a8  (25…

½-½
Conclusion
Against the system e2-e4 and ♘ge2 Black gets good development
with …c7-c6 followed by …♗e6 and …♘a6. The expansion with …
a7-a6 and …b7-b5 promises Black good chances on the queenside.
Section 3: White build-up with d3, e3, ♘ge2

Game 44
Vitaly Sivuk 2566
Deepan Chakkravarthy 2478
Chennai 2016
1.c4 e5 2.g3 f5
2…d6 3.♗g2 f5 4.d3 ♗e7 5.♘c3 ♘f6 is our repertoire line.
3.♗g2 ♘f6 4.d3 ♗e7 5.♘c3 d6 6.e3 0-0 7.♘ge2 c6 8.0-0 ♗e6
The white setup with e2-e3 and ♘ge2 looks harmonious and is very
flexible. Depending on the course of events, the first player can
become active on the kingside (f2-f4), in the center (with e3-e4 or
d3-d4) or on the queenside (with b2-b4-b5). Moreover, a black try
for an attack with …f5-f4 is just about ruled out – the push simply
loses a pawn. On the other hand, White is not exerting any pressure,
so Black can comfortably complete his development with …♘bd7
and, for example after …♖c8, prepare …a7-a6 and …b7-b5 on the
queenside or …d6-d5 in the center.
9.b3
White supports the c4-pawn, which is indispensable for a later d3-
d4.
A) 9.f4 is very popular in this position, but it does leave behind a
pawn weakness on e3 that from now on has to be protected by

pieces. The opening of the f- and d-files with fxe5 is also not to be
feared: 9…♘bd7 and now:
A1) 10.b3 ♖c8!? 11.h3 ♖e8N followed by …♗f8, …a7-a6 and …
b7-b5, perhaps also …g7-g6 and …♗f7;
A2) 10.b4 a6 11.♖b1 ♖e8N 12.a4 (12.b5?! axb5 13.cxb5 –
granting the second player a central pawn majority and the half-
open a-file – 13…♕c7 ) 12…♗f8 Black is very flexibly placed and it
is not clear how White can proceed. If the pawn storm does not
show positive results, the weaknesses may work out negatively for
White. Black plans, for instance, …♗e6-f7-h5; e.g. 13.♕c2 ♗f7!?
(13…♖c8) 14.fxe5 ♘xe5 15.b5 (15.♖xf5?! ♗g6 ) 15…axb5
16.axb5 d5 17.bxc6 bxc6 18.cxd5 cxd5 19.♖xf5 ♖c8  (19…♘eg4!?
);
A3) 10.♗d2 ♖c8N=
B) The first player can also prepare the b2-b4-b5 advance with
9.♖b1. After 9…♘bd7 10.b4 a6 11.a4 ♔h8, however, Black is well
set up and would profit from a file opening on the queenside hardly
less than would White: 12.a5 (12.b5 axb5 13.axb5 ♕c7 ) 12…♖c8=
9…♘bd7 10.f4
10…♘g4?!
The purpose of this knight excursion is not altogether clear. The
move h2-h3 provoked by it suits White’s build-up, and the tempi lost

through it would have been better invested elsewhere. Black can
exploit the knight development to e2 in thematic fashion with the
lever …h7-h5-h4, although in most cases White simply takes the
pawn and occupies the g-file. In this case, too, h2-h3 helps more
than it hurts.
Of course, 10…♖c8 comes into consideration, transposing to the
variation 9.f4 ♘bd7 10.b3.
11.h3 ♘gf6 12.fxe5
The young grandmaster from Ukraine clarifies the pawn structure.
But even after the stronger 12.d4 ♕c7 the second player is relatively
safe (12…e4?! 13.d5! ). To be sure, White can force Black to close
the center with 13.♗a3! e4! (13…♖ae8?? 14.fxe5 dxe5 15.♗xe7
♖xe7 16.d5!+–) After 14.d5 ♗f7  15.♘d4 g6 White has a good
lever with g3-g4, which secures for him an unpleasant initiative.
Black can still hold the game, but it was not a good idea for him to
give away two tempi! Here is a sample variation: 16.g4 ♕a5!
17.♗b2 cxd5 18.g5 ♘h5 19.♘xd5 ♗xd5 20.cxd5 ♕xd5 21.♕d2
♖fc8 22.♖fc1 ♗f8 23.♖xc8 ♖xc8 24.♗f1 ♘b6 25.♔h2 (25.a4
♘g3) 25…a6 26.a4 ♕f7 27.a5 ♘d7 28.b4
12…♘xe5
After 12…dxe5, 13.d4 is the natural lever in the position. Black can,
however, choose whether or not to force the play. We see an
important motif here: in the case of an opening of the position after
dxe5 or d4-d5, the weaknesses in the vicinity of e3 come to light;
e.g.
A) 13…♕c7 14.d5 ♗f7 15.♖xf5 ♗g6 16.♖f1 ♘c5 ;
B) 13…♗d6!? 14.d5 cxd5 15.cxd5 ♗f7 16.♖xf5 ♗g6 17.♖f1
♖c8 ;
C) 13…♕b6 14.dxe5 (14.d5 cxd5 15.cxd5 ♗f7 16.♖xf5 ♗g6
17.♖f1 ♖ac8 ) 14…♘xe5 15.♘d4 ♗c8 16.♘xf5 ♗xf5 17.♖xf5
♖ad8 18.♕c2 ♘d3

The Indian grandmaster abstains from opening the d-file. Black’s
structure is sound and can in principle tolerate even the exchange of
the light-squared bishop for a knight. It is true that the first player
remains with an active knight outpost that guarantees him the
advantage.
13.d4
The advance of this pawn to d5 is powerful, but White should have
traded off Black’s queen’s bishop first.
Better is 13.♘d4! ♕c8 14.♘xe6 ♕xe6 15.♘e2! . After the
exchange of the light-squared bishop the vulnerable f5-pawn must
be supported with …g7-g6, so that the knight on f4 is actively placed
and in practice cannot be driven away. White has the advantage;
e.g. 15…g6 16.♘f4 ♕d7 17.♗b2 ♖ae8 18.d4 ♘f7 19.d5! ♗d8
20.♘e6 ♖xe6 21.dxe6 ♕xe6 22.♔h2 .
13…♘f7 14.d5 ♗d7 15.♘d4 ♕c8
Black can protect everything, but he must be careful with the
structurally significant …c6-c5, since his opponent could get clear
light-square dominance with the typical pawn-sacrifice ♘e6!.
16.dxc6
After 16.♕c2 Black’s position also seems to hold, even if after 16…
g6 17.e4 ♘h5! 18.♔h2 ♗f6 19.dxc6 bxc6 20.exf5!? he has to
withstand a dangerous attack; e.g. 20…♗xd4 21.fxg6 ♘e5 22.♗h6
♗f5 23.♕d2 ♗xc3 24.♕xc3 ♖f6∞.

16…bxc6 17.♕c2 g6
The position is approximately level. After some exciting play Black
was able to score the win:
18.e4?! 18.♗b2 ♘h5 (18…♕c7 19.e4) 19.♕f2 ♘e5 20.♖ad1 ♘f6= 18.♔h2
♘h5 19.♘de2 ♗f6 20.♘f4= 18…♘h5! 19.♘de2 19.♔h2 ♗f6 20.exf5
transposes to the variation 16.♕c2 19…♗f6  20.♗b2 ♗e5 21.♔h2?! ≥
21.exf5 ♗xf5 22.♖xf5 gxf5 23.♖f1  21…♕d8?! 21…♘xg3! 22.♘xg3 f4
23.♘ce2 fxg3+ 24.♘xg3 ♕e8  22.♘a4?! 22.exf5! gxf5 23.♕d2!  ♕h4
24.♘e4! 22…♘xg3 23.♘xg3 f4 24.♗xe5 ♘xe5 25.♘f5 gxf5 25…♕g5!?
26.♖xf4 ♘g6 27.♖ff1 f4  28.c5 ♕g5 29.♕c3 ♘e5?! 29…f3! 30.♖xf3 ♖xf3

35…♖d2+–+ 36.♖g2 ♖d3! 37.♗xd3 ♖xd3 38.♕xd3 ♘xd3
39.♖ag1 ♕e8
0-1
Conclusion
The build-up with e2-e3 and ♘ge2 does not pose any problems for
Black. He completes his development with …c7-c6, …♗e6 and …
♘bd7 and can, among other ideas, fight for the initiative on the
queenside with …♖c8, …a7-a6 and …b7-b5.
Section 4: White’s build-up with e3, d4, ♘ge2
Game 45

Oskar von Bahr 2384
Tiger Hillarp Persson 2539
Sweden tt 2015/16
1.c4 d6 2.g3 e5 3.♗g2 f5 4.♘c3 ♘f6
4…♗e7 first is also possible. 5.d4 ♘f6 then leads by transposition to
the game. If White instead secures the bishop pair with 5.♘d5 he
will hardly benefit from it: 5…♘f6 6.♘xe7 ♕xe7 7.d3 0-0 The
second player has won two tempi through the exchange and can
now safely place his pawns on the dark squares. A possible build-up
would be 8.♘f3 c5 9.0-0 ♗d7 10.b3 (10.♘h4 ♘c6 11.♗g5 ♕f7
12.a3 h6 13.♗d2 ♖ae8 ) 10…♗c6 11.♗b2 ♘a6= followed by …
♘c7-e6-d4. Black is very solidly placed and can fight for the
initiative in all three sectors of the board. In view of the closed
position, as well as the possibility of an exchange on the light
squares, the bishop pair offers the first player no advantage.
5.d4 ♗e7 6.e3
With 6.♘f3 the first player can increase his pressure on e5 and force
Black into a reaction. After 6…e4! 7.♘g5 c6 8.d5 (8.♘h3 ♘a6 with
the idea …♘c7 and …d6-d5 9.♗g5 ♗e6 10.d5 ♗f7 11.f3 exf3
12.♗xf3 0-0 )
analysis diagram

he has cut off the black king’s pawn, which has forged ahead, away
from protection by …d6-d5, and looks to open the position with f2-
f3. But Black can assert himself well enough:
A) 8…♘xd5 is the tactical solution: 9.♘gxe4 ♘b6 10.♘d2 ♗e6
(10…♗f6; 10…0-0=) 11.b3 d5 (11…♗f6 12.♗b2 0-0) 12.cxd5
♘xd5 13.♗b2 ♗f6 14.♕c2 ♘xc3 (14…♘a6=) 15.♗xc3 0-0 16.0-0
♘d7 17.♖ad1  1-0 (55) Bocharov-Zvjagintsev, Kaliningrad 2015;
B) 8…0-0 9.0-0 ♘g4 exploits the first player’s positional
concessions (9…♘a6!? and; 9…h6 10.♘h3 ♘bd7 also comes into
question): 10.♘h3 (10.♘e6?! ♗xe6 11.dxe6 ♘a6 ) 10…♖e8 (10…
♗f6?! 11.dxc6N bxc6 12.♘d5! ) 11.f3 (11.dxc6 bxc6 12.♘d5 ♗f8)
11…exf3 12.exf3 ♘e5=
6…c6
7.♘ge2
With this setup, too, White refrains from putting pressure on the
black center, with the result that the second player can develop his
game comfortably.
7.♘f3?! at this point, however, makes no sense. After 7…e4 8.♘d2
White is in fact playing a French Defense with colors reversed and
with the fianchetto of his king’s bishop. Black can maintain his pawn
chain c6-d5-e4 and secure for himself a long-term space advantage.
After 8…d5  the queen’s knight comes into the game via …♘a6-c7-

e6. Should White castle kingside, then an attack on the king with …
h7-h5-h4 is possible.
7…0-0 8.0-0
8…♘a6
The knight prevents b2-b4 and is to be developed at c7.
Kasparov played 8…a5!? here, forestalling a later b2-b4. The move is
quite playable, but it defines the role of the a-pawn prematurely:
9.c5?! (9.b3 ♘a6 10.♗b2 e4= 11.d5?! ♘c5 ) 9…e4 10.cxd6 ♗xd6
11.b3 ♘a6  0-1 (35) KEB-Kasparov, ICC INT 1998.
Our repertoire move is 8…♗e6. The a-pawn, after …a7-a6, could
help attack the white c-pawn later with …b7-b5. 9.b3 ♗f7 (not 9…
♘bd7?!, since Black is forced to exchange on d5 after 10.d5! , but
9…♘a6!? is quite possible) 10.♗b2 ♘bd7, with a flexible game over
the whole board; e.g. 11.e4 fxe4 12.♘xe4 ♘xe4 13.♗xe4 d5
14.♗f5 e4 15.♘f4 ♘f6=.

9.b3
White dispenses with b2-b4-b5, which likewise does not secure him
a clear initiative.
After 9.♖b1 ♗e6 10.d5 ♗d7 the first player gets in b2-b4. But
Black’s pieces are very harmoniously positioned despite the lack of
space and are ready, potentially, to occupy the holes in the white
formation; e.g. 11.b4 (11.dxc6N bxc6 12.b4 ♖b8 13.♕a4 ♖b6 )
11…♘c7N 12.dxc6 ♗xc6 13.e4 ♘xe4 14.♘xe4 ♗xe4 15.♗xe4 fxe4
16.♘c3 ♕d7 17.♘xe4 b5 18.cxb5 ♘xb5 .
9…e4
The clever thing is to wait to play this move only after the white
queen’s bishop goes to b2, as then the e3-pawn would be
unprotected after the lever f2-f3.
9…♗d7 promises Black full-fledged play; e.g. 10.♗b2 (10.♗a3N
♕e8 , with ideas like …♖d8 and …b7-b5) 10…e4 11.f3N (11.d5?!N
♘c5 ) 11…d5 12.fxe4 dxe4! . This recapture is an important option
in the French formation. White now has a sound majority on the
queenside, true, but the weaknesses at e3 and d3, the lack of space
on the kingside, and the limited mobility of the white king’s bishop
weigh heavily against him. Black has very good prospects on the
right-hand side of the board.
10.d5 c5?!

In principle the Swedish grandmaster has now reached a very sound
structure. Black has the lever …b7-b5, the b4- and e5-squares for
his knights, and the long diagonal for his king’s bishop after …♗f6.
Unfortunately, this formation is destroyed by White’s next move!
10…♘c5 11.♕d2 (11.b4?! ♘d3 12.♘f4 ♘e5 ) 11…a5 , 10…
♘g4!?, 10…♗d7 and 10…♘c7, cutting off the d5-pawn from
support by e3-e4, were good alternatives, in each case with about
even chances.
11.f3!
The FIDE Master Oskar von Bahr, also from Sweden, jumps at the
opportunity and opens the position on the kingside.
11…exf3 12.♗xf3 ♘c7 13.♘f4
White now threatens e3-e4, when all his kingside pieces are
becoming active. On the other hand, Black’s counterplay with …b7-
b5 fails to the resource ♘e6, opening the position to White’s
advantage.
13…♘g4
Hillarp Persson accepts the doubled pawn to take the strength out of
e3-e4.
13…♗d7 14.♗b2 b5?! 15.♘e6
14.♗xg4
14.e4? ♗f6
14…fxg4

White can bear the loss of the king’s bishop, since a queen-bishop
battery on the a8-h1 diagonal is not expected. With both knights
and the dark-squared bishop, however, pushing e3-e4-e5 is
becoming a real option. This would destroy the black structure.
15.♗b2 ♗f6 16.♕d2 ♕e8 17.♖ae1
White has the better structure and enough opportunities to improve
his position, for example through the exchange of the dark-squared
bishops and the subsequent transfer of the queen’s knight to f2.
Black’s counterplay with …b7-b5, in contrast, does not work well, but
what else can he undertake?
17…♖b8
The grandmaster makes a preparatory move but fails to get any
effective counterplay.
Nor does the immediate  17…b5 improve Black’s situation; e.g.
18.♘xb5 ♘xb5 19.♗xf6 ♖xf6 20.cxb5 ♕e4! (20…♕xb5 21.e4 ♗a6
22.♖f2 c4 23.♕d4 ♕b6 24.♕xb6 axb6 ) 21.a4! (21.♕g2?! ♗f5=;
21.♕a5?! ♗f5 22.b6 ♖f7=; 21.♕c3?! ♗f5=) 21…♗f5 22.b4!,
when White’s superiority on the queenside puts Black in a critical
situation.
18.e4
Von Bahr keeps his position under control and in the ensuing play
wins a well-deserved point.

18…b5 19.♘xb5 ♘xb5 20.cxb5 ♖xb5 21.♗xf6 gxf6  22.♘d3 ♖b6
23.♖f4 ♖a6 24.♖ef1 ♕e7 25.♖1f2 ♔g7 26.♕c3 h5 27.b4 c4 27…cxb4

1-0
Conclusion
Against the build-up with d2-d4, e2-e3 and ♘ge2, too, Black gets a
good game with the flexible formation …c7-c6, …♗e6 and …♘bd7
or …♘a6.

In the seventh and last chapter of our little d6-repertoire we
consider the flank systems. These rarely occur in practical play, and
the next most common moves (after 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.♘f3 and 1.c4),
1.g3 and 1.f4, are about ten times less frequent than 1.c4. Hence
we do not analyze these variants in detail, but with the help of
model play show how you can use the formations discussed, in most
cases intensively, in our repertoire.
Game 46
Gilles Miralles 2451
Victor Bologan 2630
France tt 2003
1.b4
In the former Soviet Union this was called the Sokolsky Opening; in
the West the term ‘Orangutan’ has been used. Whatever we wish to
call it, White forgoes the immediate occupation of the center and
initiates a typical pawn roller on the queenside. Here we can adopt
our standard build-up against the English Opening.
1…e5 2.♗b2 d6 3.g3
The French grandmaster plays the opening according to English
models. We soon arrive, by transposition, at our main variation from
Chapter 6, only with the early b2-b4 and ♗b2, which pose no
particular danger to Black.
Even when White does not fianchetto the king’s bishop, the build-up
with …♘f6, …♗e7 and …0-0 is quite playable, although Black
should do without the early …f7-f5 if the first player can afterwards
activate his bishop favorably with d2-d4. Here is how further
development might go: 3.e3 ♗e7 (3…f5 4.d4! ) 4.c4 ♘f6 5.♘f3 0-0
6.♘c3 c6 7.♕c2 h6 8.♗e2 The early expansion on the queenside is
a futile gesture; Black can, among other choices, simplify
comfortably down the a-file and play in the center: 8…a5 9.a3 axb4
10.axb4 ♖xa1+ 11.♗xa1 ♗e6 followed by…♘bd7, with a solid
position.
3…f5 4.♗g2

4.d4N makes little sense in view of the hanging pawn on b4. With
4…♘c6 5.dxe5 dxe5 Black takes over the initiative.
4…♘f6 5.c4 ♗e7 6.♕b3
This ‘strengthening’ of the queenside advance also threatens
nothing.
6.d3 is more natural.
6…0-0 7.♘f3?! ♔h8
The Moldovan grandmaster, known for his opening books and DVDs,
renounces the attempt to reveal the disadvantages of White’s last
move. After all, Black is in no need of any special measures.
7…e4! would have disturbed White’s development; e.g., 8.♘d4 c5
9.bxc5 dxc5 10.♘c2 ♘c6 .
8.0-0 ♕e8 9.♘c3
We discussed positions of this type in depth in Chapter 6 (on the
English Opening).
9…♕h5
Bologan quickly initiates an attack on the kingside.
The second player, with 9…c6, can get flexible play on both sides of
the board, e.g. 10.b5 ♘bd7=.
10.♘d5
The opening of the c-file no longer helps White.
But even the normal 10.d3 would have exposed the white king to
danger. Here is a sample variation: 10…f4!? (10…♗e6 11.d4!∞)

11.gxf4 ♗h3 12.♗xh3 ♕xh3 13.♔h1 ♘g4 14.♘d5  ♖f5! 15.♘e3
♘xh2 16.♘g1 ♕h5 17.♘xf5 ♘xf1+ 18.♔g2 ♕xf5
10…♘xd5
10…♗d8 is also good.
11.cxd5 ♘d7
There are no threats involved in the early development of the
queenside by ♗b2 and ♕b3, so Black can play undisturbed on the
right-hand side of the board. At the very least the white queen’s
bishop, and also the queen herself, could better counteract Black’s
attack from their original squares.
12.d3 ♘f6
The knight approaches the kingside. In the ensuing play Miralles
does not succeed in finding the best defense and in the end Black’s
attack breaks through.
12…a5 13.a3 f4 14.♖ac1 ♗d8

0-1

Conclusion
Against 1.b4 Black can set up comfortably with 1…e5 followed by 2…
d6, …♗e7, …♘f6 and …0-0, which we know well from the previous
chapter. Only in the event of an early …f7-f5 is caution indicated, if
White does not fianchetto his king’s bishop.
Game 47
Hikaru Nakamura 2776
Viswanathan Anand 2773
Zurich Rapid 2014
1.b3
This move is usually named for Aron Nimzowitsch and Bent Larsen –
the ‘Nimzo-Larsen Attack,’ or the like. Here, too, the standard build-
up with …e7-e5, …d7-d6 and …♗e7 works quite well, as ex-World
Champion Viswanathan Anand demonstrates.
1.♘f3 d6 2.b3 e5 3.e4 ♘f6 4.♘c3 ♗e7 5.♗b2 0-0 6.d4 exd4
7.♕xd4 ♘c6 8.♕d2 a5!N would constitute a similar development,
which, analogous to the game, reminds us very much of positions in
the Antoshin Variation. The threat …a5-a4 secures good play for
Black.
1…e5 2.♗b2 d6
3.e3

The American superstar prepares the development of his king’s
bishop on the e2-b5 diagonal.
If, with 3.g3, White also fianchettos the king’s bishop after the
queen’s bishop, we must again take care with …f7-f5, as the first
player can often get the initiative with d2-d4: 3…c6 (3…f5 4.d4!)
4.♗g2 ♗e7 5.c4 ♘f6 (5…f5 is possible, and is recommended for
independent analysis; White can now build up pressure in the center
with 6.d4!?, with the idea 6…e4?! 7.d5! ) 6.♘f3 0-0 7.0-0 ♖e8
8.♘c3
analysis diagram
We are familiar with this build-up from the Old Indian. White has
been kind enough, though, not to exert pressure on the e5-pawn, so
we can develop the queen’s knight without blocking the queen’s
bishop; e.g. 8…♘a6, with a sound position. For the transition to a
French structure with colors reversed after 9.d4 e4 (9…exd4
10.♘xd4 ♗f8  might well lead by transposition to the variations of
the Old Indian investigated in Chapter 4, in which Black, with …♘c5
and …a7-a5, seeks to set up the Boleslavsky Wall) 10.♘e1 d5 , the
moves b2-b3 (making ♕b3 impossible) and ♗b2 are rather counter-
productive. Black takes over more and more space and can work
towards an attack on the kingside – e.g. with a later …h7-h5-h4.

3…♘f6
Simple development.
3…f5 is risky because of 4.d4! .
4.d4
d2-d4 is really the only central lever that White can use to fight for
the initiative, although he can also improve his central control first
with c2-c4.
4.c4 ♗e7 5.d4 is the alternative:
A) 5…♘bd7 6.♘f3 c6 now leads to Old Indian positions, since
7.dxe5 dxe5 8.♘xe5?? fails to 8…♕a5+ 9.♗c3 ♗b4–+, while
8.♗xe5?! ♘xe5 9.♕xd8+ ♗xd8 10.♘xe5 ♗a5+ 11.♔e2
concedes Black too much compensation for the sacrificed pawns;
B) Black, however, can show with 5…0-0N, also, that for the first
player it is not altogether safe to develop slowly and then open the
position. Here is a sample variation: 6.♘c3 (6.dxe5?! dxe5 7.♕xd8
♖xd8 8.♗xe5 ♗f5!? , threatening 9…♘c6) 6…exd4 7.♕xd4
(7.exd4 d5=) 7…♗f5N with good development and possible ideas
like …♘c6, …a7-a5-a4 or …c7-c6 followed by …d6-d5: 8.♘d5
(8.♘ge2 c6!? is more circumspect) 8…♘c6
analysis diagram
B1) 9.♕c3 ♘e5! 10.♘xe7+ ♕xe7 11.f3 ♖fe8 12.0-0-0 (12.e4?
♗xe4! 13.fxe4? ♘xe4–+) 12…a5 13.a4 b5!!. It was the computer, of

course, that suggested this hammer blow. But it is quite logical.
Human players, too, can find such levers, by which the opponent’s
(seemingly) unattackable pawn chain is broken up, as Anand
(among others) showed in the decisive 11th game of his match with
Magnus Carlsen in 2014. 14.cxb5 c6;
B2) 9.♘xe7+ ♕xe7 10.♕f4 ♗g6 11.♗xf6 gxf6!  with the threat
…♘b4;
B3) 9.♕f4 ♘xd5 10.cxd5 ♗f6 11.♗xf6 ♕xf6 12.♖d1 ♕c3+
13.♖d2 ♘e7 14.♗e2=
4…exd4
Anand opens the center.
4…♘bd7 is also playable here.
5.♕xd4 ♘c6 6.♕d2 ♗e7
The simple solution.
6…♘e4!? 7.♕d1N (7.♕d5 ♘f6N) 7…d5 and 6…d5N 7.♘c3 (7.♗b5
♗d7 8.♘c3 ♗b4) 7…♗b4 8.♗d3 0-0= are two suggestions for
independent analysis for those who like to experiment. In our
repertoire, however, the d-pawn is happy to remain on d6 for a
while.
7.♘c3 0-0 8.0-0-0
We are already familiar with this position from the Antoshin
Variation, but in that situation the pawn was on e4 instead of e3.

Castling queenside, along with the fianchetto of the queen’s bishop,
clearly indicates a dangerous kingside attack. All the same, the
second player can hold with the lever …a7-(a6)-a5-a4.
8…a6
Anand prepares the fianchetto of the queen’s bishop. From b7 it can
control the center and pressurize the white kingside should
Nakamura advance on that side with g2-g4.
9.f3 b5 10.g4
Just as in the Antoshin Variation this attack is highly dangerous here.
If 10.e4 ♖b8!? followed by …b5-b4 and, should White not put his
knight offside at a4, a later …a6-a5-a4.
10…b4! 11.♘ce2
The knight cannot very well move to the center of the board.
11.♘d5?! ♘xd5 12.♕xd5 ♗b7  and …♗f6.
11…a5
The b4-pawn is now well protected, and soon Black will be able to
open a file in front of the white king with …a5-a4.
11…♗b7 and 11…♘d7 are possible alternatives, in each case with
an unclear game.
12.♘g3
12.♗g2 ♗b7 13.g5 ♘d7 14.f4 ♕b8 15.h4 a4
The two top players have reached a very double-edged position with
attacks against both kings. Unfortunately, what happens now with

the best in the world is what occurs sometimes in speed chess: the
former World Champion overlooks something and puts his knight on
the wrong square!
12…♘e8?
A mistake that, at the highest level, can be explained only by the
stress and speed of a rapid chess game.
After 12…♘d7 13.f4 ♗f6= or 12…a4!? 13.g5 (13.♗b5 ♗b7
14.♗xa4 ♖xa4 15.bxa4 ♘d7 ) 13…♘d7  the chances were about
even.
13.♕d5! ♗b7 14.♗b5 ♘e5 15.♕xb7 ♖b8 16.♕d5 ♘f6 17.♕xe5! dxe5
18.♖xd8 ♖fxd8 19.♗d3 ♗c5 20.♗xe5 ♗xe3+ 21.♔b1 ♘d5 22.♘f5 ♗d2
23.♗xg7 ♘f4 24.♘e2 ♘xd3 25.cxd3 ♖xd3 26.♔c2
1-0
Conclusion
Against 1.b3, too, the standard build-up with …e7-e5, …d7-d6, …
♗e7, …♘f6 and …0-0 is playable.
In the following game we look at the opening 1.g3, after which we
develop with 1…e5 2.♗g2 ♘f6 3.d3 d6 followed by …♗e7 and …0-
0, according to established patterns. Quite often, White will go into
the English with c2-c4.
After 4.c4 ♗e7 we have landed in the English Opening, except that
Black has not played an early …f7-f5. But this is not a problem, since
Black’s formation is very sound: he can develop comfortably and
look to play the central expansion …c7-c6 and …d6-d5 or, regardless
of what White does, play on the queenside, for instance with 5.♘c3
(5.♘f3 0-0 6.♘c3 c6 7.0-0 h6 8.♖b1 ♗e6 9.b4 ♘bd7 10.b5 d5=)
5…0-0 6.e4 c6 7.♘ge2 a6 and …b7-b5.
It is true that White can also play 4.e4, after which 4…♗e7 5.♘f3
transposes to the game. If White opts instead for 5.f4, in the style of
the King’s Gambit, we arrive after 5…c6 6.♘f3 0-0N at a position
that we investigated in Chapter 3 (the side variations after 1.e4 d6),
although in that case the white king’s bishop was on c4, where it
certainly exerts more pressure on Black’s game. In the position that
we have before us, however, Black can develop comfortably. He
should of course keep in mind White’s plan to work up a dangerous

kingside attack after f4-f5 and g3-g4-g5, countering it in the center
at the right moment with …d6-d5, as circumstances dictate.
Game 48
Dmitry Darmin 2356
Robert Jamilov 2418
Ufa 2012
1.e4 d6 2.♘f3 ♘f6 3.d3 e5 4.g3 ♗e7 5.♗g2
By transposition we have reached the above-mentioned variation
after 1.g3.
5…0-0 6.0-0
Dmitry Darmin, a young Russian FIDE Master, arranges his game in
the style of the King’s Indian Attack.
6…c6 7.c3 ♕c7 8.♕e2
The queen is not especially well placed here.
8.♘bd2 deserved preference.
8… ♖e8 9.h3 ♘bd7

In contrast, Robert Jamilov, an International Master who also plays
under the Russian flag, follows patterns from the Old Indian.
10.♘bd2
After 10.d4 ♗f8! the first player cannot hold the pawn duo e4/d4 for
long, since after …exd4 he has to recapture with the knight.
10…d5!
Now it is Black who is first to establish a central pawn duo, and with
it gets an easy initiative.
11.♔h2?!
This move does not help White’s game to any significant extent. A
pawn advance on the kingside is unrealistic in view of Black’s
pressure in the center. The tempo spent on the king move could
have been better utilized.
After 11.♖e1 ♗f8 12.♘f1 dxe4 13.dxe4 a5, too, Black’s pieces are
the better placed for the struggle on the queenside.
11…a5
Jamilov expands on the queenside.
12.♖e1
White does not have 12.a4 here, as in that case the black queen’s
bishop would come to the a6-f1 diagonal with 12…b6!.
12…♗f8

13.b3
The first player prepares to develop his queen’s bishop to b2.
With the withdrawal of the knight from d2, 13.♘f1, White hardly
gets a harmonious development: 13…dxe4 14.dxe4 ♘c5 15.♘h4 h6
 Black is already threatening …♗e6 followed by …♖fd8 and …
♘d3.
Better is 13.♕d1 a4 , although here too Black has pressure.
13…a4
Now White can keep the queenside closed. Better were 13…h6, 13…
♘c5, and 13…b5, in each case with a slight advantage to Black.
14.b4 b5 15.a3 dxe4
After the surrender of the central tension it should not be possible
for Black to expand his initiative, so White can now equalize. 15…
♗b7 was more natural.
16.dxe4?!
Now, however, the passive white knights are just getting in each
other’s way. Correct was 16.♘xe4 ♘xe4 17.♕xe4! ♗b7 18.♘g5
♘f6 19.♕e2 c5, with a level game.
16…♘b6  17.♗f1

17…c5!?
Since the b5-pawn cannot be taken, this advance guarantees the
second player a permanent space advantage on the queenside. The
position shows some similarities to Game 26, Andersson-Malaniuk
(Chapter 4), with colors reversed. Here Black has a space advantage
and the better development. In the game, Robert Jamilov succeeded
in building up his advantage and in the end decided the game in his
favor:
18.♗b2 ♗b7 19.♖ed1 ♗c6 20.♗g2 ♖ad8 21.♘e1 c4 22.♘f1 ♕b7 ≥ 22…

39.♔h3 ♕f5+
0-1
Conclusion
Against 1.g3 the game, after 1…e5 followed by …d7-d6 and …♗e7,
often goes into the English Opening or the Old Indian. If White
chooses a setup with d2-d3 and e2-e4, in the style of the King’s
Indian Attack, Black can follow familiar patterns with …♘f6, …0-0
and …c7-c6.
Game 49

Juan Toledano Llinares 2312
Jesus de la Villa Garcia 2478
Benasque 2012
1.f4
Bird’s Opening of course makes it difficult for Black to get his setup
with …d7-d6 and …e7-e5, or rather makes it just about impossible.
So, as the second exception to our 1…d6 repertoire, we choose to
fianchetto the king’s bishop. The first time around, after 1.d4 d6(!)
2.♗f4 g6, we felt we had an obligation to our book title and
employed …♗g7 to get in an early …e7-e5, giving a very familiar
central formation even with an unusual development of the king’s
bishop (see Game 37, Tran-Rambaldi, in Chapter 5). Here, however,
our reaction is somewhat more flexible: striving towards one and the
same standard build-up in every case has its limits. Let us rather
exploit the disadvantages of White’s development.
Against 1.g4, note the short ‘variation’ 1…d5 2.♗g2 c6 and go no
further. White has posed a problem for himself with the double-step
of the g-pawn. Black can look to see how White will come to its aid
and otherwise develop in a quite natural manner, with a keen eye for
the square weaknesses on f4 and h4 created by 1.g4.
1…g6!?

How would White like to develop his bishops? For the king’s bishop
there are two natural possibilities available, e2-e3 and ♗e2(d3, c4,
b5), depending on how Black arranges his pieces, or g2-g3 and
♗g2. For the queen’s bishop matters are rather worse. Already with
his first move White has permanently blocked the c1-g5 diagonal,
while the black bishop’s imminent arrival at g7 works against the
fianchetto of the white queen’s bishop. An important part of Black’s
development scheme is whether to answer e2-e4 with the counter-
thrust …d7-d5(!), giving a kind of Scandinavian with the extra moves
f2-f4 and …g7-g6, of which Black’s is the more useful.
2.e4
The International Master from Spain offers his countryman the
transition to a number of different lines, from the Pirc/Modern
Defense to the Sicilian, where the move f2-f4 offers the first player
some attacking chances. But the grandmaster declines to go into any
of these.
A) With 2.♘f3 White can for the moment put off having to decide
what to play. After 2…♗g7 there are various setups at his disposal:
A1) 3.♘c3 d5! 4.e3 ♘f6, and while Black can develop without
problems and harmoniously, White doesn’t have it so easy. If he
fianchettos the queen’s bishop, the play should proceed in a manner
similar to the 2.b3 variation (discussed below);
A2) 3.e4 d5! 4.e5 c5 5.c3 (5.d4 cxd4 6.♘xd4 ♘h6!?) 5…♘h6
6.d4 cxd4 7.cxd4 0-0 8.♗e2 ♘c6 9.0-0 ♗g4 10.♗e3 ♘f5 11.♗f2
e6 12.♘c3 h5. In this French formation Black has been able to post
his queen’s bishop actively outside the pawn chain. The pressure on
the d4-pawn and the fact that all the black pieces have good
squares at their disposal balance out White’s space advantage;
A3) 3.e3 ♘f6 (3…d6 4.d4!) 4.♗e2 0-0 5.0-0 d6!? 6.d4 c5  and
again the dark-squared queen’s bishop and the black queen’s knight
have more natural possibilities for their development, which we
cannot easily say for their white counterparts;
A4) After 3.g3 we could, with 3…d6 4.♗g2 e5, try for a familiar
central formation; e.g. 5.d3?! (≥ 5.fxe5 dxe5=) 5…exf4! 6.gxf4 d5!?
7.♘c3 (7.0-0 ♘e7) 7…d4 8.♘e4 ♘e7 9.0-0 0-0 10.c3 ♘bc6
11.cxd4?! (11.e3! dxe3 12.♗xe3 ♘f5 13.♗f2 ♖b8  …14…b6) 11…

♘xd4 12.♘xd4 ♕xd4+ 13.e3 ♕b6  0-1 (22) Kochetkov-Romanov,
Minsk 2015;
A5) 3.d3 can likewise be answered simply, e.g., with 3…d5 4.e4
dxe4 5.dxe4 ♕xd1+ 6.♔xd1=.
B) After the immediate fianchetto of the queen’s bishop it is White
who is the more likely to have difficulty getting good play for his
pieces; e.g. 2.b3 ♗g7 3.♘c3 d5 4.♗b2 ♘f6 5.e3 0-0 6.♘f3 c5
7.♗e2 ♘c6 8.0-0.
analysis diagram
The pawn chain d2-e3-f4 can be blown up with the lever 8…d4!:
9.♘a4 b6 10.♗b5 ♗b7 11.♗xc6 ♗xc6 12.exd4 cxd4 13.♘xd4
♗xa4 14.bxa4 ♘e4 15.c3N ♖c8  The second player’s sizable
positional advantage more than makes up for the minimal material
disadvantage.
Back to the game.

2…d5!
This is the idea! Black aims for central structures in which the move
f2-f4 is either not very useful, or bad.
3.♘c3
Toledano Llinares prefers an open center.
A) For the advance in the center with 3.e5, the double-step of the
f-pawn was counter-productive. 3…c5 4.c3 ♘h6N. A fine outpost on
f5 beckons to this knight. From there it cannot be easily driven away,
as an early g2-g4 would open the white king position too much.
Black plans …♗g7, …0-0 and …♘c6. If White plays an early d2-d4,
the d4-pawn comes under pressure after …cxd4, cxd4 with …♘f5
and …♕b6, analogous to the variation 2.♘f3 ♗g7 3.d5. Besides, …
d5-d4 followed by …♗c8-e6-d5 or …b7-b6 and …♗b7 can be
considered.
4…d4 is also playable: 5.♗d3 ♘h6 6.♗e4 ♗g7 7.d3 0-0 8.♘f3 ♔h8
9.♕b3 ♘c6= 0-1 (51) Nakamura-Grischuk, Stavanger blitz 2015;
B) After 3.exd5 ♕xd5 Black plays a better version of the
Scandinavian Defense – the move …g7-g6 here is more productive
than White’s f2-f4. If the queen is attacked, she can go back to d8
without any problem, and Black’s other pieces find good squares.
Worth noting here is the idea of developing the king’s knight to f6
via h6. Here are a few examples of possible development: 4.♘c3
♕d8 (4…♕a5; 4…♕d6) 5.♘f3 ♗g7 6.d4 ♘f6 (6…♘h6!? 7.♘e4!?

♘f5 8.c3∞) 7.♗c4 0-0 (7…♗g4? 8.♗xf7+!) 8.0-0 ♘bd7 (8…♗g4
9.♗e3; 8…♗f5!?; 8…♘c6)
3…dxe4 4.♘xe4 ♗g7 5.♘f3 ♘f6 6.♘xf6+
After 6.d3 c5 we have the same central structure as we see later.
6…♗xf6
In principle, 6…exf6?! is also a good idea. After the early …f6-f5 the
bishop exerts pressure against the queenside, usually in conjunction
with …c7-c5. Unfortunately, there is a tactical problem with this:
7.♕e2+ ♗e6 8.f5!∞, with a very unattractive tripled pawn on the f-
file.
7.g3?!
This allows the grandmaster a favorable central formation.
Better is 7.d4 c5 8.dxc5 ♕c7 9.c3 ♕xc5=.
7…c5 8.d3 ♘c6  9.♗g2 0-0 10.0-0
10…♗e6
Black builds up on the half-open d-file and tries to provoke c2-c3.
An interesting idea here was first to provoke h2-h3: 10…♗g4 11.h3
♗e6 12.♘g5 ♗d5 13.♘e4 ♗g7
11.♘g5
11.c3 ♕d7 (this move could be played after the interpolation 10…
♗g4 11.h3, with a gain of tempo) 12.♗e3 b6 .
11…♗d5 12.♘e4 ♗g7 13.c3 e6 14.♗e3

14.♘xc5 also would not ease Black’s game. After 14…♗xg2
15.♔xg2 ♕d5+ 16.♘e4 f5 17.c4 ♕d7  Black will recoup the pawn,
on d3: e.g., 18.♘g5 ♖ad8 19.♘f3 (19.♖e1? ♘b4!–+) 19…♕xd3
20.♕xd3 ♖xd3 .
14…b6 15.♕e2 ♕d7
Black has an enduring advantage. He can combine the pressure
down the d-file with action on both wings, in particular where the
open white kingside (after f2-f4) makes a negative impression. After
many vicissitudes, however, White won the game:
16.♖ad1 ♘a5 ≥ 16…♖ad8 17.b3 ≥ 17.h3 17…♖ad8 18.d4 c4 19.b4 ♘c6
20.♘d2 ♘e7 21.♖c1 ♘f5 22.♗f2 h5 23.h3  ♗xg2 23…♖a8!?; 23…♘d6;
23…♕a4 24.♘e4 24.♔xg2 ♕d5+ 24…♘d6 25.♕f3 ♕a4 (25…a5; 25…♖a8)
25.♕f3 ♘d6?! 26.a4!= f5 27.♖fe1 ♔f7 28.♖e2 ♗f6 29.♖ce1 ♖fe8
30.♖e3 ♖e7 31.♕xd5 exd5 32.♖xe7+ ♗xe7 33.♖e5 ♘e4 34.♘xe4 fxe4
35.f5 gxf5 36.♖xf5+ ♔g6 37.g4 hxg4 38.hxg4 ♗g5 39.♔f1 ♖d7 40.♗g3
a6 41.♔e2 b5 42.a5 ♗f6?! 42…♖f7=; 42…♖h7= 43.♗e5 43.♗f4!  43…
♗g5= 44.♖f8 ♖f7 45.♖g8+ ♔h6 46.♖a8 ♗h4 47.♖xa6+ ♔g5?? 47…
♔h7= 48.♗f6+!+– ♔xg4 49.♗xh4 ♔xh4 50.♖d6 ♖f3 51.♖xd5 ♖xc3
52.♖xb5 ♖a3 53.♖e5 ♖a4 54.♔e3 ♖xb4 55.♔xe4 ♖a4 56.♖c5 c3
57.♔e5 ♔g5 58.d5 c2 59.♖xc2 ♖xa5 60.♖g2+
1-0
Conclusion

Against 1.f4 it is hardly possible to achieve …d7-d6 and …e7-e5 by
simple means. The build-up with 1…g6 and (should White follow up
with e2-e4) …d7-d5! is, however, a good alternative. Black gets a
comfortable development, and at the same time White has problems
developing his queen’s bishop.

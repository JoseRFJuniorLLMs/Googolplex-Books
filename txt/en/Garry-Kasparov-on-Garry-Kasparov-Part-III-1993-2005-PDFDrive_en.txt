Foreword
This concluding volume of my autobiographical trilogy Garry Kasparov on Cany Kasparov 
contains one hundred of the most memorable games and endings played during the 12 
years after my withdrawal from FIDE (1993-2005), and also a selection of my best games 
from simultaneous displays with professionals, as well as from rapid and blitz tournaments.
As regards drama and the intensity of events, this last period of my career was not inferior 
to all its preceding stages taken together. Whereas earlier the graph of my tournament 
successes, with slight exceptions, invariably proceeded upwards, now it more resembled a 
sinusoid. There were various reasons for the slumps in my play, but the chief of these was the 
psychological discomfort caused by the almost constant opposition with FIDE.
After winning matches under the aegis of the Professional Chess Association (PCA), 
against Short (1993) and Anand (1995), I remained the ‘historic’ champion. But Karpov, after 
winning his match against Timman (1993) became the FIDE version of the champion and 
then, after defeating Kamsky (1996), he retained his title. The situation at the chess summit 
became complicated, and I even had to explain to the public: ‘I am the world champion. Not a 
version, but the chess world champion!’
The arguments should finally have been resolved by a unification match, envisaged in a 
declaration of cooperation between FIDE and the PCA. The guarantor of a sixth (!) Kasparov- 
Karpov match was the new FIDE president Kirsan llyumzhinov, who in August 1996 signed a 
preliminary agreement with the contestants. The chess world was on the verge of unifica­
tion. But instead of this, breaking with an historic tradition, llyumzhinov began staging mass 
world championships on a knock-out system.
Although at that time I won a number of notable tournaments, including Las Palmas 1996 
and Linares 1997, the time had come to again defend my title. After the collapse of the match 
with Karpov and the departure from chess of the powerful PCA sponsor - the Intel company 
- I was forced myself to find a worthy match opponent. In February 1998 Senor Rentero, the 
permanent organiser of the tournaments in Linares, came to the rescue. He suggested hold-
5

ing an Anand-Kramnik candidates match in the early summer, a world championship match 
in the autumn, and then setting up a full qualifying cycle. Alas, this plan was also wrecked. 
First Anand refused to play, and when his replacement Shirov defeated Kramnik, money 
could not be found for my match with Shirov...
But the intensive preparations for a world championship match were not wasted and led 
to a new upsurge in my play in 1999-2000. This period became the second peak of my career 
(the first, I should remind you, was in 1988-1990). I won six super-toumaments in succession 
and achieved the unprecedented rating of 2851 - despite rating inflation, this world record 
stood for 13 years.
Early in 2000 English organisers suggested holding a world championship match in the 
autumn between me and Anand. However, Vishy again declined (it would appear that our 
1995 match had traumatised him psychologically), and I chose the most difficult opponent - 
Kramnik, who shared victory with me in Linares 2000. Kramnik fully exploited this chance 
opportunity: by winning the match he became the 14th world champion.
After this I scored another four tournament victories, twice finishing ahead of Kramnik (I 
beat him in Astana 2001), and I established another world record - ten super-tournament 
victories in succession. In my view, Kramnik was morally obliged to sign an agreement to a 
return match. But apparently back in November 2000 he decided for himself: he would not 
play Kasparov again for the world championship!
Particular hopes were raised by a resolution to unite the chess world, signed on 6 May 
2002 in Prague by the FIDE president llyumzhinov together with the 13th and 14th champi­
ons. FIDE became the sole legal holder of the title of world champion and the only organisa­
tion that could hold official world championships, and in return it approved a unification 
plan, according to which Kramnik would play a match with the winner of a qualifying tour­
nament in Dortmund 2002, the FIDE knock-out world champion Ponomariov would play 
Kasparov, the No.l in the rating list, and ‘the winner of these two matches would meet in a 
unifying match for the world championship in October-November 2003’.
Alas, these efforts were in vain: first my match with Ponomariov collapsed, and then also 
with the next knock-out champion Kasimdzhanov. I was left in a suspended state and I lost 
two years of normal life. But llyumzhinov again showed that he keenly perceived the mood of 
the chess elite and officials, who did not want to give me a chance to regain the title. After 
losing my goal, I began seriously thinking about giving up professional chess. And I decided 
on this at the age of 41, after victories in the 2004 Russian Championship Super-Final and 
Linares 2005.
Since the times of the GMA I had been dreaming of organising tournament life and the 
world championship far more professionally than it is done by FIDE. But my attempts to 
unite the leading players failed because their sense of cooperative solidarity always receded 
in the face of internal disagreements. As a result, despite enormous efforts, I was not in fact 
able to repair the mistake of 1993.
I should like to express my gratitude to my long-standing trainer Alexander Shakarov, and 
also to the chess compilers Vladislav Novikov and Yakov Zusmanovich, for their help in prepar­
ing the manuscript for publication.

Chapter One
Short, Anand and Las Palmas
Match with Short
World Championship Match Kasparov - 
Short (London, 7 September - 21 October 
1993) - 12V2-TA.
On 23 March 1993 an abrupt zigzag in 
chess history occurred: the FIDE president 
Campomanes, after depriving me and Nigel 
Short of the rights of champion and chal­
lenger, announced the urgent staging of a 
match ‘for the world championship’ be­
tween the finalist and a semi-finalist of the 
previous qualifying cycle - Jan Timman and 
Anatoly Karpov.
Of the leading grandmasters, the only one 
who openly condemned this unprecedented 
decision was Vassily Ivanchuk: on 9 May he 
sent a letter to FIDE, in which he emphasised 
that he considered it unlawful to stage a 
match for the world title between Timman 
and Karpov, since in the qualifying cycle they 
had both lost their matches to Short, and in 
addition the other semi-finalist in the cycle - 
Yusupov, who had lost to Timman - had 
completely equal rights with Karpov. ‘The
loss of a match to Short should not give the 
right to participate in a match for the world 
championship or other privileges’, declared 
Ivanchuk, who suggested that the cham­
pion’s title should be left vacant and a new 
qualifying cycle held. The 12 winners of the 
July Interzonal Tournament in Biel should be 
joined by Karpov and Yusupov, and the 
seven winners of the matches between them 
should then by joined by Timman. However, 
as the press reported, ‘Ivanchuk's proposal 
was rejected by FIDE because it did not want 
to lose the money from the organisation of 
the Timman-Karpov match’.
Meanwhile it became known that in the 
autumn in London, under the aegis of the 
PCA and The Times newspaper, a Kasparov- 
Short match for the world title would be 
held, with a prize fund of 2V2 million dollars.
I began a period of purposeful preparation, 
in the course of which I played just four 
official games - for Auxerre in the French 
Club Championship (+2=2; May 1993).
For me this was a terribly difficult time: 
there was the war with FIDE, organizational
7

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
problems with the PCA, the future of which 
still looked very obscure, the split with the 
Russian Chess Federation, caused by the 
political crisis in the country, and serious 
family discords (in the end I separated from 
my first wife, and she and her parents with 
our daughter Polina left for the USA). It was 
impossible to invent a greater number of 
problems before a match. My nerves were on 
edge, and my mental state left much to be 
desired, but I believed that I would be able to 
beat Short, since the score in our previous 
meetings with the ‘classical’ time control 
was +10-1=4 in my favour.
The first lengthy training session took 
place in the summer on the Croatian coast, 
the first time I had been there (and after that 
I went there every year, trying to recreate the 
atmosphere 
of 
the 
irretrievably 
lost 
Zagulba). Apart from my mother, with me 
were my chief trainer Sergey Makarychev, 
Alexander Beliavsky, Zurab Azmaiparashvili 
and Alexander Shakarov - together with 
press attache Vladimir Dvorkovich, it was 
they who later comprised my team in Lon­
don, the first two being my official seconds. 
We worked quite productively, although the 
greater part of what we found in our open­
ing preparations came in useful to me only 
after the match.
With White it was planned to alternate l 
e4 and l  d4. After l  e4, of course, we studied 
both of Short’s favourite replies - l...e6 2 d4 
d5 (with the variation 3 £>c3 -&b4 4 e5 c5 5 
a3 .&.XC3+ 6 bxc3 and ^ 4 )  and l...e5 2 £>f3 
£>c6, after which both 3 -&b5 and 3 d4 were 
prepared. And after l  d4 we looked at the 
Queen’s Gambit and the Slav Defence, and 
less at the Nimzo-lndian, where I had my 
own preparations in the set-up with 4 Vic2 
(cf. Game No.4).
Fot Black, anticipating l  e4 and guided by 
the principle Heave well alone’, we analysed
only the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian 
Defence - but not those variations which 
occurred in the match! Here, unfortunately, I 
lacked flexibility, as also later in my 2000 
match with Kramnik, whereas in the 1995 
match with Anand I had in reserve the 
‘Dragon’, which came as an unpleasant 
surprise for my opponent (Game No.2l).
At the end of August, now at a training 
session in Podolsk on the outskirts of Mos­
cow, I looked a little at the French Defence 
with Lputian (cf. Game No.10), at the 7~Wb6 
variation in the Najdorf with Magerramov, 
and I met with Geller, who gave me a num­
ber of pieces of valuable opening advice - in 
particular, how to advantageously avoid the 
sharp Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez 
which was employed by Short (cf. Game 
No.2).
This match was splendidly organised and 
was even broadcast on TV. Therefore for the 
first time in the history of world champion­
ship matches the contestants played strictly 
three times a week, without any time-outs 
and with a six-hour time control: two hours 
for 40 moves and an hour for the next 20 
(followed by an adjournment, but things did 
not come to that). Also for the first time, 
immediately after a game the players were 
obliged to give a short press conference 
(although the loser had the right not to take 
part). The chief arbiters were Yuri Averbakh 
(Russia) and Carlos Falcon (Spain).
We played in the Savoy Theatre, and my 
team and I lived ten minutes’ drive from 
there - in a house on Chester Terrace, close 
to Regent’s Park. The opening ceremony and 
the drawing of lots, together with a charity 
lunch, took place in the restaurant adjoining 
the theatre, Simpson’s-in-the-StTand, where 
in 1851 the first international tournament 
in the history of chess was played. Within 
these walls Morphy, Steinitz, Chigorin,
8

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine all per­
formed... It was here that the famous ‘im­
mortal’ Anderssen-Kieseritzky game was 
played, and 142 years later it was repro­
duced by grandmasters Keene and Speel- 
man, robed in 19th century costumes (the 
former was one of the match organisers, and 
the latter, along with Kavalek, the chal­
lenger’s official second).
In the first game I drew the white pieces. 
The symbolic first move in the match - 1 e4 
- was made by Peter Stothard, the editor-in- 
chief of The Times. Then he pressed the clock 
button with his palm, and the game began. 
Short chose l...e5, immediately threatening 
the Marshall Attack. After replying as ad­
vised by Geller - 8 a4 (cf. Game No.2, note to 
Black’s 8th move), gradually I completely 
outplayed my opponent, but in a time 
scramble, with more time on my clock, I 
missed a win on the 35th and 36th moves. 
The position became equal, but Black was a 
pawn up, and to be on the safe side I offered 
a draw on the 38th move. In the heat of the 
moment Short declined - and a move later 
he lost on time! This dramatic start greatly 
influenced the further course of the match - 
it was not without reason that at the end I 
was presented with two elegant chairs, 
white and black, on the backs of which were 
carved the final position from the first game.
In the second game Short played 6 JLgS 
against the Najdorf Variation, and to start 
with I employed a bit of cunning - I trans­
posed into a comparatively rare variation of 
the Rauzer Attack (cf. Game No.l, note to 
Black’s 6th move), confidently neutralised 
my opponent’s slight initiative and in a 
sharp time-trouble battle I gained a draw. I 
could have done with more such cunning in 
the 2000 match with Kramnik.
The third game was again an ‘anti- 
Marshall’, again I managed to outplay my
opponent (cf. Game No.2, note to Black's 9th 
move), and again I blundered in his time- 
trouble - I missed a win on the 27th move, 
allowing Black equalizing counterplay, and 
Short almost saved himself, but he stumbled 
on the 3lst move and after desperate resis­
tance he nevertheless lost.
The score became iVi-Vi in my favour. But 
Short, seeing that I was also making mis­
takes, did not become depressed and was 
hoping to pull one back in the very next 
game.

After this game Nigel was to switch exclu­

killing all my preparations for his usual 6

Of course, I had analysed more and was

I had never been afraid of 9 ®b3.

As is well known, if ll...h5 12 0-0 £sc6 
(Spassky-Fischer, 11th match game, Reykja­

However, I2...£sd7l is quite acceptable: 13

13.. .h5
Although 13...Sc8 is also undeaT, I pre­
ferred to obtain a key position from the 
Spassky-Fischer game with which I was very 
familiar. But here Short surprised me.

At the centre of attention then was 14 
<£sbl (Spassky) or 14 #e3 (Tal), for which I 
had prepared. The old idea 14 £sdl is also 
logical: after removing his knight from the 
vulnerable square c3, White prepares either 
the cramping c2-c4, or c2<3 and £se3<4.
14.. .5.8
This natural continuation turned out to 
be new, and since then it has become the 
main move. 14...#b4 is worse because of 15 
c3 or 15 #e3 (Platonov-Bukhover, Kiev 1963). 
But 14-..h4l? with the threat of ...h4-h3, 
which I wTongly critidsed in Informator, 
deserves consideration.

15.. .#b4 16 c3
An instantaneous reply - the sacrifice of a 
second pawn! In Informator I suggested 16 
#d3(?), overlooking the unexpected trick
16.. .£se5! 17 fxe5 2c3, when Black regains 
the piece with advantage (18 #d2 Sxb3l).

After the immediate 17 £)c4l? I consid­
ered two possibilities:

for the exchange;
2) 17~.£ld8 18 £)d4 (18 £)b6 Wc61, main­
taining the balance) l8...Wg6 (Ftacnik’s 
move l8...Sc7 is also suitable, or l8...h4, 
Kotronias-Sasikiran, Moscow 2004) 19 ^.d3?! 
(19 £sb6 is better) I9...f5 20 Sael, and my

forced a draw (Gulko-Psakhis, Beer Sheva 
1993). ‘After thinking for 24 minutes, Short 
decided to play on. One can understand him: 
after a poor start he desperately needed a 
win.’ (Averbakh).
20.. .£se7!
A strong reply. If 20...iLe7?, then 21 £)c4

decisive (but not 23 cxb4? d5), but now Black

A serious loss of time. Fearing ...£le7-f5, 
Short provokes ...f6-f5, but this will merely be 
to the advantage of the bishop on g7. 23

complicated, unclear play in prospect.

have developed to Black’s obvious advantage

Sd5l! 41 £>xb7 (41 fxg6 Sxc5) 4l..#xb7 42 
fxg6 f5 43 #e6+ &g7, and White is lost.
37.. .#c2! (the only way!) 38 f5 Sc3 39 #g4? 
Once again in time-trouble, Short failed to
find the more resilient defence 39 £id4 - 
after 39...#e4+ 40 #g2 #xg2+ 41 <&xg2 £ie5 
I would still have had to work hard to con­
vert my extra pawn.

The score increased to 3'A-'A, and the 
outcome was practically decided. On one 
occasion in such a situation Smyslov man­
aged to save a match with Botvinnik (1954), 
but now there were different times and 
different opponents. Although Short had

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
accomplished a competitive feat, by defeat­
ing Speelman, Gelfand, Karpov and Timman 
in the candidates cycle, in the world cham­
pionship match he encountered a different 
level of resistance, became anxious, began 
getting into time-trouble and making blun­
ders, as I once did in my first match with 
Karpov (1984/85).
I remember that, when Patrick Wolff ar­
rived in London after the fourth game, he 
said to me: ‘Well, that’s it, the match is over. 
Now we will work on finding a more worthy 
opponent for you next time.’ He had already 
begun helping Vishy Anand, who many 
regarded as the favourite in the forthcoming 
cycle.
However, Short had not given up hope, 
sensing that I was psychologically unpre­
pared for a difficult battle. In the fifth game 
for the sake of variety I played 1 d4, but on 
encountering a novelty in the Nimzo-lndian 
Defence I did not find the strongest con­
tinuation and had to be satisfied with a 
quick draw (cf. Came N0.4, note to White's 
llth  move). Nigel was very satisfied at 
having solved all his problems in 11 minutes, 
whereas on my 18 moves I spent 1 hour, 29 
minutes!
Short also demonstrated the quality of his 
opening preparation in the sixth game, in 
which he sprung a fresh surprise on me - for 
the first time he played 6 i.c4 e6 7 i-b3 
against the Najdorf. Before the match we 
had not looked at it at all! After some 
thought, I replied 7-.£»bd7, achieved a good 
game (cf. Game No.3, note to White’s 9th 
move), but I went wrong and Black’s position 
became dangerous. My opponent attacked 
fiercely and gave up a piece, but could only 
obtain perpetual check.
The score became 
In the seventh
game I again varied my opening move - and 
with success!

One of two recommendations by Geller. I

against Kamsky (Dos Hermanas 1996),

A popular reply, although nowadays 8...b4 
is deemed best. In the topsy-turvy first game 
after 9 d3 d6 10 a5 &e6 11 £ibd2 Sb8 12

path.
10 £bd2!?
Earlier 10 £ ic3 was preferred, for example:

14 
iLc8 15 ®e3 iLe6 with equality 
(Anand-Short, Amsterdam 1992). But Geller 
advised me to play my knight to fl and 
demonstrated a couple of key variations.
The most surprising thing is that with the 
8 a4 plan I scored 3 out of 3 and effectively 
won the match, although my entire prepara­
tion was largely based on the directive of the 
venerable grandmaster: ‘You should play 
£)bd2!’. But it was during the course of the 
match that I had to delve into the subtleties 
of this set-up. Indeed, from c3 all the same 
the knight has to move (after ...bs-b4) to e2 
and then to g3, whereas after £)bd2-fl it can 
go to both g3 and e3. In addition, on fl the 
knight does not hinder White so much as it 
does on e2, and there is the useful develop­
ing move ^.d2l. Subsequent practice con­
firmed that Geller was strategically correct.
I0...£)d7
A rare move, with the idea of ...£ic5. I was 
not concerned by 10...2e8 11 £)fl h6 12 JLd2

Quickly and confidently played: the

tactical trick 17...£xd4! 18 Sxe7 £ce6!, soon 
forcing Sxe6, gives Black a rook and a pawn 
for two minor pieces and quite good draw­
ing chances.
Here, for the first time in the game, I 
thought for a long time, choosing between 
two possibilities.

Only this is a novelty. If 15 £>fl Short

I5~£>d7 was more passive, although, in 
Averbakh’s opinion, Black would have had a 
‘typical defensive position and chances of 
gradually equalizing’.

game.
16.. .1.b7?!
A turning-point. Now I6...£ie7?! was 
weaker in view of 17 £>e3 or 17 d4l?. ‘The 
bishop is doing nothing on the a8-hl diago­
nal, and Short intends to find a new future 
for it’ (Averbakh). But he misses the last 
chance for the relieving advance in the 
centre - I6...d5l? 17 exd5 WxdS 18 £ie3 ^ 8  
19 £g4! (19 £>d2 g6! and ,.JLg7 is equal)
19.. .e4l 20 £sxf6+ 1fxf6 21 dxe4 Vixc3, and 
although after 22 2e3 or 22 .&d2 White has 
a small advantage, it is difficult for him to 
prevent ...c7-c5 and the exchange of the 
valuable b4-pawn.
17 £*3 g6 18 i.b3 i.g7
Nigel probably did not see any particular 
dangers for Black. After all, for the moment 
White is manoeuvring only in his half of the 
board, in the spirit of the classic Steinitz- 
Chigorin game (Game No.25 in Part I of My 
Great Predecessors).

An unnecessary move, since the active 
...f7-f5 merely aggravates Black’s problems.
20.. .£se7 (Ftacnik) should have been pre­
ferred.
21 £sd5
In Informator I condemned 21 g3(!?) be­
cause of 21...f5 22 hxg6 f4! ‘with an attack’, 
but this is an illusion: after 23 £sds! hxg6 24 
4g2 or 23~.£se7 24 £sxe7 Wxey 25 4g2 
thanks to the open h-file it is White who is 
attacking.
21.. .g5
Black weakens his kingside still further, 
but he already had a difficult choice:
21.. .gxh5?! 22 g3! followed by £sh4 or 4g2 
and Shi was bad for him, as was 21...£sf4?!
22 £sxf4 exf4 23 i.xf4 i.xc3 24 i.g5! f6 
(24.~i.f6 25 i.h6) 25 i.d2 with a powerful 
attack.
22 £se3l £sf4 23 gB
At the cost of a temporary pawn sacrifice, 
White invades with his knight on f5. How­
ever, the cool-headed 23 £sh2l? (Stohl)
deserved consideration.
23.. .£sxh5 24 £sf5
‘In the press centre 24 4g2!? g4 25 £sh2 
was also analysed, no satisfactory defence 
for Black being found’ (Averbakh). 24 i.d5l? 
looked no less tempting. But the game 
continuation seemed more promising to me: 
for the f5-knight the opponent is forced to 
give up his important bishop, return the 
pawn and go on to the defensive.
24.~i.xf5 25 exf5 Wd7
The alternative was 25~.£sf6 26 i.xg5 h6 
27 i.h4 V/d7, when there is not the reply 
£sh4 (cf. the note to Black’s 26th move). In 
Informator I gave the continuation 28 d4 
exd4 29 £sxd4 £sxd4 30 cxd4 with the idea of
30.. .11fxf5? 31 i.c2 and wins, but after
30.. .5e8! White has only a slight advantage. 
Therefore 28 i.c2l is better, for example:
28.. .1fxf5 29 d4 Wg4 30 i.xf6 i.xf6 31 1^3 
1^6 32 #e2 #g4 33 4g2 or 28...Se8 29 £sd2 
d5 30 i.b3, retaining a persistent initiative, 
although all the play still lies ahead..
26 i.xg5
A natural developing move (in contrast to
26 £sxg5 £sf6), which also has a tactical 
point: 26...1i fxf5? is not possible because of
27 i.d5l h6 (after 27...1fd7 28 £sh4 £sf6 29

Short...
26.. .H6?
At the most inappropriate moment!
26.. .d5? was also weak in view of 27 4^2 
with the threat of Shi. The only defence was
26.. .£yf6, to which I would have replied 27 
£ih4 or 27 Ac2 with an advantage (but alas, 
by no means the sort of advantage I had 
been hoping for).
27 £>h4?!
Too slow. After the game I pointed out the 
more accurate 27 l4>g2!? and Shi, for exam­
ple: 27...1rxf5 28 Shi Wg6 29 Ad5 £>b8(d8) 
30 £>xe5! or 29...hxg5 30 £>xg5 Ah6 31 #xh5 
with a clear advantage.
But a sudden tactical stroke, not men­
tioned by any of the commentators, was even 
stronger: 27 Axh6! Axh6 28 £ixe5! dxe5 29

The wrong route! ‘The world champion 
also criticised this move, pointing out that 
30 £rf3 was better, with a big advantage’ 
(Averbakh). Thus if 30...£\e7, then 31 g4 4^7 
32 Se3! We8 33 d4 is good (Stohl). However, 
the knight could also have jumped forward - 
30 £>g6! Sg8 (30...Se8 31 4 >g2 and Shi) 31

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
The decisive error: Black captures a poi­
soned pawn! After 33„JLg5 he could have 
defended successfully: 34 f4 ii-f6 35 fldl c6 
or 34 ^ 3  ^.xe3 35 Sxe3 £)f6 (as in the 
variation with 3i....&g5!?).

34.. .^g7 35 £)xh6! i.f6 (or 35-^xh6 36 
#g5+ &h7 37 .&C2!) 36 ^.xf7!
The final stroke. Black resigned (1-0).
A very nervy game and in its way a typical 
one: Short regularly ‘cracked’ in the time- 
troubles that pursued him. Nevertheless, at 
the end of this clash he declared: 'For the first 
time in the match Kasparov won thanks to 
his own strong play, and not my blunders.' 
And the press commented on the pretty 
finish: 'Garry, not suspecting that Princess 
Diana was present in the royal box, produced 
a truly royal game’.
The score rose to SVi-iyi. In the eighth 
game, to his credit, Nigel did not lose heart 
and continued fighting in the fearless man­
ner of the 19th century.

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
9...dxe5
Analyzing this game, I came to the con­
clusion that 9...£)fd7!? was even better - this 
is an idea which also occurs in other varia­
tions of the Sicilian. Now White cannot 
defend his e5-pawn with Af4, but after 10 
exd6 £)f6 and ...Axd6 Black has a comfort­
able game. I was intending to play this in the 
tenth game, but Short changed course.
10 fxe5 £)fd7 11 i.f4 b5
At one time I discussed this variation with 
Magerramov, and Black's flexible position 
very much appealed to me: he has no prob­
lems with his development, and the knight 
on c5 both defends the e6-pawn and keeps 
the b3-bishop under fire. White has to act 
energetically.
12 Wg4
12 We2 Ab7 13 0-0-0 is more solid (an ex­
ample: Topalov-Anand, Wijk aan Zee 1996).
12.. .h5!
A strong novelty, disrupting the smooth 
course of events. I advanced the pawn with 
pleasure, anticipating interesting complica­
tions. After 12...^b6? 13 0-0-0 (Zapolskis- 
Tataev, Stare Mesto 1992) or 13 AgS Wc7 14 
0-0-0 White has a powerful attack, but
12.. .£)f6 13 exf6 Wxd4 (Zapolskis) or
12.. JLb7l? (Hiibner, Mikhalchishin) is per­
fectly acceptable.
13 % 3 h4 14 Wg4 g5l?
‘Short expressed unconcealed astonish­
ment regarding this sharp move, on which 
Kasparov thought for 40 minutes!’ (Aver­
bakh). Later Short, Mikhalchishin and Ftacnik 
all suggested 14...h3, but after 15 g3 this is 
more likely to favour White.
On the other hand, Internet practice of 
the 2000s indicated a less eccentric way to 
equalise: 14—^f6! 15 exf6 Wxd4 16 fxg7 
1i rxg7 17 We2 JLe7, etc. This is similar to the
12...£)f6 continuation, except that the h7- 
pawn is now on h4, which hinders Black’s 
...0-0, but gives him counterplay with ...Ab7 
and ...h4-h3.
15 0-0-0!
In the best traditions of gambit chess! In 
the press conference after the game Nigel 
said: ‘Of course, this is the only way to play! I 
was taught that in the opening you have to 
develop your pieces, but the opponent didn’t 
develop his, and I had to punish him.’ Be­
sides, White had no choice: 15 Axg5? £)xe5 
or 15 Wxg5? Wxg5 16 Axg5 Jtb7 was weak, 
as well as 15 £)xe6?l fxe6 16 Axe6 £)b6! 17

find the correct defence. Immediately after­

(Mikhalchishin).

With his flag about to fall, Short also fal­
tered. He could have won with 38 jk.d4! - a 
flamboyant and also far from obvious move. 
The h2-pawn is given up with check, but the 
white king hides from the pursuit: 38...#hl+

But now his king is trapped.

That day Nigel played excellently, and for 
the first time in the match I found myself on 
the verge of defeat. But two errors by the 
opponent (24 Sxf7+ and 38 &.e5) allowed 
me to save the game.
In the ninth game I again changed my 
opening move, for which I now had good 
reasons: after the opening embarrassment 
in the fifth game, order had to be restored in 
the Nimzo-lndian!

Later S-WxdS became fashionable, with 
the idea of 6 <£>f3 #f5! or 6 e3 c5, as was 
played against me by Nikolic (Moscow

New York 1995; Frankfurt (rapid) 1999) and 
Kramnik (l8th match game, Moscow (blitz) 
1998; Linares 1999; 2nd match game, Mos­
cow (rapid) 2001). In the set-up with 5...exd5 
I already had several wins and a number of 
fresh ideas.

Part II of Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov) 
8 dxc5 g5 9 iLg3 £se4
After weakening his pawns in the centre 
and on the kingside, Black immediately 
attacks the c3-point. White can parry the 
threats in one of two ways: either launch a 
counter-attack, even at the cost of material 
sacrifices, seeing as the black king is poorly 
covered, or exchange Black’s active pieces 
and exploit his pawn weaknesses in the 
endgame. The variations of both plans are 
closely interwoven in the calculations, and in 
avoiding the first one can end up in the 
second, and vice versa. In the present game 
White carhes out the second plan, the 
overall drawback to which is that the great 
simplification often ends in a draw.

A novelty from the fifth game, which be­
came the main line. The usual I0...£)c6 l l

24 ^b4 ^d4! with a slightly inferior, but 
tenable endgame (Kasparov-Timman, Nov­
gorod 1995).
12 Jte5!
This was my new idea. When I showed it to 
my trainers they only frowned, but the more 
we looked at the variations, the more we liked 
White’s position. At any event, in practice this 
is more dangerous for Black than 12 iLxb8 
2xb8 13 £sd4 &d7! 14 £sb3 &xc3+ 15 bxc3 
Wxc3+16 Wxc3 ^xc3 with equality (I.Sokolov- 
van Wely, Wijk aan Zee 2005).
Here Short thought for 42 minutes... After 
the game he admitted that this was a critical 
moment for him. Unexpectedly Black faced 
difficult problems.
12...0-0
Again the most natural reply. I2...£sxc3? 
13 ®xf5 £se4+ 14 £sc3! 0-0 15 A.d3 (Karpov-

15 ^.xh8 £se416 a3 ixc3+ 17 ,&xc3 £sxc3 18 
®d2 are both bad for Black.
And after 12...f6, suggested by me in In- 
formator, 13 ixb8! 2xb8 14 £sd4 is now 
more effective, exploiting the weakness of 
the light squares: 14...£sxc3? 15 WxfS ^e4+ 
16 <^>e2! and wins (V.Popov-Loginov, Kazan 
2001) or 14..Jth7 (I4...1.d7 15 &d3 or 15 
JLe2) 15 ^.d3, when 15...£sxc3?! is dubious in 
view of 16 itxg6+ (16 0-0!?) I6...‘&>e7 
(l6...^f8? 17 0-0 £se4 18 ,&,xh7 Sxh7 19 f3 
and wins - S.lvanov) 17 0-0! £se4 18 ixh7 
2xh7 19 a3, regaining the piece and retain­
ing a persistent initiative, and therefore 
Black has to reconcile himself to a depress­
ing endgame after l5..Jb<c3+ 16 bxc3 
Wxc3+ 17 Wxc3 £ sxc3 18 <&d2 l.xd3 19 
<&xc3.
13 £sd4 iLg6?
Also a seemingly natural move, but on 
this occasion a poor one! The bishop could 
have been left en prise, and in more than one 
way:
1) 13...£sd7 14 £ixf5 £sxe5 15 £se7+ &g7 
16 £sxd5 itxc3+ 17 bxc3 2ad8 18 Sdl £sf6

1 ^X03+ 21 Wd2 Wxd2+ 22 <&xd2 2d8+ 23 <&>c3 
<^>xf6 White cannot hold on to his extra 
material) 20...‘&’xf6 21 JLe2 WxcS with good 
compensation for the pawn (Kotanjian- 
Khalifman, Budva 2009), but 15 id3!? is 
stronger (our analysis, tested in 2003);
2) I3...2e8 - to me this seemed the safest: 
now little is promised by 14 £sxf5 2xe5 15 
£sxh6+ >4^7 16 £sg4 2e8(e7, e6), or 14 Jb<b8 
£sxc3 (I4...ig6 15 id 3  2axb8 16 0-0 WxcS is 
also possible, Atalik-Short, Sarajevo 2003) 15 
£sxf5 ^e4+16 4>dl 2axb8 with equality;
3) I 3...^xc3 (the sharpest line) 14 £sxfs 
(14 ®xf5 <^e4+ 15 4>dl £sc6! or 15 4>e2 
2e8!? is extremely risky) 14...£se4+ 15 ^ d l 
£sc6 16 id 6  jte l 17 £ixh6+ 4>h8! or
16..JLxc5, also with a roughly equal game 
(Bareev-Carlsen, Khanty-Mansiysk 2005).
However, the battles in this unusual set-
23

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
up are continuing, and I would not hurry to 
make any final assessments.
14 ®b3! (the point of my idea) 14...®xc3 
Short seeks salvation in an inferior end­
game, and this is better than 14...£ixc5?! 15 
#xg6+ fxg6 16 ®xa5 .&xa5 17 Edl or the 
attempt to keep the queens on - I4...1i rd8 (or
14.. .1.a4 15 ^.d3) 15 &d3 4k6(d7) 16 i.d4, 
when Black has no real compensation for the 
pawn.
15 ^.xc3! (15 £ixa5?! £ia4+!) 15..~&xc2 16 
®xa5 i.xc3+ 17 bxc3 (the threat of ®xb7 
helps White to exchange the weak c5-pawn)
17.. .b6 18 &d2!?
It would appear that this intermediate 
move was underestimated by Nigel, who 
was more expecting 18 4k)3 bxc5 (after
18.. JLxb3? 19 axb3 bxc5 20 0-0-0! 2d8 21 
JLc4 Black again loses material) 19 ®xc5 Sc8 
20 Eel lxc5 21 Exc2 ®d7 22 4)d2 Sb8 with 
chances of defending a pawn down.
18.. .bxa5?
After this Black’s pawns are depreciated 
and he can no longer calmly capture on c5. 
His problems would also have increased 
after l8..JLa4?l 19 ®b3! ®d7 (l9-i.xb3? 20 
axb3 bxc5 21 h4! is even worse) 20 cxb6 
axb6 21 £)d4. But l8..Jtg6 19 cxb6 axb6 20 
4}b3 £)d7 was more resilient.
19 &xc2 Ec8
Essentially the only move: Edl was 
threatened, and if 19...4kl7? then 20 c6 4k 5 
(20...4k)6? 21 iLa6! and wins) 21 h4l, break­
ing up the opponent’s kingside and not 
forgetting about the threat of EdlxdS.
20 h4!
An energetic reply, and the culmination of 
our analysis. ‘White is a pawn up, Black’s 
pawn structure is weakened, and the white 
bishop is stronger than the knight - all this 
heralds an easy win for the world champion’ 
(Averbakh).
20.. .®d7
Things are hopeless after 20...Sxc5 21 
hxg5 hxg5 22 Eh5 f6 23 i.d3 ®d7 24 Shi 
<Af7 25 Sh7+ &e6 26 g4 with the threat of

also has a big advantage after 20...g4 21 &e2 
g3 22 fxg3 Sxc5 23 Sabi ®d7 24 Sb5 and

36 &g4 or 35...&xh6 36 Sg4l. But, assuming 
that White could win as he pleased, I de­
cided simply to exchange the h6-pawn foT 
the a7-pawn and to remain with two extra 
passed pawns (and with the black knight 
stranded on hi). Tormented by the question 
of why Short wasn’t resigning, I gradually 
stopped understanding anything...

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
If I had cooled down slightly and stopped 
to think, I would have played 43 a4l, since 
after 43-2xd5 (43~.£>f2 44 a5l) 44 2xd5+ 
*xd5 45 e4+ we have a classic case of the 
black king being unable to stop both pawns. 
43—2xd5 44 a4 2a5 45 2al (this is also an 
inaccuracy - 45 2h4l was correct) 45—*e5
46 e4??
A complete black-out - a dreadful mis­
take, reflecting the state of my nervous 
system in this match. Any waiting move 
followed by the switching of the rook to the 
fourth rank and the advance of the pawns 
would have won, for example: 46 2a2 *f5
47 e4+ *e5 48 *e3 *d6 (48...2a8 49 a5) 49 
*d4 *c6 (49...‘&e6 50 *c4 and *b4) 50 
2 c2+ and 2c4.
46...*e6??
Again a typical situation: the opponent 
immediately returns the favour! There was a 
draw by 46...2c5! 47 2a3 2c4 48 a5 2xe4 49 
a6 2f4+ 50 *e3 2f8 or 47 a5 2c3+ 48 *g4

*f5 *04 53 *e6 *>b4 54 2 a l *>c5 55 *d7 
*>b6 56 2bl+ *c5! 57 2b7 2h81. ‘This posi­
tion is in all the endgame guides, including a 
book recently published by Batsford, one of its 
co-authors being Speelman, one of Short’s 
seconds! But apparently the challenger was 
already reconciled to defeat’ (Averbakh).
47 *e3 (now the march of the pawns is 
unavoidable) 47...*d6 48 *d4 *d7 49 *c4 
*c6 50 *b4 Se5 512cl+ *b6 52 2c41-0
Although not without its mistakes, this 
was a very interesting game. Psychologically 
it set the seal on the match: the score be­
came 7-2, or 5-0 with four draws. Short 
found himself in an even worse situation 
than I did in my first match with Karpov 
(1984/85): in that match the winner was to 
be the first to win six games, not counting 
draws, whereas in this one each draw 
brought the leader closer to his goal. Never­
theless, the subsequent struggle in the 
match was quite tense, and I had to solve 
numerous problems.
Already in the tenth game Short was 
closer than ever to a win, although he chose 
an incorrect opening variation (cf. Game 
No.3, note to White’s 9th move). After my 
error on the 14th move he flamboyantly 
sacrificed his queen and developed a dan­
gerous initiative, and after 28...1i rxh2? 29 
£sc6 he obtained an absolutely won position, 
but in his usual desperate time-trouble he 
allowed me to escape in what turned out to 
be one of the most fascinating games of the 
match. When he was signing the score- 
sheets, Nigel could hardly hold back the 
tears...
In the 11th game I played the Scotch 
Game for the first time, employed an inter­
esting novelty and reached an obviously 
better endgame (cf. Game No.14, note to 
Black’s 10th move), but then I squandered 
my advantage, almost overstepped the 
mark, and after adventures reached the 
haven of a draw.
Also typical of the entire match was the 
fighting 12th game, where an unusual 
position with a disrupted material balance 
occurred.

first removes his bishop with gain of tempo. 
After 12 a3 -&b7 13 0-0-0 (Istratescu-Buturin,

It transpires that if I8...'i,xh4? there is the 
ambush 
19 Wf2l, 
and after 
19...#67 
(I9.~i.xe4?? 20 Sxg6+ or 19~1Srxf4? 20 £lf6+ 
is bad) 20 £>c3 Black does not have sufficient 
compensation for the piece. And if I8...ffd4?! 
there follows 19 £if6+ 4>g7 20 c3l (it is hard 
for a human to find such an idea!) 20...Srd8 
21 £*4! Wxh4 22 #f2! #xf4 (22...«e7? 23

After l8..JLxe4 19 lfxe4 #xh4 20 IfxeS 
White also puts his trust in the strength of 
his bishop (20...lfxh2?! 21 f5l).
The thematic I8...f5 19 Jixe6+ 4h8 20 h5 
ji.xe4 is slightly better - Black regains the

an endgame: 22...'i,d4! 23 lfxd4 exd4 24 
0-0-0 with an extTa pawn, but still by no 
means a win.
The variations examined suggest that it is 
useful to include I8...a5!, for example:

thanks to the liveliness of the h- and g- 
pawns Black has real chances of a draw.
In any event, after 18 Sg3 I could have 
encountered serious problems, whereas now 
I gained full compensation for the piece.
I8...£.xe4 19 Wxe4 l rxh4+ 20 &e2

I thought for 35 minutes here - 1 also stud­
ied the more aggressive 20...a5!? or 20...exf4!? 
(aiming to keep the queens on), but I pre­
ferred to go into an unusual endgame with 
an imposing mass of passed pawns.
21 Sg2 «xf4 (21...IK15+ 22 «f3 «f5 23 Bg5 
Hfxf4 24 Hfxf4 exf4 would have led to 
roughly the same thing) 22 Wxf4 exf4 23 
&f3 Sfd8
‘To avoid allowing the white rook into his
position, Black gives up his f4-pawn’ (Aver­
bakh). ‘With this balance of forces the ex­
change of one pair of rooks is very useful’ 
(Mikhalchishin).
However, here also it was appropriate to 
include 23-.a5!?, since after 24 a3 a4 25 -&a2 
2fd8 26 2xd8+ 2xd8 27 '4’xf4 '4>g7 it is more 
difficult for White to create a mobile passed 
pawn, and the continuation recommended 
by me in Informator - 24 c3 a4 25 &.c2 e5 26 
2d5! f6 27 a3 ‘with advantage to White’ in 
reality involves a considerable risk for him:
27.. .2fd8 28 2gd2?! (28 Bc5 is equal)
28.. .Bxd5 29 2xd5 '4,g7 30 JLd3?! h5!, and 
the black pawn avalanche becomes irresisti­
ble (31 2xb5 2xb5 32 jLxb5 g5! and 33 .g4+ 
with a pretty win - the pawns promote 
without the aid of the king!).
24 2xd8+ 2xd8 25 ^xf4 &f8
Bringing the king closer to White’s poten­
tial passed pawn. Again 25...a5!? deserved 
consideration. 25...‘&g7 would also have 
done - this looked dangerous because of 26 
^e5, but here also 26...a5 is quite sufficient, 
for example: 27 c4 a4 28 jLc2 bxc4 29 -&xa4 
2d5+ 30 ^f4 2f5+ and 2a5! or 27 a4 bxa4 28

because of 31 Sg4l.

The mutual exhaustion of the forces 
could have resulted after 31 Af3 h3 32 Sh2

it is blockaded by the king) 34 c6 (34 b4

it is hard for White to achieve even the

The score became 8V2-3V2. After making a

scored a sixth win, and had it been an 
unlimited match it would have become the 
shortest in history. But here ‘on my last legs’ 
a further five games had to be played. In the 
16th Nigel finally scored a consolation goal, 
and the remaining games, also by no means 
peaceful, ended in draws.
The match result ll'h-T h speaks for it­
self, but Short was proud of the 5-5 score in 
the last ten games and said that he was 
confident about the future. However, the 
score in our subsequent ‘classical’ encoun­
ters was +5=9; not in his favour...
Soon Karpov won the ‘match of the un­
derstudies’ against Timman (l21/2-81/2), and 
for the first time in the entire history of 
world championships there was a duumvi­
rate at the chess summit: my historic title 
was opposed by the official one.

On returning to Moscow from a lengthy 
tour of South America prior to the New Year, 
I promptly plunged into the maelstrom of 
chess life and began preparing for the new 
season - not only as a player, but also as an 
organiser. The contesting of the world 
championship between 1993 and 1995 was 
undoubtedly the most tense and unusual in 
chess history. The challengers fought simul­
taneously in two series, to qualify via the 
PCA line for a match with me, and via the 
FIDE line for a match with Karpov, although 
for greater legitimacy he was obliged to join 
in at the semi-final stage.
An enormous achievement of the Profes­
sional Chess Association was the two-year 
contract with the Intel Corporation, which 
became the main PCA sponsor. This enabled 
us to stage both an unprecedented series of 
rapid-play knock-out tournaments, the 
Intel World Chess Grand Prix (Moscow - 
New York - London - Paris), and also a 
number of classical chess super-tourna­
ments, but above all - a complete world 
championship cycle. Our qualifying tour­
nament (Groningen, December 1993) was 
an unprecedentedly strong ‘Swiss’, and the 
prize fund here was three times greater 
than at the FIDE Interzonal Tournament 
(Biel, July 1993). The favourites in both 
cycles were the now experienced Anand 
and the rapidly improving Kamsky and 
Kramnik (Ivanchuk did not qualify for the 
Candidates in Biel and he did not play in 
Groningen).
It was at this unusual moment that Kar­
pov and I met at the regular super- 
tournament in Linares. For me this was a 
new test: on this occasion I faced the rivalry 
not simply of an ex-world champion, whom I 
had defeated in an official match for the title 
(1990), but of a newly-fledged FIDE cham­
pion. Of course, Karpov was experiencing a 
mental boost and was burning with a desire 
to demonstrate his strength. Especially as for 
many years he had been quite unable to win 
in Linares and, moreover, in 1992 and 1993 I 
had finished first with a score of 10 out of 
13, while Karpov had finished behind me, 
respectively, by 2V2 and l ’/i points. Now he 
was eager for revenge. In addition, he was 
openly supported by the organisers, by the 
leaders of the Spanish Federation, and by 
television and the press. The psychological 
atmosphere at the tournament was excep­
tionally difficult for me, but that was some­
thing I was accustomed to.
31

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
An important role, as it later transpired, 
was played by the drawing of lots, which 
placed us alongside each other: I drew num­
ber 10, and Karpov ll. I remember being 
pleased that I would have White against him, 
but the experienced arbiter Vladimir Dvork­
ovich commented: ‘It’s too early to be rejoic­
ing! All the contestants, except one (Lautier), 
will play the two of you in succession - first 
you, and then Karpov. Can you imagine what 
state they will be in?’ I did not attach any 
importance to his words, but they proved to 
be prophetic. Averbakh: ‘It is quite possible 
that the pairings were the secret of such a fine 
result by Karpov: after their games with 
Kasparov, all the players were pretty ex­
hausted when they came to play him.’ How­
ever, this alone can hardly explain the miracle 
which occurred or the staggering good 
fortune which accompanied the FIDE cham­
pion right from the start.
‘One’s mood is affected by luck’, Karpov 
was to say after the tournament. This 
thought was confirmed in the very first 
round, when with Black in a time scramble 
he snatched victory ‘out of nothing’ against 
Lautier (extracts of this and other games by 
Karpov are given in Part V of My Great 
Predecessors). That day I defeated Bareev 
with Black in a Benko Gambit.
In the second round I quite cleanly out­
played lllescas in a Tarrasch, while Karpov 
‘took over’ Bareev from me and, knowing his 
attachment to the French Defence, remem­
bered his old love - 1 e4, and initiated his 
favourite play against an isolated pawn. 
Bareev equalised, but five moves before the 
time control, now in a dead-drawn ending, 
he inexplicably blundered a rook and a mate 
in one move!
So, we started with two wins and in the 
third round we both had Black: after a com­
plicated battle I made a draw in my first duel
with Topalov, but Karpov played the opening 
badly against lllescas and stood clearly worse 
- when his opponent suddenly ‘cooperated’ 
by allowing his queen to be trapped in the 
middle of the board. 3 out of 3!
In the fourth round I managed to beat 
Vassily Ivanchuk in impressive style. Our 
games were always gripping, and with 
White between Moscow 1988 and Linares 
1994 I contrived to win six times in a row. 
And each time I had to solve a difficult 
problem in my choice of opening strategy, 
since the Ukrainian grandmaster’s reper­
toire is extraordinarily broad and anything 
can be expected of him.

native. The greedy 16 £>xb5?l would have 
allowed I6...#e5+! 17 #e2 (17 'if l exd5l)
17.. .#xe2+ (I7...1.d2+? 18 'ifl!) 18 4 >xe2 
0-0-0 (18...0-0 or 18...'4T8 will also do) 19 
£>xa7+ 4^8 20 £>b5 (weak is 20 £>c6+? Axc6 
21 dxc6 2d2+) 20...exd5 with excellent play 
for the pawn.
16.. .0.0-0 17 £sxb5
Now is the right time. Although Black has 
the advantage of the two bishops, a pawn 
mass in the centre and the possibility of 
counterplay on the h-file typical of the 
Botvinnik Variation, I was hoping to exploit 
the open position of the black king and I 
thought that in the forthcoming interesting 
battle White’s chances were nevertheless 
better.
17...exd5?

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
The thirst of battle! Vassily captured the 
pawn quite quickly and looked very content. 
However, 17...a6! 18 £>c3 exd5 was neces­
sary, when 19 £>xd5?! is weak in view of 
19-.We6 20 Sel Sxd5 21 &xd5 Wxd5 22 
Wxd5 &xd5 23 Se5 £.e6! 24 Sxc5+ *b7, etc. 
In the second half of the 1990s I studied 19 
Sel! &b8 and the unclear 20 Sbl (20 £>a4 
Wd6!) 20...d4 21 £>e4Wb6 22 a3 a5! (22...f5?! 
23 b4! is dangerous) 23 #34 Wc6 24 Wxc4 f5 
25 b4 axb4 26 axb4 JLd2L
But 21st century correspondence players 
have discovered that 20 Wa4! .&g7 21 Sadi 
Wf5 22 Se7 .&d4 23 Sd2 is better for White, 
and instead of lg.-.&bS they have begun 
successfully upholding 19-.d4!? 20 jLxb7+ 
<&xb7 21 £>e4 Wc6 22 Wh5 *b8!.
However, it is easy to give recommenda­
tions, knowing the result of the game. Who 
could have imagined that the white a-pawn 
would soon become a battering-ram, sweep­
ing away everything in its path?
18 £>x a7+ &b8 19 £>b5
Black now has a very unpleasant position, 
and the point is not that White has an extra 
pawn (although it will also come in useful), 
but that his knight is established on b5 and 
the mechanism of the subsequent attack 
has been created - Wel-a5 is threatened.
19...&g7
If 19...She8, then 20 Sell. After 19..JLg5 I 
was also considering 20 Sel, but 20 Wei! 
Sd7 21 b3! is more forceful (lonov-V.Popov, 
St. Petersburg 1997). Black also cannot be 
satisfied with 19...Wb6 20 a4 d4 21 jLxb7 
Wxb7 22 Wh5! ± U  23 I f 5! (23 Wxc5? Sxh2!)
23.. .5h4 24 Sael! Sg8 25 f3 (25 Se5l?)
25.. JLe3+ 26 Sxe3, obtaining a knight and 
three pawns for a rook, or 22...Wd5 (22...Sd5 
23 Wf3!) 23 Wxd5 Sxd5 24 £>a3, etc.
20 a4! (20 Wa4? Wa6 or 20 Wei?! Wb6 is 
premature - Stohl)
20.. .WH6
A difficult choice: 20...Wxb2? 21 Sbl Wf6 
22 Sel and wins, while my old prescription
20.. .5.6(?!) is bad because of 21 Wd2! 
(Ionov). 20..JLc6 21 h4! is also insufficient.
21 h4 i-f6?!
With the obvious threat of ..JLxh4, but for 
a successful counterattack Black is short of 
precisely one tempo. But after 2l..JLxb2?! 22 
Sbl the opening of the b-file causes his 
downfall: 22...C3 23 Wb3 Wb6 (23...C4 24 Wb4 
Wf8 25 Sxb2! - Stohl) 24 a5! Wxa5 25 £>xc3 
Wxc3 26 Wb5! Wb4 27 Wxb4 cxb4 28 Sxb2 or
22.. .Wf6 23 Sxb2! Wxb2 24 Wei! Wf6 
(24...Wb4 25 We7!) 25 Wa5 Wa6 26 Wc7+ 
<£>38 27 Wxc5 with a decisive advantage.
In Informator I suggested 21...Wg6(?!), but 
this is weak because of 22 Wd2! with the
34

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
threat of Wf4+ or Wa5. It was better to 
restrain the white queen with 21„.She8 
(Stohl), although also here after 22 Wc2! 
Black’s position is unenviable.
22 Wei!
I was proud of this unexpected move: in­
stinctively one wants to move the rook from 
fl as soon as possible (to avoid a mate on h2), 
but the queen, on the contrary, blocks it in.
22...^.xh4?! (consistent, but 22~.Sd7 23 Wa5 
iLxh4 was more resilient)
23 Wa5?l
How to refrain from such a thrust? In the 
heat of the battle I missed 23 We5+! 'iaS 24 
Wc7 with an easy win: 24~.ji.g5 25 Wa5+ 
^b8 26 Wa7+ *c8 27 Wxc5+ *b8 28 Wc7+ 
4>a8 29 f4! or 24.~i.e7 (Stohl) 25 Sfel id 6
26 Wa5+ *b8 27 Wa7+ *c8 28 a5l. But now 
the situation could have become somewhat 
more complicated.
23...i.e7?!
This hastens the end. If 23~.Wc6? White 
would even have won by 24 gxh4 2dg8 25 
Sfel! (but not my Informator move 25 f3?? 
Sxg2+!), or more surely by 24 Wa7+ &c8 25 
i.h3+ Sd7 26 Wa5! (threatening £sa7+) 
26„.<&b8 27 i.xd7 Wxd7 28 Wa7+ *c8 29 
Wxc5+ *b8 30 Wa7+ <&c8 31 Wd4! (and if 
31.~i.f6 32 Wxf6 Wh3, then 33 Wf5+!).
However, 23-Sd7 would have given more 
hopes of saving the game - although after 
24 Wa7+ *c8 25 Wxc5+ &b8 26 Sfdl! White 
is a pawn up with an attack and an objec­
tively winning position, he would still have 
had some work to do.
24 Wc7+ <ia8 25 Wa5+ (on the threshold of 
time-trouble I decided to repeat moves to 
save time) 25—&b8 26 Wc7+ &a8
27 Sfel!
Both a defence against mate, and a deci­
sive entry of the rook into the battle. 
27...i-d6 (guarding the c5-pawn) 28 Wb6
Here I saw the spectacular combinative 
idea with 30 Se81! and I began putting it 
into effect. True, in so doing I missed the 
simple 28 Wa5+! *b8 29 Wa7+ <&c8 30 a5! 
with the murderous threat of a5-a6.

A high-quality game, which brought me a 
mass of satisfaction - and 3V2 out of 4. But 
Karpov easily beat Topalov and reached 4 
out of 4! Fot the moment this did not greatly 
concern me: I sensed that I was running into 
form and I believed in the triumph of com­
petitive justice.
My problems began from the fifth round. 
The first meeting at the board with the 18- 
yeaT-old Judit PolgaT, who was making heT 
debut in the tournament, unexpectedly 
proved to be a difficult test foT me.

If 8 &e3 0-0 9 g4, then 9-d5 (Shirov-

8...0-0 is more accurate, when 9 'A’h l (9

(Game Nos.37, 86), and 9 Wei b5! 10 &f3 b4 
11 £idl e5 leads to equality (Ivanchuk - 
Kasparov, Wijk aan Zee 2001).
9 Wei
After this move I became slightly ill at 
ease: in the event of 9 .0-0 10 l?g3 Black 
must either encounter a dangerous pawn 
sacrifice - lO ...!^?! 11 &e3 l rxb2 12 jLf2 
^ 4  13 e5l (Game N0.63 in Part III of My 
Great Predecessors), or go in for the variation
10.. .£ic6 11 ile3 which I did not greatly like. 
After thinking for some time, I decided to try 
and take my opponent aback.
9.. .^bd7l?
An extremely rare reply, and, as it seemed 
to me, second-rate.
10 a4
To my surprise, Polgar made this nomi­
nally new but typical move very quickly. 10 
■&f3l? (preventing ...b7-b5) is far more dan­
gerous, when I0...h5?! is dubious (Zucker- 
man-Benko, New York 1976), as is 10...0-0 11 
■Ahl ,Ab8?! (ll...2e8 is better) 12 a4 2b8 13 
g4! with an attack (Kasparov-Short, Moscow 
Olympiad 1994). Here I was planning the 
unusual 10...h6!? with the idea of ...2g8 and 
...g7-g5, for example: 11 'A’h l (ll a4l?)
11.. .2g8 12 #dl?l (12 f5 £>e5 13 .&e2 is 
better) 12...g5 13 f5 e5 (Geller-Rublevsky, 
Elista 1995).
10.. .b6 11 £f3 i.b7
Now Black has a perfectly decent position: 
White has spent a tempo on Wei, although 
the queen would be better placed on e2.

White loses a pawn (Florian-Keller, Vienna 
1947). But the preparatory 12 ■A’hl set me 
another problem.
12...2d8!
Essential prophylaxis against the advance

36...&f8?
An instance which significantly affected 
my subsequent performance in the tourna­

(with the idea of 38 JLxd7 Sd8!), 36...£sg4 37

36.. .5.8(?!), which is less clear in view of 37 
.&f3 Sxb2 38 £se4, White has few chances of 
saving the game.
But where did this ridiculous knight move 
come from? In time-trouble suddenly I 
nervously picked up the d7-knight and 
placed it on c5, but immediately - without 
taking my hand off it, but merely releasing 
my fingers - I saw that if 36...£sc5? there is 
the fork 37 ^.c6!, when it is now Black who

And in view of 47 Bal(bl) ^ 4  White re­

Despite the mutual mistakes, an interest­
ing game, rich in adventures. Immediately 
after it Judit and I sat down to analyse 
variations. Journalists and photographers 
crowded round our table, and they were 
joined by Judit’s elder sister Susan and her 
mother Klara. And, according to the press, 
after a lengthy analysis everyone departed 
content.
I now had 4'h out of 5. But that day Kar­
pov received a valuable present from Ivan­
chuk, who employed a novelty with White, 
obtained a favourable position and an hour 
in hand on the clock, but suddenly ‘floun­
dered’, blundered an important pawn on the 
28th move and promptly resigned. 5 out of 
5! It was then that the anxious thought first 
crept into my mind: suppose this continues?
In the sixth round I again had Black and 
with difficulty I saved half a point in a skir­
mish with Gelfand, while Karpov again 
remembered about 1 e4 and methodically 
outplayed Polgar: l...c5 2 c3l? e6 3 d4 d5 4 
exd5 exd5 5 £tf3 £k6 6 Jk.b5 c4?! 7 £Je5l ^ 6  
8 &xc6+ bxc6 9 0-0 JLd6 10 b3l, etc.
Meanwhile, the Spanish newspaper ABC 
published a report by Roman Toran (a well- 
known FIDE official, and a colleague of Cam- 
pomanes and Karpov), in which he claimed 
that in the game with Polgar I had supposedly 
made the move 36...£k5, and then replaced it 
with another. This had allegedly been estab­
lished by examining the TV footage - Spanish 
TV had filmed the game.
Vladimir Dvorkovich: ‘Here were given the 
words of the chief arbiter Carlos Falcon, who 
observed the time scramble in this game: “At
no point did Kasparov break contact with the 
knight. And Polgar did not appeal to me." But 
this ‘news’ also found its way into other 
organs of the press. They began saying that 
journalists were about to be shown the video 
recording of this episode. A scandal blew up. 
Here Luis Rentero, who had also watched the 
game, acted resolutely: he put out a press­
release, in which he stated that a number of 
unscrupulous journalists were inflating a 
made-up episode, that this was damaging 
the tournament's prestige and that he would 
not allow any demonstrations of the video 
tape. Things immediately quietened down! I, 
however, was shown the video tape. An 
examination of it at normal speed does not 
demonstrate anything. When slowed down (I 
looked at the tape several times at various 
speeds) one can see the fingers parting, but it 
is impossible to establish that the piece was 
completely released.'
The psychological attack on me had not 
only immediate, but also long-term conse­
quences. A recent pronouncement by Evgeny 
Bareev, one of the players in that tourna­
ment, is typical: 'In his time Kasparov said: if 
you have slightly let go of the piece, this does 
not count. Well, for him it does not count. 
That is, his 'code of ethics’ allows him to take 
a move back. It is good that the cameras were 
filming and the video was later shown. Since 
then I have never believed Kasparov.’
It was on this terrible background that in 
the seventh round I had White against 
Karpov. I was on 5 out of 6, but my eternal 
opponent had 6 out of 6! Everyone realised 
that this was the decisive game of the tour­
nament. Before it there was a free day, and 
Sergey Makarychev and I spent a long time 
racking our brains over how on this occasion 
to try and breach the Caro-Kann Defence. In 
it I twice won against Karpov in Amsterdam 
(1988), and twice in Linares (1992 and 2001),
42

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
but on this occasion, in 1994, something 
went wrong, and evidently I burned myself 
out even while preparing for the game. I find 
it hard to remember another similar prepa­
ration for a game, after which, playing 
White, by the 13th move I already found 
myself in such an unpleasant position. I was 
obliged to tTy and save myself - as it is said, 
a game where things just didn't happen 
(Game No.39 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988- 
2009).
Averbakh: ‘Whereas in the previous two 
Linares tournaments it was his victories over 
Karpov that, to a large extent, determined 
Kasparov’s ultimate success, this time it was a 
case of ‘diamond cut diamond’: the game 
ended in a draw, and the gap remained 
unchanged.’
In the eighth round I drew with Black in a 
very complicated game with Shirov, but the 
inspired, leader, also with Black, outplayed 
Gelfand in time-trouble, although initially 
the latter gained an obvious advantage, on 
the 24th move he could have set his oppo­
nent very difficult problems, and on the 37th 
he could at least have maintained equality. 
7V2 out of 8! I was now one and a half points 
behind.
In the ninth round I played the 19-year- 
old Gata Kamsky, against whom things 
usually went quite well for me. By that time 
he (like both Anand and Kramnik) was 
already a quarter-finalist in the candidates 
matches of both series, PCA and FIDE.

A year earlier in the previous Linares, Gata

repeated!

On encountering a new plan, Kamsky first 
of all preserves his bishop from exchange and 
defends the h6-pawn. And indeed, after

there is the unpleasant 14 £>e4 cxd4 
(l4...Af8? 15 dxc5!) 15 #xh6 (Wells-Gonzalez

After this I spent a long time analyzing a 
sharp exchange sacrifice - 17 c3?l ^.xal 18

sion that after I8...2g6! Black should be able 
to defend: with his enormous material

A short but interesting battle. I now had 7 
out of 9 - more points than in all my previ­
ous victorious tournaments in Linares. But 
on this occasion I merely reduced the gap 
behind the leader: Karpov was unable to win 
a superior ending against Shirov and was on 
‘only’ 8 out of 9.
I still had to play Kramnik, Anand, Be- 
liavsky and Lautier. As in previous years, I 
was pinning my hopes on a powerful finish, 
but here there was the dreadful tournament 
atmosphere, apparently in keeping with the 
ideas of my enemies about how the official
FIDE world champion should be helped. No 
sooner had the talk of my ‘released hand’ in 
the game with Polgar begun to die away, 
when persistent rumours began circulating 
about how Kramnik and Beliavsky were 
bound to ‘throw’ their games against me. 
This had never happened in my life! All this 
preyed hugely on my nerves, and in the end I 
cracked under the pressure.
In the tenth round - a rare instance in this 
tournament - fortune turned its back on my 
rival: after reaching an endgame against 
Kamsky with an extra pawn and winning 
chances, he threw away his advantage with 
his hasty 33rd move. Alas, this did not help 
me: aiming at all costs to win with Black 
against Kramnik, I played the King’s Indian 
Defence too riskily, overstepped the mark, 
came under attack in the endgame, and lost. 
It was with this game that my problems with 
Kramnik began: that same year I twice lost 
to him in PCA rapid tournaments - on 22 
April in Moscow and on 30 June in New York. 
Later, it is true, I began recouping my losses, 
but the complex of a difficult opponent had 
emerged.
The leader was again l'/i points ahead, 
and now there were just three rounds before 
the finish. My last hope was the llth  round, 
in which Karpov played Kramnik, and I 
played Vishy Anand. In this game I was 
successful.

of developing an initiative in the event of
16.. .0.0 17 e5! (Rublevsky-Nevednichy, Tivat

White to achieve an advantage and there is 
a complicated game in prospect (Lastin- 
Lukin, Elista 1995).

A thematic tactical nuance: White does

example:

with two possible continuations:
a) 17..Mb7 18 #g4! b4 (l8...g6? 19 Sxf7l,

b3 ^xe5 26 Ad4, and in both cases White 
has an endgame with an extra pawn.
14 a4l
Before the storming of Black’s king’s for­
tress, his counterplay with ...b7-b5 must be 
forestalled. If immediately 14 g4, then
14.. .b5 15 g5 i£>d7 16 a3?! £)b6!, seizing the 
initiative (Al.Sokolov-Golovin, Kstovo 1994).
14.. .b6 (the clamping a4-a5 was threatened)
15 g4!
Now is the time! Even despite the fact that 
this Scheveningen tabiya occurs far more 
often with White to move, and he is able ‘free 
of charge’ to play g4-g5, .&g2 and Sf3 (fresh 
examples: Alekseev-Golod, Biel 2005; Kasim- 
dzhanov-J.Polgar, San Luis 2005), or Whs and 
f4-f5 (Alekseev-Movsesian, Dagomys 2006).
Now Black faces a problem: how to make 
best use of the extra tempo?
15.. .5.8
A typical move, preparing not so much 
...b6-b5, as ...£>a5 with the threat of ...£>c4 
(which is even more effective with the white 
queen on d2). Makarychev recommended 
15-.i.b7, but after 16 g5 £>d7 17 &g2 White
48

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
does not change his plan of attack, since on 
gl his king is more comfortable than in the 
similar set-up with &hl, for example:
17...Sac8 18 Sf3 2fe8 19 Sh3 g6 20 Wei! 
£>b4 21 1^4 h5 22 ±f3! ±f8? (22...*g7l 23 
£xi4! e5 24 f5 is not so clear) 23 .&xh5! gxh5 
24 f5 exf5 25 f^ h s ±g7 26 £sd4 Se5 27 Sfl 
£if8? (27..McA is more resilient) 28 £sxf5 
Sxf5 29 exf5 and wins (Galdunt-W.Miiller, 
Badenweiler 1994).
However, at the board I was more con­
cerned about the 
sharp 
continuation 
15—d5l? 16 exd5 Sd8, and here I examined 
the tempting queen sacrifice - 17 dxc6 Sxdl 
18 Saxdl. My optimistic analysis of this line 
was published in Informator and the maga­
zine Shakhmatny Vestnik, but later I came to 
the conclusion that after l8..JLb4l? White 
has no advantage and the chances are equal. 
17 We2!? £sxd5 18 £)xd5 exd5 19 c3 with a 
small plus is probably better.
16 g5 £ld7 17 ±g2
This position has also occurred many 
times with White to move, and he has 
immediately begun his attack with Sf3-h3 
(an example: Slizhevsky-Bryzgalin, Dagomys 
2006).
17...Se8
Again a typical move, vacating the f8- 
square for the bishop or knight. The nervy
I7...b5?l is premature on account of 18 axb5 
axb5 19 #621, when White turns his atten­
tion to the queenside weaknesses. 17...£>a5 
18 £kU! £ sc4 19 Acl b5? is even worse in 
view of 20 axb5 axb5 21 b3l £sa3 (21...£se3 
22 £scxb5l) 22 £)f5l with crushing threats.
I8 2f3
By transposition and with a different 
move numeration White earlier played 18 
Whs (Kagan-Csom, Sao Paulo 1973), 18 We2 
(Spassky-Kindermann, 
Bundesliga 
1984), 
and 18 ^ h l (Serper-MacKay, Adelaide 1988), 
and later both 18 f5 (Safarli-Serban, Istanbul 
Olympiad 2012), and 18 h4 .&b7 19 h 5 
(Berger-Schlosser, Bundesliga 2012).
Why did I choose the typical rook ma­
noeuvre? Let us compare the diagram 
position with the well-known position after 
1 e4 c5 2 £)f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 £)xd4 £)f6 5

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov). Here 
White’s king (on h i instead of gl) and his 
queen (on d2 instead of dl) are both worse 
placed, but the main thing is that it is Black 
to move, and he can defend successfully 
with 17..~&b7 18 Sf3 £)a5l (l8...±f8?l is

White’s attack is based on the threat of 21

with the f4-f5 break.
20...£)b4?
A decisive although by no means obvious 
mistake. In seeking a counterattack on the 
queenside, Black’s army conclusively aban­
dons its king to its fate. White is also better 
afteT 20...if8?l 21 1 ^ 4  h5 22 gxh6! (in

came to the conclusion that after 22...®d7?

22.. JLb7 would seem to enable Black to hold 
on: 23 Sfl i f 8! 24 Sf3 ig 7  or 23 f5 ®e5! 
etc., and 23 g6(!) fxg6 24 #xg6+ 4h8 forces 
only a draw.

However, the computer extended this last 
variation - 25 ®xc5 dxc5 26 1i rh6+ 4g8 27

Incidentally, the g5-g6 break is also very

And yet Vishy had the opportunity for a 
far more resilient defence, for example:

Allowing the bishop sacrifice, although at

In going in for this variation, Anand was 
pinning his hopes on his 25th move - but in

after 24 JLd4l e5 25 f5! all the same Black

We4l 1-0
Not wishing to drag out the hopeless re­
sistance, Black resigned.
I reached 8 out of 11. But Karpov won in 
good style against Kramnik, who had not yet 
regained his composure after his game with 
me, and was now on 9V2 out of ll! Aver­
bakh: ‘The question of first place was essen­
tially decided by Kramnik: after winning 
against Kasparov, in the next round he lost 
to Karpov’ (Game No.103 in Part V of My 
Great Predecessors). At this the race con­
cluded.
In the 12th round I had a highly painful 
game with Beliavsky, who performed ex­
tremely badly in the tournament: because of 
the talk about the ‘throwing’ of the game, I 
was by definition, so to speak, unable to win. 
This draw concluded our meetings in ‘classi­
cal’ play (+11-2=14). That day Karpov drew 
with Anand, and in the final, 13th round he 
crushed Beliavsky in a Catalan. But I, having 
completely lost my motivation, recklessly 
attacked with White against the 20-year-old 
tournament debutant Joel Lautier and 
resigned as early as the 30th move, allowing 
Shirov to catch me.
It is unlikely that anyone expected such a 
stunning victory for Karpov. Everything 
worked out for him, he won from almost any 
position, and in the end he achieved one of 
the most impressive tournament results in 
chess history (+9=4). When I had not yet 
cooled down after the battle, I said: ‘In my 
view, this competitive triumph was not 
supported by outstanding play. I have seen 
Karpov play better. Now he has found an 
optimal manner of play, which by virtue of 
his personal and playing qualities enables 
him to achieve the maximum results with 
the minimum expenditure of nervous 
energy. A kind of apotheosis of pragmatism! 
On this occasion I played badly, but my
52

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
attitude to this is simple: I will endeavour to 
play well in the next tournament.’
But for this I needed to replenish my store, 
firstly, of nervous energy, and, secondly, of 
opening ideas. It was after Linares 1994 that 
I sensed for the first time that my opening 
knowledge, accumulated in the 1980s and 
early 1990s, was largely exhausted, and that 
a leap to a new, qualitatively different level 
was needed. The young generation was now 
looking at other openings! Thus for me this 
amazing tournament became a turning- 
point, and its outcome a kind of historic 
punishment for the mistake of 1993-
For Karpov this was undoubtedly the 
"tournament of his life’. After it the FIDE 
champion apparently decided that by now 
he had demonstrated everything to every­
one, and he even made a bold statement in 
the press: ‘Yes, I would like to play another 
match with Kasparov, but now he needs this 
match more than I do.’ Soon Karpov’s tour­
nament successes began to decline and, as 
in the early 1980s, he endeavoured to avoid 
meeting me at the board. But even so I was 
able to tum the tables in Las Palmas 1996 
and Linares 2001.
Soon after my return from Linares a con­
venient opportunity at last presented itself 
for me to make peace with Botvinnik (I should 
remind you that we had had serious ideologi­
cal disagreements). In April 1994 Moscow 
together with the PCA was preparing to stage 
a grandiose festival - the ‘Kremlin stars’ 
rapid-play knock-out tournament. 
How 
honourable and symbolic it would be if the 
chief arbiter of the first super-tournament in 
the Kremlin were to be the great Botvinnik! 
And so with Andrei Makarov, the new Presi­
dent of the Russian Chess Federation, and 
grandmaster Averbakh, the organiser of this 
meeting, I went to see Botvinnik in his office 
on the second floor of the Central Chess Club.
By that time Mikhail Moiseevich’s eye­
sight was very poor, in fact he was almost 
blind: he moved about with the help of his 
nephew. But his mind was completely clear. 
Just as 15-20 years earlier, he knew exactly 
what he wanted and what he didn’t want. 
He listened impassively to our suggestion 
that he should be the chief arbiter of the 
tournament and, after a little thought, he 
rapped out: 'Rapid chess will be the death of 
our game!' Or something of that sort.
I said to him: ‘Mikhail Moiseevich, but this 
form of the game is one that will make it 
more popular...’ But he replied: ‘This will 
cause enormous damage, colossal damage.’ I 
tried again: ‘This is how everyone is playing 
- hundreds of grandmasters. Even Vasily 
Vasilievich is playing in this tournament!’ 
And he in reply: 7 don’t give a damn about 
the opinion of the majority! I am used to 
thinking with my own mind!'
That was Botvinnik to the core. And so we 
left empty-handed. That was my last meet­
ing with the Teacher.
Amsterdam Quartet
Double-Round Match-Toumament in Am­
sterdam (Euwe Memorial, 11-18 May 1994):
1. Kasparov - 4 out of 6; 2. Ivanchuk - 3!/j; 3. 
Timman - 2 Vi; 4. Short - 2.
My first ‘classical’ appearance after 
Linares was in May at the Euwe Memorial in 
Amsterdam. The organisers were intending 
to stage a double-round, four-player match- 
tournament of all the contestants in the 
recent title matches - Kasparov, Short, 
Karpov and Timman! As the press wrote, ‘in 
this case the event would have acquired the 
character of an absolute world champion­
ship - of FIDE and the PCA'. But, alas, after 
his Linares triumph Karpov declined to play 
and was quickly replaced by Ivanchuk - a
53

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
player with truly champion-like playing 
potential, although without a champion-like 
stability of results.
Over such a short distance - just six 
rounds! - any of my three opponents could 
have been my rival. After obtaining No.l in 
the drawing of lots, at the start, to my dis­
tress, for the first time in my life I was un­
able to beat Ivanchuk with White - a draw 
as early as the 2lst move! Meanwhile, Short 
beat Timman with White and took the lead. 
But the second round, in which I played 
Nigel Short, brought a change of leader. That 
day I was able to make use of something 
from the extensive analytical knowledge 
accumulated for our 1993 match. At the 
time many were surprised by why Short 
avoided his usual French Defence, and at last 
something from the submerged part of the 
iceberg was revealed.

The most popular continuation. 9...a6 
comes to the same thing after 10 0-0-0 (10

ah el, g2-g4 and f4-f5, J.Polgar-Short, Buenos 
Aires 2000) 11 h4, etc.
Another well-trodden path is 9...^.xd4 10 
JLxd4 <S^xd411 #xd4 #b6. We looked closely 
at the endgame after 12 #xb6 £ixb6, and 
here instead of 13 £>b5 &e7 14 0-0-0 ,&d7 
with equality (Chandler-Short, Hastings 
1988/89), I was attracted by 13 a4l? (Kas- 
parov-Bareev, Novgorod 1997).
In addition, there was the gambit idea 12 
#d2l? #xb2 (I2...£sc5 13 0-0-0 jLd7 14 #d4

intending 16 Sdl, but after l6...b6 17 .&d3 
#a5l Black is okay (Almasi-Bareev, Monte 
Carlo (rapid) 2003). Therefore it is better to 
play 16 Sell? #b2 17 .&e2 (Grischuk- 
Zvjaginsev, Mainz (rapid) 2005), or I6...b6 17 
.&e2! #a5 18 c3 (Carlsen-Prasca, Turin 
Olympiad 2006) with sufficient compensa­
tion for the pawn.
10 0-0-0
Castling suggests itself, but the prophy­
lactic move 10 g3 is also possible, for exam­
ple: 10...#e7 11 0-0-0 £sb6?l 12 £sb3l i.xe3
13 #xe3 ii.d7 14 'A’bl with some advantage 
for White (Kasparov-Shirov, Astana 2001).
10.. .a6 11 h4
A fashionable plan at that time. 11 ‘A’bl 
was also played (De Firmian-Short, Manila 
Interzonal 1990), but 11 £>b3l? or l l  #f2l? is 
objectively better (an example: Kramnik- 
Radjabov, Linares 2003).
11.. .£ixd4 12 ^.xd4 b5
13 Sh3!?
13 ‘i ’bl would have led to a position from 
the De Firmian-Short game, in which after
13.. .^.b7 14 h5 b4 15 £se2 a5 16 i.xc5l £sxc5 
17 £>d4 £se4 18 #e3 White gained a small 
advantage. However, already then it was 
known that the immediate I3...b4l 14 £sa4 
(14 £se2 a5) 14...i.xd4 15 #xd4 a5 or
15.. .#a5 16 b3 .&b7 is more active.
The immediate 13 h5 is more reasonable, 
but here also after 13...b4 Black can defend:
14 £se2 a5 15 .&xc5 ^xc5 16 #e3 # b 6 
(l6...#c7l?) 17 f5 a4 18 ‘i b l  (Smirin-Lputian, 
Rostov-on-Don 1993) I8...#c7l with the idea 
of ...<S^e4, or 14 <S^a4 J.xd4 15 #xd4 #a5l? 
(stronger than 15-.a5, Nunn-Lputian, Manila 
Olympiad 1992) 16 b3 .&b7 17 h6 (the sharp

18.. JLc6 19 £>b2 #c5 with approximate 
equality.
In playing 13 Sh3 I was pinning my hopes 
not on a direct attack, but rather on White’s 
long-term pluses, resulting from his superior 
pawn structure. It is important above all to 
hinder ...f7-f6 and the immediate opening of 
the centre.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
Now 13...^.b7 deserves consideration, 
since in the event of 14 h5 b4 15 £*e2 a5 16 
&bl, instead of the concrete JLxc5 and ®d4 
(De Firmian-Short) White has made the 
ratheT abstract move Slh3. Equally unclear, 
double-edged play results from 14 g4 b4 15 
£*e2 a5 16 g5 .&a6! 17 h5 Wb6 (Jongsma- 
Stellwagen, Nijmegen 2002), ot 14 a3 ®e7 
(NajeT-A.Rychagov, Krasnoyarsk 2007).
14 £sa4 i.xd4 15 l rxd4
This position, which first occurred in Ni- 
jboer-LutheT, (LeeuwaTden 1992), was one 
that I discussed before the 1993 match at a 
training session in Podolsk with my friend 
Smbat Lputian, a great expert on the French 
Defence.
15...f6?!
A novelty! The afore-mentioned game 
went 15...1Bra5?! 16 b3 ^.b7 17 c3! Sfc8 18 
&b2 bxc3+ 19 Sxc3 fixc3 20 l rxc3 l rxc3+ 21 
^xc3 with a favourable endgame foT White, 
but Black could have complicated the play 
with 20...'Brd8! and ...Hc8 (NijboeT’s recom­
mendation 21 Scl 2c8 22 Wb4 is ineffective 
in view of 22...Sxcl! 23 &xcl ±c6 24 g3 a5 
25 l fd4 i.xa4 26 #xa4 £ ic5 27 ®d4 £te4 28 
f5l). Therefore we gave preference to 20 
£)xc3! and came to the conclusion that here 
White’s chances are better.
That is what I was intending to play.
However, Lputian, returning to the position 
depicted in the diagram, said: ‘Here there is 
the excellent move 15-.f6 - White’s centre is 
destroyed, and Black has no particular 
problems.’ When Smbat left, Makarychev 
and I carefully studied this move and de­
vised an idea, which became our prepara­
tion for the London match. But the French 
did not occut there, and by the will of fate 
the preparation went into operation seven 
months lateT...
To be faiT, it should be mentioned that 
Black has a perfectly acceptable defence -
I5...a5! (with the idea of ,.JLa6), and if 16 
JLbs Sb8 17 -&d3 not only is l7..Wc7 possi­
ble (Fogaiasi-LutheT, Kecskemet 1993), but 
also 17...&06 18 £*c5 £*d7 (NijboeT-M.GuTe- 
vich, Essen 2001), or 17...f6 (Langheinrich- 
Shirov, Bundesliga 2003).
16 #xb4! (of course, not 16 exf6 Wxf6 with 
equality) I6...fxe5
17 Wd6!
This unexpected interposition promises 
Black far more problems than the simple- 
minded 17 fxe5 £ixe5 18 Se3 £*c6 (Stohl) 19 
1T)6! #d6 20 g3 ot I8...a5 19 1^4 £)g6 20

obtain a ‘FischeT’ bishop and put pressure on 
the e6-pawn.

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
The only move: after 17...£>f6? 18 'VlxdS 
£xd819 fxe5 Black is simply a pawn down in 
an endgame. The culminating moment has 
been reached.
18 f5l!
The crux of White’s idea. After quickly 
making this flamboyant move, 1 decided that 
matters were practically decided. But years 
later, when a computer joined the analysis, 
it transpired that the win was still a long 
way off.
l8...Wh6+
Again the only sensible reply. The pawn is 
taboo: I8...exf5?? 19 1Srxd5+ or lS.-.l'xfS? 19

boyant way to convert my advantage, al­
though in our London analysis 20 Jte2 was

paths to the goal.
23 c4!
A vigorous move, again creating enor­
mous pressure. 23 f4i? ®e7l (the only 
chance: 23...exf4? 24 Sell and wins) also 
suggested itself, for example:
1) 24 Wc6 Bb8 25 f5 £if8 26.fxe6+! (in­
stead of the Informator move 26 £sc5?l)
26.. Jtxe6 27 Axe6+ £sxe6 28 #xd5, and 
Black faces a difficult defence;
2) 24 fxe5! Wxd6 25 exd6 - calculating 
this variation at the board, I was afraid of 
the loss of the d6-pawn after 25...£sf6 26

notice the spectacular 28 iLxe6+! Jlxe6 29

25.. .2.8 26 Bel £sf8 27 £sc5 Black also has a 
very difficult endgame (if 27...Bb4 28 d7l, 
winning a pawn).
In the end I nevertheless preferred to un­
dermine Black’s pawn centre from the other 
wing - I was attracted by an unusual attack­
ing construction.

This colourful, energetically conducted 
game improved my mood. In the third Tound 
Short drew with Ivanchuk, whereas I beat 
Timman with Black and consolidated my 
lead - 2Vi out of 3.
But in the fourth Tound I was defeated 
and caught by Ivanchuk. In our game I 
‘floundered’ right from the opening, over­
looking a powerful tactical stroke: l  e4 c5 2

large plus) 15 <£>e7+ #xe7 16 #xe7 exd4 17 
iLc4, and on the 39th move Black resigned. It 
was very painful to lose practically without a 
fight.
In the fifth Tound, which was inter­
changed with the sixth so that no one 
should have the same coIout three times in a 
row, both leaders won with White: Ivanchuk 
against Short and I in a PetToff Defence 
against Timman (cf. Game No.34 in Kasparov 
vs. Karpov 1975-1985, note to White’s 12th 
move). We both reached y /2 out of 5.
The destiny of first place was decided in 
the last Tound. Somehow submissively 
Ivanchuk lost to Timman in a slightly inferior 
endgame, while I forced a draw afteT being 
fiercely attacked by Short - I could even have 
played foT a win, but, on seeing the suffering 
of my rival on the neighbouring board, I 
decided not to take a risk.
Despite the successful finish, I was disillu­
sioned with my insipid play in both games 
with Ivanchuk. However, I did not grieve foT 
long: the very next day Short and I set off to 
Munich, in order to join battle in a pTomi-

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
nent PCA blitz tournament with the partici­
pation of 17 grandmasters and - for the first 
time in history! - the program Fritz 
3/Pentium (cf. p.210).
Partial Revenge
Double-Round PCA Super-Tournament in 
Novgorod (11-26 August 1994): 1-2. Kas­
parov and Ivanchuk - 7 out of 10; 3. Kramnik 
- 5; 4-5. Shirov and Short - 4; 6. Bareev - 3.
This was the first time that such a major 
chess event took place in Novgorod - an 
ancient Russian city, situated 500 km. north­
west of Moscow and 200 km. south of St. 
Petersburg. Together with the PCA, the 
organisers produced an optimal type of 
event: six leading grandmasters playing a 
double-round tournament. There were no 
doubts about the participation of Kasparov, 
Short, Ivanchuk and Shirov, but Kramnik 
agreed to play only after his failure in the 
summer Candidates matches, while Kamsky, 
by contrast, declined after his sensational 
match victories over Kramnik and Anand.
Karpov was also invited. The Novgorod 
organisers, armed with a high-powered 
delegation, sought him out in Moscow, but 
despite all their entreaties the FIDE cham­
pion declined the invitation, saying that he 
would not play in the PCA - ‘Kasparov’s 
personal organisation’. As a result Bareev 
became the sixth participant. But in any 
event, for the first time in the history of 
chess tournaments an average rating of 
2700 was exceeded and the 19th category 
achieved!
Despite the traditional training session 
and active relaxation by the sea, this tour­
nament was psychologically difficult for me. 
From the press: 'More often than usual 
Kasparov looked concentrated and detached 
from everything. Not as powerful as before,
there was an energy field surrounding him. It 
was sensed that he desperately needed to win 
the tournament: the world champion was 
clearly unhappy with both his results and his 
play in recent times.’
At the start I managed to win with White 
against Shirov in a rare variation of the 
English Opening - 1 c4 e5 2 £)c3 jLb4 3 £>d5 
&e7 4 d4 d6 5 e4 c6 6 £>xe7WxeT 7 £>e2, etc. 
In the second round came a fighting draw 
with Bareev in a Griinfeld. In the third I 
aimed for revenge against Ivanchuk, who 
had beaten me in Amsterdam; I played l  e4 
and obtained a promising position in a 
Sicilian (cf. Game No.79 in Part II of Carry 
Kasparov on Garry Kasparov, note to Black’s 
n th  move), but I was unable to develop my 
initiative - a draw on the 25th move. We 
both reached 2 out of 3.
In the fourth round, interchanged with 
the fifth to avoid a player having the same 
colour three games in a row, I again had 
White, this time against the. 19-year-old 
Vladimir Kramnik, my ‘1994 bogeyman’. This 
was a crucial game. When I was preparing 
for it I felt very nervous, remembering my 
three recent defeats against Kramnik (in 
Linares, Moscow and New York), but as soon 
as the first few moves were made, the 
concrete chess problems left no place for 
anxiety.

gxf6 10 4M5 (Game No.85), which brought 
Ivanchuk success in his game with Kramnik 
from the first round. LateT I analysed both 
lines a great deal, and I quite successfully 
played the Sveshnikov Variation as Black.

13 h4l?
Instead of the hackneyed 13 Ae2 Ag5 14 
0-0 a5, etc. After seeing the fresh idea 13 a3 
a5 14 h4 followed by I 4...g6 15 g3 (15 h5 
JLg5!) 15--&g7 16 h5 (Shirov-lllescas, Linares 
1994), I employed it against Kramnik (Mos­
cow (Tapid) 1994), but he confused me with
I4...£ie7, and afteT 15 £ice3?! (15 ^xf6+! is 
correct - the inclusion of the moves a2-a3 
and ...a6-a5 is in White's favour) I5...£ixd5 
16 £>xd5 ± e6 17 g3 ^ 7  18 ± g 2 £ d 8! Black 
easily equalised.
When I studied 13 a3 more closely I did 
not like the reply 13. .^.g5l? 14 £icb4 -&b7 ot
14 h4 JLh6. And so here I played 13 h4 im­
mediately.
13...^e7?!
As expected! AfteT 13...g6 14 g3 .&g715 h5 
Black’s position is also somewhat inferior 
(l5-.^.e6 16 ±h3!, J.PolgaT-lllescas, Leon 
1996), but lateT it transpired that 13-.^.e7!? 
(not weakening the kingside) 14 ^ce3 Ae6 
is safeT, with the intention of ...®d7 and 
...JLd8 (Tiviakov-Yakovich, Elista 1997; KaT- 
jakin-Yakovich, Sochi 2007).
14 £sxf6+!
A surprise! AfteT the routine 14 £sce3?! 
there would have followed 14...^xd5 15 
^xd5 iLe616 g3 ®d7 with the idea of .. JLd8, 
by analogy with out Moscow game (see
61

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
above). Kramnik appeared to be astonished 
by the capture on f6: now Black can carry out 
the thematic ...f6-f5 or ...d6-d5. Yes, in the 
Sveshnikov Variation it is customary to fight 
for control of the key d5-point, but it turns 
out that it is also possible to harass the 
enemy monarch!
14...gxf6
White is at a crossroads. The move Ti2-h4 
and the resource 0-0-0 give him chances of 
creating an attack on the king. The black 
knight will no longer feel safe on g6 on 
account ofh4-h5.
15 Wd2!?
My trainers and I also analysed 15 ^.d3l? 
- I soon employed this novelty against 
Lautier (Moscow Olympiad 1994), and after 
15-d5 (I5...f5 16 exf5! favours White, as was 
confirmed in later practice) 16 exd5 ®xd5 17 
£se3 
6 18 Whs Black was demolished in 
literally a few moves: I8...e4?! 19 -&C2 b4?! 
20 C4 <£118 21 0-0-0 f5 22 1^5 2b6 23 h5 
Sc6?! 24 i ’bl Sc5 25 h6 # e 5 26 Sh5! 2g8 27 
£sg4l! 1-0.
A better defence was I8...f5 19 0-0-0 Wg6 
(but not I9...*h8?l 20 g4! #g6 21 tfgSl f6 22 
WxgB hxg6 23 h5 g5 24 £sxf5, Teichmeister- 
Volodin, correspondence 1994), although 
here also after 20 #e2l White’s chances are 
better (less is promised by my Informator
suggestion 20 #g5 f6 21 Wxg6+ hxg6 22 
i.C2).
15...i.b7
We considered this move to be the 
strongest. If 15-..d5, then 16 0-0-0 or 16 
Hdl!?, while if 15-f5 we were planning 16 
exf5! (16 Wg5+ *h8 17 Wf6+ <&g8 18 0-0-0 
^.e6 is not so clear, Kamsky-Benjamin, San 
Diego 2004) I6...£ixf5 17 0-0-0, or I6...i.xf5 
17 0-0-0 Sb6 (I7...i.xc2 18 <&xc2!) 18 #g5+ 
4>h8 19 #f6+ <4>g8 20 JLd3 with prospects of 
an attack on Black's hole-ridden fortress.
16 i.d3?!
Played in accordance with our analysis: 
what could be more natural - both devel­
opment and the defence of the pawn. If 16 
0-0-0 JLxe4 17 ®xd6 there was the reply
17.. .£sd5! 18 Wxa6 Wc7 with normal play: 19 
i.d3 i.xd3 20 Hxd3 Sb6! 21 WaS lh7! 22 
2xd5 (22 Wa3 b4l) 22...Sa8 23 Wxa8+ Wxa8 
24 ®b4 Wf8, and White has no more than 
decent compensation for the queen.
It is unsurprising that no one saw the 
computer trick 16 £se3l, preventing I6...d5? 
in view of 17 £sg4. And after l6...JLxe4 (if
16.. .#d7, then simply 17 JLd3) 17 £sg4 ^ 8  
18 £sxf6 (what a route: £kjl-f3-d4-b5-a3-c2- 
e3-g4xf6!) l8..JLg6 19 h5 i.f5 20 i.d3 or 20 
g4l? White retains an enduring initiative.
16.. .d5!
62

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
The point. I6...4>h8? (Campora-Bhend, 
Bem 1987) is weak in view of 17 #h6! £sg6 
(I7...£ig8 18 1 Ti 5 and £se3) 18 g3 2g8 19 h5 
£sf8 20 0-0-0, then £>e3, etc.
17 exd5 #xd5
18 0-0-0!
It is not often that queenside castling is 
encountered in the Sveshnikov Variation, 
especially with the sacrifice of the a2-pawn. 
However, for the moment the black king is 
far more vulnerable...
I8...e4!
The only correct defence. In Informator I 
gave l8...1rxa2(?) 19 Wi6(?) e4 20 i.e2, 
transposing into a position from the game, 
but after 19 Sh3! with the threat of 20 Sg3+ 
£sg6 21 h5 Black is on the verge of defeat.
19 i.e 2 Wxa2
The principled decision. Both I9...'$fxd2+
20 Sxd2 and lg.-.WeS (Ftacnik) 20 h5l would 
have left White with somewhat the better 
chances.
20 Wh6 (threatening not only #xf6, but also 
Sh3-g3+) 20...'te6
Again the best move. After 20...f5? apart 
from 21 Sh3 there was also the decisive 21 
Sd7l.
21 &d4 Wb6!
Another strong reply. ‘Although Kramnik 
encountered a surprise in the opening (a
new plan with queenside castling), for a long 
time he defended brilliantly.’ (Makarychev).
We were mainly reckoning on 2l...#e5(?) 
22 f4l and thought that White had a power­
ful attack, although at the time we did not 
see a forced win. A correct and unusual way 
was suggested by the game Gildardo Garcia- 
lllescas (Linares 1994), where after 22...exf3 
(there is nothing else) 23 ^.d3l £sg6 24 g3! 
±e4 (24-f5 25 h5l) 25 i.xe4? 1fxe4 26 h5 
£se5 27 Wxf6 We3+ 28 4>bl £sg4 29 #f5 £sh6 
Black managed to gain a draw. But in the 
event of 25 Shell f5 26 £>xf5l #xf5 27 .&xe4 
Wi3 28 h5 (Stohl) or 26...f2 27 Sxe4 Wxf5 28 
h5 White would have won a piece and the 
game.
Kramnik did indeed defend brilliantly, but 
in so doing he spent much effort and time, 
which in the end led to severe time-trouble.
22 Sh3
A critical moment. It is clear that after 22 
.&g4?! ^.c8! Black is okay. When thinking 
about my move, I saw that my opponent was 
unhappy with his position, and I ascribed 
this to the consequences of the obvious 
manoeuvre 22 Sh3.
But later it transpired that Kramnik was 
concerned about a pawn advance - 22 g4l? 
4>h8 (22...iLc8? 23 Shgl and wins) 23 
£sxf5 24 gxf5, when it is not at all easy for
63

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
Black to defend: 24...b4? 25 Sd7! (with the 
murderous threats of Sgl and Ah5-g6!)
25.. .bxc3 26 Sxb7! and wins, or 24.~fibd8? 25 
Ah5! (or else 25 Sd7! Ac8 26 Ah5M) 25...Ac8 
(25...e3 26 Ag6! and Sd7) 26 Ag6! fxg6 27 
Sd7!! Axd7 28 fxg6 Sf7 29 gxf7 #d6 30 Sdl 
(30 Sgl? Ag4!) 30...1re7 31 Sxd7 - a fantas­
tic geometric solution, found on our return 
from the game.
Makarychev and I did not bother to con­
ceal our discovery from my opponent, and 
he returned the favour when, a few days 
later, also during dinner, he demonstrated 
the correct defence - 24...Sfd8! (24...e3l? 25 
Shgl Sg8 is also acceptable) 25 Ah5 e3! 26 
Shgl Sxdl+ 27 Axdl Sg8 28 Sxg8+ &xg8 
29 #xe3 # c6 with a slightly inferior but 
drawn endgame.
22.. .6H8 23 Ag4 Sg8 (23...£sg8?! 24 #h5 
with the threat of Af5) 24 5ie6?
Here there are three possibilities (not 
counting 24 £sf5?! #66!), but, alas, not one 
of them leads to the desired goal. I thought 
for a long time about which piece to place 
on e6, and in the end I put my knight there, 
overlooking after 24...Sg6 25 #f4 the reply
25.. .Ad5!. The tempting 24 Ae6?! would 
have been parried by 24...Sg6! 25 #f4 fxe6! 
26 #b8+ 5g8 27 #h2 e5 28 £sc2 £sg6! (more 
convincing than the earlier 28...#xf2) with 
excellent play for the exchange (29 g3?! b4l).
Apparently, all that remained for White 
was 24 Af5! £sxf5 (Stohl also suggests
24.. .5g7(?), but this is bad because of 25 
Sg3! Sbg8 26 Sxg7 Sxg7 27 Axh7! Sxh7 28 
#f8+ 5ig8 29 £sf5 and £se7 or Sd8) 25 £sxf5 
# e 6 26 #f4 #e5! 27 #xe5 fxe5 28 Sg3 Sxg3 
29 fxg3 Sf8 with a drawn endgame.
‘From what went on at that moment in 
the press centre I can vouch for the enor­
mous difficulties which have to be overcome 
in finding one’s way through the endless sea 
of complicated variations’ (Makarychev).
Soon, when powerful analytical programs 
appeared, everything began to look differ­
ent.
24.. .5g6!
Forced. Black would have lost ignomini- 
ously after 24...£sg6? 25 h5, 24...Sxg4? 25 
£ig5!, 24...fxe6? 25 #xf6+ Sg7 26 Sd7!, or
24.. .#xf2? 25 Sf3! Hg6 26 #xg6! etc.
25 #f4 2e8?
Allowing an incredible finale. When 
Kramnik made this move he had no more 
than two minutes left on his clock. Of course, 
like everyone else, he saw the mating varia­
tion 25...Sbg8? 26 h5 2xg4 27 #xf6+ 
S8(4)g7 28 h6 #xe6 29 hxg7+ Sxg7 30 Sd8+ 
£sg8 31 2xg8+! ^xg8 32 #d8+, but in the 
event of 25...Sc8 he was afraid of 26 £sg5, 
and after 25...Sa8 and the brilliant exchange 
of blows 26 2d6! 5ids!, the inferior endgame 
after 27 Sxb6 £sxf4 28 ^xf4 Sxg4 29 Sxf6 
etc. (with the rook on e8 the position is 
equal).
One instinctively wants to move the at­
tacked rook, especially when the last couple 
of minutes are ticking away. But 25...Ad5! 
was far stronger - in the press centre this 
move was discovered very quickly. It would 
appear that by 26 Ah5 Axe6 27 Axg6 White 
could still have fought for a win, but in a 
joint analysis after the game Kramnik found
64

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
27~.£*xg6! 28 1i rxf6+ <£>98, when it is now 
Black who is playing for a win: if 29 SeB (29 
SgB? #a5! and wins - Stohl) 29...b4l he has 
bishop and knight for a rook, while after 29 
h5 JLxh3 30 2d6 #c5l 31 hxg6 hxg6 32 gxh3 
b4 he is a sound pawn to the good.
Therefore I would have had to discard my 
dangerous illusions and urgently seek a way 
to save the game, for example: 26 ^d4l? (26 
£*g5? ^.b3l and wins) 26...b4l (Ftacnik) 27 
cxb4 ®xb4 28 Sd2 2b6 29 2g3 or 27.Jhi8!? 
28 ±f5 £>ds! 29 #xe4 £>xb4 30 ®e2 2xg2 31 
2e3 ^.ds 32 2e8+ with desperate hopes of 
defending - after all, it is rather White who 
now has the ‘bad’ king.
26 2d6!
The immediate 26 h5? would have been a 
blunder in view of 26...2xg4 27 1i rxf6+ <^>g8 
28 2h4 2xg2 29 2h2 2g4 30 2h4 ^ e 6  31 
Wxe6 fxe6 32 2xg4+ ^f7, when Black has a 
won endgame.
26...£>d5f
Resourceful defence! 26...#a5? was alto­
gether unsuitable in view of 27 h5l 2xg4 28 
#xf6+ <&g8 29 £*g5! Wan- 30 <&c2 #a4+ 31 
<^>bl Wlc4 32 h6 with unavoidable mate - 
Black does not have perpetual check.
But now there occurs one of those mira­
cles, for which we so love chess.

of which all this was started! Events develop 
by force.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
After this spectacular win I reached 3 out 
of 4, but Ivanchuk kept pace, defeating 
Bareev with Black. Then I won with Black 
against Short, and Ivanchuk with White 
against Shirov, and with a score of 4 out 5 
we were confidently leading after the first 
cycle.
In the second half of the tournament the 
FIDE officials Macropulos and Iclicki arrived, 
as well as Makarov, the president of the 
Russian Chess Federation. ‘FIDE - RCF - PCA’ 
discussions began, as well as other prob­
lems, and these affected my play.
In a sharp Sicilian duel with Shirov I was 
the exchange up by the 28th move, but in 
time-trouble by some kind of miracle I 
missed a win. Meanwhile, Ivanchuk drew 
with Kramnik and then with Short. And I, by 
beating Bareev, at last moved half a point 
ahead - 5V2 out of 7! In the eighth round the 
status quo was maintained, as a compli­
cated King’s Indian with Ivanchuk ended in a 
draw. Then in the ninth round I drew with 
Short, after failing to exploit his errors in a 
rook endgame, and in the final, tenth round 
- with Kramnik. As a result I was caught by 
Ivanchuk, who again defeated Bareev.
From the press: ‘In an  in terview  before the 
sta rt th e w orld ch am pion  prom ised th a t in 
N ovgorod w e w ou ld see a “n ew  Kasparov". A t 
th e concluding press conference he w as asked 
h o w  successful this tran sform ation  h a d  been. 
On hearing this question, Short, w h o w as 
sittin g  alongside, bu rst o u t laughing: “In m y 
opinion, G arry w as th e sa m e as he has alw ays 
been." A p p a ren tly th e ch am pion  also f e lt th a t 
th e pro m ise h ad n o t been co m p letely fulfilled. 
“The w ork has begun", he said. “I w as less 
nervous a t th e board. A n d I could h ave p layed  
b e tte r in th e secon d h a lf -  in particular, I did 
n o t w in tw o  g a m es w here I sto o d  very w ell".'
Indeed, I felt the need for a drastic re­
newal, and in particular of my opening
repertoire. However, with Makarychev I was 
unable to resolve this problem. Sergey, with 
his customary sensitivity, himself realised 
that a conflict had arisen and he wisely 
decided to give up his post of trainer. From 
November 1994 the 30-year-old grandmas­
ter Yuri Dokhoian began working with me, 
and we began patiently developing a new 
preparation conception, which was to bear 
considerable fruit in the late 1990s.
Three Best Games
International Tournament in Horgen (3-15 
September 1994): l. Kasparov - 8 V2 out of 
11; 2-3. Yusupov and Shirov - 7; 4-5. 
Korchnoi and Lautier - 6 V2; 6. Gelfand - 5 V2; 
7. Leko - 5; 8-9- Benjamin and Nikolic - 4V2; 
10-11. Miles and Lutz - 4; 12. Gavrikov - 3.
After returning from Novgorod to Mos­
cow, within just a few days I flew to London 
to take part in the third stage of the Intel 
Rapid-Play Grand Prix - and I was knocked 
out in my very first mini-match, after in­
competently losing a dead-drawn position 
against the program Genius. But as one of 
the PCA directors I had to stay there right to 
the final itself, as a result of which I was late 
for the drawing of lots in my next 'classical' 
tournament.
One of the best known chess patrons. Dr. 
William Wirth, Chairman of the board of 
directors of the Credit Suisse Bank, on this 
occasion simultaneously organised two all- 
play-all tournaments in Horgen, a suburb of 
Zurich. As the press rightly commented, ‘th e 
m ain, 
g ra n d m a ste r 
to u rn a m e n t 
proved 
rath er non-uniform , a n d  in class th e p a rtici­
p a n ts w ere as th ou gh  divid ed  in to tw o  su b ­
groups, w hich w as q u ite objectively reflected 
in th e fin a l ta b le ’.
My standard of play was initially not very 
outstanding, but my results enabled me to
66

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
fight foT the lead. In the fhst round I chose 1 
c4 and unhurriedly outplayed the 15-year- 
old Peter Leko - the rising start of Hungarian 
chess. Then I won a very nervy King’s Indian 
against Lutz. In my third round game with 
Benjamin I missed a decisive stroke on the 
17th move and later tried to extract a win, 
but without success. In the fourth round 
came a difficult draw with Gavrikov, in the 
fifth I managed to win a nervy game against 
Gelfand (who a month before had defeated 
Kramnik in a match, but in Horgen was not 
in his best form), and in the sixth I drew with 
Lautier.
Before the seventh round the race was led 
by Kasparov, Korchnoi, Shirov and Yusupov - 
all on 4Vi out of 6. That day I had White 
against an old acquaintance of mine, Pre­
drag Nikolic.

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
Sf4, when White’s position seemed to us to 
be the more promising.
After Nikolic’s unexpected move for an 
instant I broke into a cold sweat - it is not 
immediately apparent how the threat of 
...cxd4 can be parried. I sank into thought...
9 Wdl!
I was unable to find anything more at­
tractive than the sacrifice of the d4-pawn. If
9 'i’dl?!, then 9...h5l is unpleasant, while 
sacrificing a pawn by 9 -*-d2 cxd4 10 cxd4 
Wxc2 promises fewer hopes of a real advan­
tage: 11 Zcl We4+ 12 Wxe4 dxe4 or
11.. .Wa4l? (Ponkratov-Fedoseev, Taranrog 
2011).
9.. .cxd4
9...^.d7 with the idea of ,.JLa4 (Leko-llles- 
cas, Ubeda 1997) is more cautious, or 9-b6

piad 2008).
10 cxd4 Wc3+ 11 Jtd2 Wxd4 12 ^')f3 We4+ 
13 £e2
Here I already felt comfortable: the posi­
tion is quite an open one, Black’s king is 
misplaced and he has problems with his 
development - it is clear that with his poten­
tially powerful dark-square bishop, White 
has excellent compensation for the pawn. It 
was the turn of my opponent to think: how 
to neutralise White’s growing initiative?
13.. .b6!
With the obvious intention of ...jLa6. In­
tuitively Nikolic hit on the best move. Two 
months later he thed against me the jaunty

gxh6?! 16 JLxh6+ 4g8 (I6...&e8? 17 £g7) 17 
Sbl! he was unable to overcome the chronic 
problems with his king and rook on h8, and 
he resigned on the 30th move (Paris (rapid) 
1994). Things are less clear after I5...£*xf3+ 
16 gxf3 We5 17 hxg7+ &xg7 or the Informa- 
tor suggestion 15-f6 16 hxg7+ l£,xg7, but 
the main thing was that the position was to 
my taste and I felt very much at home.
14 0-0 (or 14 c4 i.a6!) 14—&a6
Black seems to be okay: he will exchange 
the light-square bishops and gradually 
complete his development. If White does not 
devise something, his activity will simply 
peter out.
15 c4l
Pawns no longer count - it is important to 
open lines for the attack (at the same time 
White gets rid of his weaknesses). Very 
interesting tactical play commences.
15...£)bc6
15...J.XC4! 16 ji.xc4 dxc4 was safer, for 
example:
1) 
17 &b4 £sbc6 18 £d6 (Stohl) I8...b5 19 
Zel Wd3, and here the variations show that
68

White’s activity is sufficient only to regain 
the sacrificed pawns;
2) 
17 £>g5 #d3 18 H is, when l8...1f5 19 
Sfcl! or I8...1g6 19 #f3 still retains the 
intensity of the battle, whereas after I8...g6

suggestion 21 lg5(?!) If5  22 Sfcl is unfa­
vourable on account of 22...£ibc6! 23 Sxc4

24 Sxc4 ld 3 ' 25 Sxc6 Sh5) 23...£ixe5 24 
Sc7 £id3, etc., and therefore all that remains 
for White is to give perpetual check - 21 
jLh6+ Sxh6 22 £>e8+ &h7 23 £>f6+.
Thus 8 h4 does not promise more than a 
draw. Analysis shows that after 15...^bc6 
the evaluation of the position also remains 
within the bounds of dynamic equilibrium, 
but White nevertheless holds the initiative 
and there are more pitfalls for Black to avoid. 
16 £ig5 (I made my moves confidently, 
although strictly by intuition)
I6...#xe5!
Again the best choice! After l6...#xh4 pre­
viously only 17 cxd5 ^.xe2 18 #xe2 was 
considered - here Black defends by l8...£ixd5 
(I8...exd5?! is worse in view of 19 g3! #c4 20

#h5 or 21 g3 #xg5 22 i.xf4 #d8 23 Se3 g5! 
White has no more than decent compensa­
tion for his material deficit.
However, in 2012 the computer found the 
far stronger move 17 Sell.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
17 Eel #f6
18 £h5!
A strong move, which obviously disturbed 
Nikolic: the bishop avoids being exchanged. 
18 cxd5 ^.xe2 19 #xe2 £sxd5 20 Eacl £ice7 
looked too harmless.
18.. .g6 19 cxd5?l
The immediate 19 ji.g4l was more accu­

achieving an obvious advantage after

21 Sxe6 #f5 22 £b4 &g8 23 £xe7 Se8 24

20 # c l ^>g7 21 ji.f3 with sharp play and full 
compensation for the two pawns.
19.. .exd5
The only way: 19-£ixd5?! 20 ^.g4l (but 
not the Informator suggestion 20 Eel in

still play on the black king’s nerves.

22 i.g5 #d6 23 #f3+ &e8 24 Eacl and wins.
But the accurate 20..JLc8! (insisting on the 
exchange of bishops) would have parried the 
direct threats: 21 £e2 h6 22 £>f3 &g7 or 21 
Eel h6 22 i.xc8 (22 i.c3? d4 23 £xc8 hxg5l)
22...Exc8, and since 23 1.C3?! d4 24 £se4 
WeS! favours Black (Stohl), White is forced to 
seek chances with 23 £rf3 Ed8 (if 23...d4, 
then 24 g4l *g7 25 ^.xh6+! or 24...#d6 25 
^.c3l)24^.c3 d4 25^.al.
21 £* 6+!
An intuitive, one could say Tal-like piece 
sacrifice. I realised that Black still had con­
siderable defensive resources, but White is 
not taking any particular risk - he obtains 
some amazing tactical possibilities.
21...fxe6 22 Exe6 #f7
22...#g7? does not work in view of 23

With time-tTouble approaching, Nikolic 
cracks under the burden of a lengthy de­

aggression was 33-.Ze6! 34 WbS (34 #g3 
Se4l) 34-Se8 35 #d6 Se6 with equality.

is correct, although after 36 #b8! White can 
continue fishing in troubled waters.

But this is indeed the decisive mistake. 
Nikolic fails to find what was now the only

A very complicated game and, for pre­
computer times, one of high quality. After it I 
became the sole leader, but in the next 
round I drew quickly with Korchnoi, and I
was caught by Shirov. We each had 6 out of 
8, with Korchnoi and Yusupov on 5V2.
In the ninth round came the highly im­
portant ‘duel of the leaders’ with Alexey 
Shirov, and I was fortunate to be able to 
carry out an amazing positional exchange 
sacrifice, which to this day is not suggested 
by a single computer!

A typical undermining move. At that time 
they also tried 14 g3 £>d7 15 £sce3 0-0 16 h4

or 
17-£>b6! (Shirov). However, as it later tran­

far stronger: I6...£sxf6 17 ®xa4+ #d7

White’s advantage is slight, but 16 £sxf6+! is
correct (cf. the previous note). 15-0-0 16

White some advantage (Zagrebelny-Gagarin,

logical with the ideas of l6..JLg5 17 £sf5,
16.. .£sc5 17 Sb4(a2), and 16...0-0 17 h4l. But 
back in Novgorod I conceived the idea of an 
unusual exchange sacrifice, which is possi­
ble after 16 2b4 £>c5 (l6..JLc6?! 17 2c4! is 
worse). After making my move, I froze in 
expectation - and, fortunately for me, Shirov 
quickly moved his knight.
16.. .£sc5?!
After the game Alexey declared this move 
to be virtually the decisive mistake, although 
this was more of an emotional reaction. To 
be honest, I did not see anything special for 
White after l6...2b8, and the cool-headed
16.. .2.7! was even stronger (Erdogdu- 
Halkias, Antalya 2001).
17 2xb7H
This move, which stunned my opponent, 
afforded me great satisfaction: a pure 
exchange sacrifice merely for domination of 
the light squares and the restriction of the 
‘bad’ knight. However, if one digs deeper, it 
transpires that Black’s bishop is also ‘bad’, 
and in general the coordination of his pieces
74

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
is poor - this is why it is so hard for him to 
cope at the board with the problems that 
have suddenly arisen.
17.. .^xb7 18 b4
While Shirov was considering his reply, I 
strolled about the stage, and the leader of 
the ‘B’ tournament, grandmaster Julian 
Hodgson, came up to me and asked: ‘Didn’t 
they teach you that a rook is stronger than a 
bishop?’ I replied: ‘That day I wasn’t at the 
lesson!'.
18.. .!,g5

19.. ~&xe3, but the knight can go to c4 from

and wins) 20 h4! 0-0 21 g3, etc.
19 £ia3! 0-0 20 £k4a5
A natural desire to open the a-file for the 
rook. The suicidal 20...f5(?) should be met 
not by my Informator suggestion 21 itd3(?), 
but simply 21 exf5i, since 21...flxf5 is bad 
because of 22 h4! .&.xh4 23 #g4 itxf2+ 24

h4!? deserved consideration. But I hur­
ried to mobilise my forces - another para­
doxical feature of the exchange sacrifice is 
that for the moment White is even behind in 
development!
2l...axb4 22 cxb4 #b 8?!
Dangerously moving away from the king- 
side. Black vacates the d8-square for his 
knight or bishop and brings the queen to the 
a-file, to have the possibility of launching it 
into White’s position. But this active plan 
proves just as pointless as the passive de­
fence 22...Sb8?! 23 h4 Jth6 (Stohl), in view of 
the paralysing 24^cb6!.
22...Ia2 23 0-0 #c8 was better, with the 
idea of ...#66-116 or 22..JLh6 23 0-0 #g5, 
although in both variations after 24 g3 
White is not risking anything and at the 
minimum he maintains dynamic equality.
23 h4i?
If 23 0-0 I did not like 23...£>d8, for exam­
ple: 24 h4 (24 £>cb6 Sa7 is equal) 24...^.h6 25

£id7 f5! 28 #xf5 Sxf5 29 <^xb8 Sf8 with a 
roughly equal endgame. Therefore I decided 
to set my opponent a tricky problem: where 
to move the bishop - to h6 or to d8, taking 
away a square from the ill-starred knight?
However, Black’s error would have been 
more clearly emphasised by 23 <£>cb6! Sa2, 
and now not 24 £>d7? (Stohl) 24..~&.d2+! 25

An oversight! Alas, I attacked the rook 
immediately, but the only way to win was by 
the preparatory 27 .&b5! (what a difference 
there is in the strength of the bishops!), for 
example: 27.~Sc2 28 £>d7 Ea8 29 £>e7+ *h8

that 27...2a8 would nevertheless have lost to
28 £>7b6 - 28...2b8(d8)? 29 £sc4! or 28...2f8?
29 ^.b5l, obtaining the position with 27

But in the computer era once again the 
only defence was found - 28...1fa3! (Stohl) 
29 £sxa8 2xd3, for example: 30 £sf6+ <^f8 31 
£sxh7+ &e7 32 #e2 2d2 33 #b5 #xa8 34

and everything reduces to perpetual check.
Another recommendation by Stohl is also 
interesting - 28 J.C41? ®d8 29 #f5. How­
ever, he attaches a question mark to
29...#d4, assuming that after 30 £>7b6 2 al 
31 ^>h2! White wins, although here also 
Black has a pretty way to draw: 3i. .£se6! 32

perpetual check.
28 £sxf8 &xf8
29 b5l (the key move, killing Black’s potential 
activity) 29—#a3
If 29...£se6, then 30 b61. Soon after the 
game I recommended 29...#d4 - and incor­
rectly! After this both 30 ii.e2l (Stohl) and the 
thematic 30 #f5! &e8 31 #c8 #c5 32 £>c7+ 
&e7 33 b6! are decisive.
30 #f5!
It would appear that Shirov overlooked 
this move, enabling White to avoid the 
exchange of queens. The squares c8 and d7 
and the h7-pawn are all attacked. With 
material equal, White has an overwhelming 
advantage in the quality of his pieces. At last 
the target of the attack becomes the black 
king.

Another paradox: at the start of the game 
White was the clear exchange down, and at 
the end he is the exchange and a pawn to 
the good! Black has given up, one after the 
other, both of his rooks for two minor pieces. 
And now the outcome is decided by the 
inclusion in the attack of the sole surviving 
rook.

Or 38 ^xd6!, but I played simply to keep 
the material.
I think that this game is one of the best 
from my entire chess career. It is rare to see a 
positional exchange sacrifice without any 
concrete tactical play and with a deep 
strategic idea.
I now had 7 out of 9, but the competitive 
intrigue was not exhausted, since Yusupov, 
who played excellently in this tournament, 
defeated Korchnoi and remained just half a 
point behind. The destiny of first place was 
finally decided by my game with Artur 
Yusupov in the tenth, penultimate round. I 
was able to employ some interesting ana­
lytical preparation in the Scotch, which led 
to a colourful finish.

ence has suggested that it is best to play
7..JLd4!, not waiting for the leap of the 
knight.
8 £sa4l?
This, one of my key discoveries in the 
Scotch Game, was a 1993 match novelty 
(instead of the previous 8 ®f4 or 8 ii.d3). 
White plays his knight to the edge of the 
board, in order to drive the black bishop 
from its strong position and comfortably 
complete his development. His aim is to 
extinguish Black’s temporary activity and try 
to convert his extra pawn on the kingside (as 
in the ‘Berlin Wall’ or the Exchange Variation 
of the Ruy Lopez).
8...Sd8 9 i-d3 i-d4 10 0-0 a6
Safeguarding the d4-bishop against the
threat of c2-c3. In the 11th game of our 
match Short played 10...£se7?!, but after 11

14 1i rxd3 Sxd3 15 £sc5 is also unfavourable) 
141i rxa4 bxa415 -&c2 White obtained clearly 
the better endgame.
11 #a5l?
And here is another novelty. In the 17th 
game of the match with Short I chose the 
insipid 11 £sc3 £se7 12 £se2 ^.b6 13 'Bfy and 
after 13...£sg6 14 'Sfxf6 gxf6 15 £sg3 I 
achieved a minute advantage, but in the 
event of 13...1Hfxf4 14 £sxf4 -a.c8 it would 
have been even more symbolic. After that 
game I couldn’t help feeling that you can’t 
play chess that way (£sc3-a4-c3?l), and I soon 
devised 11 #a5 - an attempt to cut the 
Gordian knot at one stroke.
It would seem risky to play a second piece 
to the edge of the board, especially the 
queen. But with gain of tempo White opens 
the path of the cl-bishop, and in view of the 
threats of Wxc7 and ^.g5 Black can no longer 
play on general grounds. However, the main 
thing is that to avoid ending up in an un­
pleasant position, he is forced to sacrifice a 
pawn. From the frown on Yusupov’s pensive 
face it was evident that this was all clear to 
him...

White is better after ll.-WeS 12 #xe5

Black lost on time.
A draw at the finish with Miles completed 
my performance in the tournament - first 
place by a margin of one and a half points. 
‘Zurich helped me to forget London’, I de­
clared on my return to Moscow. ‘I was 
especially successful in the games with 
Shirov and Yusupov, which were exception­
ally important in the competitive sense. For 
the sake of them alone it was worth going to 
Zurich.’
Curiously, this tournament was arbitrarily 
divided into three stages (rounds 1-4, 5-8 
and 9-11), in each of which a prestigious jury 
(Dr. Wirth, grandmasters Hort and Kinder- 
mann) awarded special prizes tor the best 
games, and I won two of these - for my wins 
against Nikolic and Yusupov. And then my 
game with Shirov was voted the best in the 
6lst volume of Informator.
Before the end of the year I appeared in 
three more events. In November in Paris I 
won the fourth and concluding stage of the 
Intel Rapidplay Grand Prix, in Lyon I played 
three games for the Sarajevo team Bosna in 
the European Club Cup (+l-l=i), and I took 
a very active part in saving the 31st World 
Chess Olympiad, which Greece had suddenly 
withdrawn from staging.
These events took place against the back­
ground of the continuing schism in the 
Russian Chess Federation. The vice-president 
Yuri Averbakh recalls:
'At a critical moment for international 
chess, Makarov, the recently elected president 
of the Russian Chess Federation, and alto­
82

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
gether unexpectedly the world champion 
Kasparov came to the aid of FIDE, thereby 
dispelling rumours that he was intent on 
destroying FIDE. We in fact wanted to dem­
onstrate that we were aiming not for a 
conflict, but for collaboration, and were 
ready to do everything possible to help the 
development of world chess (although six 
months before this the previous leaders of the 
Federation, Bebchuk and Karpov, had sent 
FIDE a fax with the assertion that our organi­
sation had set itself the objective of destroy­
ing FIDE!). The FIDE board of directors headed 
by Campomanes greeted our proposal with 
delight and unanimously decided that, firstly, 
it would recognise our federation as the only 
one acting legitimately on the territory of 
Russia, and, secondly, it would entrust us 
with the staging of the Olympiad and the 
Congress at the previously planned dates.’
The Olympiad, which was organised in 
less than two months, took place in the 
gigantic Kosmos Hotel in Moscow (30 No­
vember - 16 December 1994). Those were 
incredibly intensive days. I still don’t under­
stand how I was able to combine my daily 
administrative and political chess functions 
with successful play in the tournament.
My three strong-willed wins at the finish 
- against Azmaiparashvili, Short and the 
‘new German’ Yusupov - helped our harmo­
nious team again, as two years earlier in 
Manila, to win Olympiad ‘gold’: 1. Russia-1 - 
371/2 out of 56; 2. Bosnia and Herzegovina - 
35; 3. Russia-2 and 4. England - 34V2; 5-7. 
Bulgaria, Holland and USA - 34 etc. (alto­
gether - 124 teams). The winning team 
comprised Kasparov {FP/i out of 10), Kramnik 
(8 out of ll), Bareev (51/2 out of 10), Dreev 
(51/2 out of 8), reserves Tiviakov (6’/2 out of 9) 
and Svidler (5'A out of 8).
Intuitively I felt that things were not right 
with the world championship, and I took the
opportunity to make a truce with Campo­
manes. At the FIDE Congress which took 
place at that time we signed a Declaration of 
Cooperation between FIDE and the PCA, 
according to which in the final of both 
qualifying series a ‘unifying’ match for the 
title was envisaged (the full text of this 
historic document, which, alas, was not put 
into practice, was published in Kasparov vs. 
Karpov 1988-2009).
From the perspective of the 21st century 
Yuri Vasiliev called 1994 a fateful one for 
chess: ‘The intrigue, at the centre of which 
were the key figures of that time - Kasparov, 
the Russian Chess Federation President 
Makarov and the FIDE President Campo­
manes, who was unexpectedly re-elected for 
a new term, gave birth the following year to a 
phantom by the name of llyumzhinov. The 
victory in Moscow proved to be a pyrrhic 
victory for Kasparov.’

Memorial, 12-23 April 1995): l. Kasparov -

Early in 1995 the qualifying Candidates 
series concluded for both versions of the 
world title - FIDE and PCA. In the FIDE semi­
final matches in February Kamsky crushed 
Salov (s'h-x'/i), and Karpov overcame Gel- 
fand (6-3). Now in the principal FIDE match 
Karpov had to meet Kamsky. But in March 
Kamsky also had to battle with Anand in the 
final match of the PCA Candidates. If Gata 
had won, a unique situation would have 
arisen: one contender challenging two 
champions! But Anand prevailed (FP/i-AVi), 
and he thereby became my next opponent in
83

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
a match for the world championship.
Therefore our encounter in Riga at the Tal 
Memorial in April was awaited with height­
ened interest and was christened a ‘recon­
naissance’ and a 'dress rehearsal’. It was 
with this tournament that eleven grand­
masters of the Professional Chess Associa­
tion, in addition to the Intel Rapidplay Grand 
Prix, began contesting the PCA Grand Prix 
Super-classic, which consisted of three 
stages: Riga (spring), Novgorod (early sum­
mer), and Horgen (late autumn).
At the drawing of lots I received an un­
usual gift - ‘No.l’, thanks to which I was free 
in the first round, which coincided with my 
32nd birthday. In the second round I quickly 
defeated Timman with White (cf. Game 
No.62, note to Black’s 7th move), and in the 
third I even more quickly gained a draw with 
Black against Kramnik in a quiet Italian 
Game. Kramnik had the reputation of being 
an expert on the closed games, but in the 
mid-1990s he regularly played l  e4 against 
me, and I replied either 1...C5 or l...e5.
After the initial rounds a leading quartet 
emerged: Anand and Ivanchuk - 2'/i out of 
3, Kramnik - 2, Kasparov - l'/i out of 2. I 
need hardly explain the competitive impor­
tance of my game with Vishy Anand in the 
fourth round. Before it I experienced a great 
emotional surge and I even exclaimed: ‘I feel 
in the mood to sacrifice! I will dedicate this 
game to Tali’. And I did indeed create a 
spectacular miniature.

4b4l?
My first employment in ‘classical’ play of 
the ancient Evans Gambit! Makarychev and I 
began analyzing it back in 1992, but more 
for pleasure. On one occasion I chose it 
against my will - in the first game of my 
thematic gambit match with Short (London 
(rapid) 1993) and then for many months I 
hesitated: could it be played in a top-rank 
tournament? And now I thought: this is a 
tournament in memory of Tal - and I must, I 
really must play the gambit.
Thus, by the irony of fate, this preparation 
by Sergey and myself saw the light only at 
the end of the ‘Makarychev era’. We tried to 
introduce new content into this 19th cen­
tury opening, although a residue of strategic 
unsoundness remained: White gives up a 
pawn in a position where Black has not yet 
broken any of the rules.

his mobile pawn centre) 10...#a5 or
10...#d8, as in the thematic Kasparov-Short 
game, where I gradually seized the initiative, 
carried out a pretty combination, but blun­
dered in time-trouble and Black miracu­
lously escaped.
The move 7 .&e2, with which White de­
clines to return the pawn and insists on a 
gambit, would appear to contradict the idea 
of Captain Evans (an attack on the f7-point), 
but Black’s knight has gone to a5, weakening 
his centre. White does not aim to give a 
quick mate, but wants to extract positional 
benefits from the opening of lines and his 
lead in development.
7-.exd4
A sounder continuation emerged from 
correspondence play in the 1980s-1990s:
7.. .d6 (in tum Black insists on returning the 
pawn; not 7...£)f6? 8 dxe5 £)xe4 9 #a4) 8 
#34+ c6 9 dxe5 dxe5 10 £ixe5 £)f6, although 
the position after 110-0 seemed to me to be 
quite playable.
8 #xd4!
One of the underestimated ideas, giving 
the play an original direction: the sudden 
attack by the queen on the g7-pawn creates 
psychological comfort for the opponent. 
Weaker is 8 0-0 
9 e5 £>e4 10 #xd4 f5 or
8 cxd4 £tf6, also known at that time from 
correspondence play.
8.. .®f6
The most natural reply. There are several 
ways of defending the g7-pawn, but each of 
them promises some problems for Black. 
Thus if he delays his development with
85

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
8.-^8?! or 8...f6 9 0-0 White has obvious 
compensation for the pawn.
Far more interesting is the counter­
sacrifice of the pawn (before the game I did 
not even consider this!):
1) 8...d6!? 9 Ifxg? JLf6 10 VHtqS, and if 
lO-.We?, then not 11 0-0?! (Shirov-Timman,

10.. .£sd5 11 Wg3 g6
Again the most natural reply. An ex­
change sacrifice also deserved consideration 
- 11...O-O 12 JLh6 g6 13 iLxf8 (to my jaunty 
Informator suggestion 13 h4 there is the

14.. .£sb6 15 £sbd2 d6 with a tense fight.
12 0-0 (if 12 JLh6, then l2..JLf8 or 12...d6)
12.. .£sb6?!
Here 12...0-0 was more natural, and if 13

14.. .£sb6 15 *S^c3 d6 (Ponomariov-Daniliuk,

,&xf6 16 ,&g5 Sxe2 17 £sc3 .&xg5 18 £sxg5 
Se8! and ...d7-d6, relieving the situation. 
Therefore first 13 c4! £sb6(db4) 14 £>c3 is 
more accurate.
13 c4?!
Black’s hesitation would have been em­
phasised by 13 .&h6! (Chandler) 13...Af8 
(I3...d6?! 14 ^.b5! or 13...d5?! 14 Sdl! is 
worse) 14 ^.f4 (Stohl) or 14 .&g5 .&e7 15 a4, 
retaining pressure.
13.. .d6
After 13...£sa4, suggested by me in Infor­
mator, 14 JLh6 d6 15 Bel! is strong, with an 
enduring initiative. And 13...0-0 14 £k3 
would have led to a position from the note 
to Black’s 12th move.
14 Sdl?!
14 ^.h6 or 14 £fc3 was better, with suffi­
cient compensation for the pawn. However, 
Anand promptly returns the favour.
14.. .^d7?
A turning-point. 14...^.e6? 15 c5! was also 
bad, but now was the time for the paradoxi­
cal move 14...£sa4! (Stohl), not only prevent­
ing c4-c5, but also hampering the develop­
ment of White’s queenside (now 15 .&h6 is 
unfavourable because of I5...f6!).
15 .&h6!
At last! I think that Vishy believed implic­
itly in the safety of his position and obvi­
ously underestimated the sacrifice of a 
second pawn. After any capture on e5 White 
will have very powerful compensation.

Anand was hoping for 17 .&.g7?! Jtf6! 18 
JsLxh8 JsLxh8 19 ®c3 ®d7! with excellent 
compensation for the exchange, but, as my 
new trainer Yuri Dokhoian rightly remarked, 
it would be a pity to give up such a fine 
bishop for the inactive black rook. And 
Mikhail Gurevich added: ‘Garry prefers to 
bring up his last reserves. His pieces slice 
through the opponent’s position like a knife 
through butter.’
The immediate breakthrough 17 c5l?, de­
nying Black the possible reply 17-.^d7, also 
deserved consideration.
17...f6
‘In terrible time-trouble (!) Vishy tries to 
erect something resembling a fortress. But 
this looks very passive. It would appear that, 
in the given specific instance, logic (his 
strongest side) led down the brilliant Indian
player’, writes Gurevich. ‘l7...iLh4 18 Wie3 
± e6, developing the queenside, was more 
resilient.’ However, after 19 c5l Black’s 
position collapses like a house of cards.
17...®d7 looks more resilient, for exam­
ple: 18 £ie4 ii.f8 19 ®c3 f6 20 Jtf4l (my 
Informator variation) 20..Jtg7 21 c5l (Stohl)
21...0-0! 22 cxd6 c6 23 Sabi, and White has 
excellent compensation for the pawn in the 
form of his mighty passed pawn, or 18

position as unclear) 20 J.e3! c6 (20...£ie4?!

dangerous attack on the king caught in the 
centre, although in both cases there is still 
much play in the position.
18 c5! £f7?!
This merely aggravates Black’s difficulties. 
He should have developed his queen’s 
bishop, although each of the possible moves 
had its drawbacks and his king would have 
remained under an unrelenting attack:
1) l8...jLd7 (Stohl) 19 cxd6 cxd6 20 Sabi!

of our match will depend on how often 
Kasparov employs the Evans Gambit.’ And I 
predicted: ‘It is probable that now this 
opening will begin to occur frequently, and 
much will be determined simply by the 
method of exhaustive searching.’ And, 
although I was very proud of this win in the 
style of the old masters, in the match with 
Anand I played only 3 i-b5 or 3 d4. But the 
sweeping manner of play in the main, 10th 
game (Game No.19) evoked ‘Evans-style’ 
ideas.
After this I reached 2y/i out of 3, while Iv­
anchuk was leading with 3Vz out of 4. But 
then he slowed down and drew all his re­
maining games, including the one with me 
in the sixth round, after holding out with

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
difficulty as Black in a King’s Indian. I man­
aged, not without a degree of luck, to win 
with Black against Yusupov and Vaganian, 
and also in the tenth round with White 
against the ‘home’ player Kengis, an old 
opponent of mine in junior tournaments 
(just think: our first encounter took place 22 
years earlier). This brought me to ‘plus five' 
and first place.
Anand also produced a finishing spurt. As 
a result he finished just half a point behind 
me, so that our duel in the fourth round took 
on the status of the decisive game of the 
tournament.
The chairman of the Tal Memorial organ­
ising committee was the Latvian Prime 
Minister himself, and also present at the 
opening ceremony were the President of the 
country and the Russian ambassador! But, 
alas, the tradition 
of staging 
super- 
toumaments of this standard in Riga was 
not established. The prominent Baltiya Bank, 
the main sponsor, soon collapsed and was 
liquidated...
After Riga and before our match in the 
autumn, Anand played only in two Intel 
Grand Prix knock-out tournaments, whereas 
I twice took part in ‘classical’ events. First 
there was the regular match-toumament in 
Amsterdam (Euwe Memorial, 11-18 May 
1995): 1. Lautier - 4 out of 6; 2. Kasparov - 
31/2; 3. Topalov - 2V2; 4. Piket - 2. It was 
amusing that up to the last round I copied 
the previous year’s results - draw, two wins, 
loss, win, but at the end I contrived to lose to 
Piket and I nevertheless finished behind 
Lautier.
‘The root of the trouble lay in accumu­
lated fatigue and many years of lack of 
training: I was no longer in the habit of 
aiming for an ultra-complicated battle, 
where the price of every move is very high’, I 
declared at that time in an interview. ‘Posi­
tions such as in the game with Piket, where 
in a Griinfeld White had a passed pawn on 
d6, were ones that previously I sensed with 
the tips of my fingers. But now I am commit­
ting crude errors... I have got out of the habit 
of playing with great intensity! This is a 
warning signal, but it has sounded in time. 
Now the main thing is to mobilise myself 
absolutely before the match with Anand.’
From Amsterdam I travelled to Cologne, 
where on 20 May I played two 25-minute 
games with an opponent I had lost to the 
previous year in London - the program 
Genius (1V2-V2). Everything was decided by 
the dramatic first game. In the opening I felt 
extremely feverish 
- the 
‘Amsterdam 
wounds’ were still painful, and all around 
there was an incredible hullabaloo. On the 
18th move, in a roughly equal position, I 
made an inexcusable oversight, leading to 
the loss of a pawn. The machine could take 
either a ‘good’, healthy pawn, or a ‘bad’, 
doubled one, but leading to an endgame 
with winning chances. Fortunately, Genius 
grabbed the ‘good’ pawn (that was how it 
was programmed), and I immediately cre­
ated threats to the black king. After a couple 
of poor moves the machine came under a 
‘mortal’ pin and could no longer avoid 
defeat.
Alexander Roshal: ‘A certain perplexity - 
why has Kasparov been obviously under­
performing in some of the recent events? - 
may be replaced by understanding, if you 
glance if only briefly at the champion’s 
schedule during this period: Tal Memorial in 
Riga, simuT in the British Embassy, active 
participation in a congress of the Russian 
Chess Federation, the 'Kremlin stars’ tourna­
ment, flights - first to Noyabrsk (1200 km. 
further north than Tyumen), then to Orel, a 
simuT in the Central Chess Club for veterans 
of the Great Patriotic 
War, 
a 
blitz-

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
tournament in the same place, the Euwe 
Memorial in Amsterdam, a mini-match with 
computers in Cologne, the PCA super- 
tournament in Novgorod... On 5 May at 
Moscow airport an excited Kasparov was met 
by his chauffeur, who said something to him. 
The champion turned to his companions and 
sombrely said in a changed voice: "A few 
hours ago Botvinnik died”. To win constantly 
with such a way of life is almost impossible.’
Great Play
International Tournament in Novgorod (26 
May - 5 June 1995): 1. Kasparov - 6'/i out of 
9; 2-5. Ehlvest, Short, Ivanchuk and Topalov - 
5V2; 6. Kramnik - 5; 7. Timman - 4; 8. Gulko 
- 3; 9. Yusupov - V/r, 10. Vaganian - 2.
The basic line-up for the second, Nov­
gorod stage of the PCA Grand Prix Super­
classic was the same as in Riga, except that 
Anand was replaced by Topalov.
‘Kasparov had plenty of organisational 
and purely chess concerns. His collapse at the 
finish of the Amsterdam tournament, when 
he lost two games out of three, did not allow 
Garry any peace', testifies Yuri Vasiliev. ‘In a 
telephone conversation with me the cham­
pion declared that in Novgorod he would 
definitely play far better than in Amsterdam. 
And he said this persistently and forcefully. 
But it is one thing to say this, and another 
thing to do it.’
At the start, after employing a fresh idea 
in the King’s Indian Defence, I finally 
achieved an ‘historic’ victory over Gulko - 
the only grandmaster in the world who had 
a score of +3=2 against me. In the second 
round, alas, I again was unable to do any­
thing with White against Ivanchuk, who for 
the first time chose the Caro-Kann Defence 
against my 1 e4. The d4-d5 breakthrough 
promised an advantage, but in the end it led
merely to simplification and an equal end­
game. A difficult game!
The next day I was paired against Artur 
Yusupov, who had begun the tournament 
with two losses with Black and now was not 
averse to recouping his losses with the white 
pieces, at the same time improving the score 
of our individual meetings. But I wanted to 
send a ‘black spot’ to my opponent in the 
forthcoming match - Yusupov was one of 
Anand’s trainers.

...£sb6-a4, with counterplay compensating 
for tbe defect in tbe pawn structure.

Vusupov cherishes aggressive ideas, re­
jecting equality after 14(13) £sxd7 and 
intending to open tbe h-file. This imparts an 
interesting dynamic nature to tbe play: 
despite tbe absence of tbe queens, tbe 
position is effectively one from tbe middle- 
game, with both sides trying to attack.
14.. .£>b6!?
A double-edged reply, creating a ‘Dvoret­

our official meetings: +1 1 -1 =9.
The following day I had Black against the 
rising star of Bulgarian chess, the 20-year- 
old Veselin Topalov. Despite his youth, he 
was already well known for his bold, un­
compromising style, and he had beaten me

at the 1994 Moscow Olympiad. But from 
Amsterdam 1995 the scores began to tum 
the other way, and our final balance in 
‘classical’ play was +9-3=13 in my favour. It is 
curious that all my losses against Topalov, 
including the last, tragic one (Game No.lOO) 
were suffered as Black in the Sicilian. How­
ever, in it I won even more games!

Not 18 e5?! Wc7. Topalov has played the 
opening well, acting in roughly the same 
way as in his Amsterdam game with Lautier: 
ideas of a direct attack combined with 
positional motifs. It is not so easy for Black to 
create counterplay.
I8...b4
If lS-Wcy, then 19 jLf6! is unpleasant, 
exchanging the dark-squared bishops and 
making it difficult for Black to defend his de­
pawn. I8...2e8 19 h 5 .&f8 involves the loss of 
a tempo, and White can exploit this, not by 
launching a storm against the king’s fortress 
(20 g6 fxg6 21 hxg6 h6 22 f4 # 08!), but by 
simply doubling or even tripling heavy 
pieces on the d-file - 20 Sd3l, etc.
19 axb4 Sxb4 20 S g 2
A subtle positional move: the rook covers 
the second rank and is ready to double on 
the d-file. But perhaps the immediate 20 
JLc5!? is even better: 20...Sc4 21 jLa3 VHc7 22 
Sd3 .&a8?! 23 h5 Sb8 24 Sgdl (Vokarev-
Lastin, Moscow 1999), or 22...Sb8 23 Sgdl 
(Komeev-Pogorelov, San Sebastian 2000).
20.. JLa8
With the intention of ..Wb8. After
20.. JLc6?I 21 £sa2! Sb5 (2l...Sc4? 22 b3, 
Milov-Vogt, Bundesliga 2005) 22 JLxg7! 
<&xg7 23 WC3+ ‘igS 2 4 lrxc6 Wj8 25 c3 Black 
has no compensation for the pawn. 20...a5 
21 ^.c5! is also insufficient - I recommended
21.. .dxc5(?) 22 Sxd8 Sxd8 'with good com­
pensation for the queen’, but after 23 h5! 
White has a fearfully strong attack.

Again 21 ^.cSl? deserved consideration:

Sgd2 #a5 23 £xd6 £xd6 24 Sxd6 Sxb2+ 25 
<&,xb2 5b8+ is illusory in view of 26 ®b5!, 
when Black remains the exchange down) 22 
Sgd2! (at that time I also judged 22 e5 d5 23 
b3 to be in White’s favour, but after
23.. ..6XC5 24 'V/y.cS Wb8! Black is okay) 
22.Jirb8! (the only way: after my earlier
22.. .5d7(?) there is 23 ^.xd6! and e4-e5), and 
now 23 .&xd6?! is premature on account of
23.. .5xb2+ 24 &C1 Sb7l with equality (25 
^.xb8?? ^.a3 mate!), but after 23 ^.a3! the 
initiative is with White. However, after 
thinking for some 20 minutes, Topalov 
apparently decided that more could be 
extracted from the position.

king’s position has been weakened by the

probably in trouble. 22...Sb8! 23 Sgd2 a4! is

25 Sd4
Actively preventing ...a5-a4. A more com­
plicated way of fighting for an advantage 
was 25 'A’cll? (not exchanging a pair of 
rooks). Against the two moves suggested by 
me in Informator White has strong replies:
25.. JLc6 26 #f4! or 25...S4b6 26 h6L And if
25.. .#c7, then simply 26 Sgd2, retaining 
pressure.
25.. .e5 26 Sxb4 axb4 27 £sa2! (in order to 
hinder the opponent’s counterplay on the a-
file by an attack on the weak b4- and d6- 
pawns; after 27 £la4 ii.c6 28 £sb2 #c7 Black 
would have become active) 27...#c7l
The opening of the centre - 27...d5? 28 
exd5 ilxd5 - is unfavourable because of 29 
ld2 Ac6 30 f4 e4 31 h6 or 30...f6 31 gxf6 
gxf6 32 h6.

Accuracy is now demanded of White. If 28

35 Se3 #a7l 36 #d2 gxh6, etc.
28.. .^f8!
This move deserves an exclamation mark 
for psychology. By bringing up his king to the 
defence of the d6-pawn, Black provokes 
immediate activity by White on the kingside. 
Veselin was visibly perplexed - apparently 
he was reckoning on 28..JLc6?l 29 g6! or
28.. .5b6 29 g6! (in Informator for some 
reason I judged 29 Sd2 iLb7 30 #c4 to be in 
White’s favour, although after 30...#xc4 31 
bxc4 f6 the endgame is equal) 29~fxg6 30 
hxg6 h6 31 Hd2 ^.b7 32 #e3 with some 
advantage.
29 g6?l
This is typical Topalov - he tries to expose 
the opponent’s king, even at the cost of
97

Carry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
giving him an outside passed pawn. But - he 
advances the wrong pawn! The accurate 29 
h6! (not the Informator line 29 Sd2 &e7 30 
&b2 in view of BO-.^cS! 31 c3 bxc3+ 32 
£ ixc3 Jlc6 or 32...h6 with equality) 29...g6 30 
Sd2 &e7 31 f4l or 30...2b6 31 f4l (when
31.. .exf4? is not possible on account of 32 
1B,d4!) would have enabled White to main­
tain his fading initiative.
29.. .fxg6 30 hxg6 h6
31 f4?!
But here this is going too far: Black is not 
weakened on the long diagonal and his g7- 
pawn is defended. White plays for mate and 
effectively bums his boats behind him, by 
activating the sleeping bishop on a8. It was 
better to make this move later, with the 
black king on e7: 31 Sd2 &e7 32 f4l? (if 32 
&b2 or 32 £)cl, then 32...1i rc5! and ...±c6)
32.. .exf4 33 1^4 2g8 (33...*f8 34 £ixb4) 34 
^21, regaining the pawn with approximate 
equality.
31.. .exf4 32 S f 2 &g8 33 Sxf4 tfcs!
Virtually Black’s first active move - and 
immediately a threat (34...'i,gl+). The situa­
tion has changed: now the e4- and g6- 
pawns are weak, the black king has rushed 
back, and it is now White who has problems. 
But Topalov sensed the danger too late. 
34 Sfl
The ending looks alarming for White after 
34 Sf5 1^1+ 35 &b2 Wxg6 36 e5l 1^6! 37 
IfxdB IfxdB 38 exd6 g5l. I suggested 34 £)cl 
as being the best practical chance, but in 
Informator I also gave the correct reply -
34...Se8!. And, indeed, after 35 ^ 6  ^ 8 !?  36 
tfxde ^.xe4 37 £)d3 2d8 381i rxb4 Jb<g6 with 
the passed pawns on opposite wings the 
bishop is stronger than the knight, and 
Black's chances are rather better. The move 
in the game is most probably no worse than 
these continuations.
34—Wb5!
The incautious 34...1i re5?! would have run 
into 35 lt4 +  &h8 (35 -d5?! 36 #c5 l rxe4? 
37 #a7! and wins) 361i rxb4!, when Black has 
only equality - 36.Jire8! 37 WxdB jLxe4.
34...2c8 was not bad, but psychologically the 
offer to exchange queens proved far more 
unpleasant for the opponent.
35 2cl?!
A difficult choice. 35 ^ 3 ?  was bad in view 
of 35—WeS!, both defending and attacking 
the weaknesses on e4 and g6. 35 2f7?! (35 
2gl! is better) 35...1i rxd3 36 cxd3 .&c6 with 
the threat of ...Ji.e8 or 35 WxbS?! Sxb5 36 
2 d l i.xe4 37 2xd6 <&f8 38 Sd4 i.xg6 39 
£ixb4 h5! 40 ^ c l Ji.f5 also does not look 
good, since the endgame is advantageous to 
Black: his pawns advance more quickly, and
98

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
the bishop is more mobile than the knight. 
White's attempt to exchange the queens in a 
more favourable version (35.~#xd3?l 36 
cxd3, not allowing the bishop to go to c6) 
leads to a quick rout, though, since Black is 
by no means obliged to go into the end­
game.
35...#e5! (pretty pendulum-like oscillations 
by the queen) 36 #c4+ &h8
37 Shi?
A desperate time-trouble trap. 37 £)xb4? 
#xe4 or 37 #c7? Sf8 38 £)xb4 ^.xe4 was 
also hopeless. Only 37 Bel retained saving 
hopes, although after 37...Se8 and ,..^.xe4 
Black would be a sound pawn to the good.
37.. .^.xe4 (it was still possible to lose:
37.. #xe4?? 38 2xh6+ gxh6 39 #f7 fe l+  40 
<£scl and mate) 38 #c7 (not 38 Bxh6+? gxh6 
39 #f7 #g7 or 39#c7 Sb7) 38...Sf8!
Unexpectedly this move, in combination 
with the next one, not only parries the 
attack, but also brings me victory.
39 2xh6+ 4>g8
White’s attack has come to a standstill 
and Black completely dominates - all his 
pieces have taken up attacking positions.
40 £>cl
If 40 Sh4 Black would also have won with
40.. Jk.xc2+! 
(but 
not 
the 
Informator
40.. .^.xg6(?) 41 #04+ d5 because of 42 #d4l
with a draw) 41 #xc2 #el+  and ...#xh4. 40 
Sh7 JLxg6 41 Bhl #e6! (threatening ...#xb3 
and ...2c8) 42 #c4 #xc4 43 bxc4 b3 was also 
depressing for White.
40...JLxc2+!
It is this bishop, which has been waiting in 
ambush, that lands the decisive blow. In view 
of 41 for a long time <4>xc2 2f2+ or 41 #xc2 
gxh6, White resigned (0-1). A very difficult, 
fighting game, with a spectacular finish.
After then scoring a third successive win - 
over Vaganian - I was confidently leading 
the race: Kasparov - 4’A out of 5; Ivanchuk 
and Short - 3I/2. But in the sixth round I had 
a difficult draw with Kramnik, whereas 
Ivanchuk defeated Short and reduced my 
lead to the minimum. After this both lead­
ers, exhausted by the extreme Novgorod 
heat, each made two draws, and now every­
thing was decided by the last, ninth round. 
Ivanchuk was obviously aiming to repeat his 
success of the previous year, when he had 
caught me by winning at the finish, but on 
this occasion he lost to Topalov. I had to be 
satisfied with a draw against Timman, who 
employed an improvement as late as the 
24th move (cf. Game N0.4, note to Black’s 
llth  move), and as a result I took first place, 
a point ahead of my nearest rivals.

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
Yuri Vasiliev: 'The leading role in the tour­
nament was played by the world champion. 
He acted extremely professionally and cre­
ated a number of masterpieces of attack and 
counterattack. His games with Yusupov and 
Topalov were especially impressive. This was 
great play!’
Match with Anand
World Championship Match Kasparov -  
Anand (New York, 10 September - 10 Octo­
ber 1995): 10Vi-7Vi.
Initially it was planned that my match 
with the winner of the PCA cycle would be 
held in Germany - such an offer had been 
made to me during the 1994 Moscow Olym­
piad by the organisers of the Dortmund 
tournaments. The venue had already been 
selected and all the conditions agreed. 
However, the German Chess Union, who 
were one of the Federations unhappy with 
the outcome of the FIDE Congress in Moscow 
and the conditions of the proposed agree­
ment with the PCA, effectively announced a 
boycott of the match. Early in 1995 the 
Dortmund organisers suddenly made a 
reverse move - they held a press conference, 
at which they besmirched the PCA and 
announced their intention to hold a super- 
toumament in the summer with the partici­
pation of ‘the world champion Karpov’. An 
amusing detail: when in the autumn of 
2000 their favourite Kramnik became world 
champion, they immediately ‘forgot’ from 
whom he had taken the title...
But, despite the critical situation, all the 
same the match would have taken place, 
since the main sponsor of the PCA was 
interested in it. Then, in the June days of the 
second, New York stage of the Intel Rapid- 
play Grand Prix, the Mayor of New York, 
Rudolf Giuliani, suddenly displayed extraor­
dinary enthusiasm. The CTazy idea was 
conceived of staging the match on the 107th 
floor of the south tower of the World Trade 
Centre, which precisely in September was to 
be opened anew - after the infamous terror­
ist act of 1993. And we decided that it would 
be better to hold the match there, where 
they were eager for this event, rather than 
somewhere where they were ‘basically’ 
opposed to it.
The World Trade Centre took on the prepa­
ration of the playing hall (with seating for 
roughly two hundred) and the advertising of 
the match. It was a fortunate coincidence of 
interests: the Centre needed to again have 
the attention of the world community fo­
cused on it. Operating at the match were 
such mighty TV and radio companies as the 
CNN and the BBC. Chess players could not 
even dream of such publicity!
In July and August, like two years earlier, I 
again prepared intensively for the match on 
the Adriatic Sea, in blessed Croatia. It was a 
long time since I had felt so well, in the 
physical, as well as the chess and the psycho­
logical sense. I swam a great deal and went 
canoeing. I established my own personal 
record: I swam three and a half kilometres in 
the open sea in one hour, forty minutes. 
Almost every day I paddled up to seven 
kilometres in the canoe and at the chess 
board I spent two hundred and fifty hours.
Apart from the old-timer Alexander 
Shakarov, I was helped by Yuri Dokhoian and 
Yevgeny Pigusov (official seconds). And in 
the last week Vladimir Kramnik arrived; we 
played some rapid chess and looked at a few 
ideas. The inclusion in the team of a top- 
class grandmaster helped me to acquire the 
necessary confidence. In New York we were 
joined by Mikhail Khodarkovsky, my man­
ager and press attache.
Taking into account the experience of my
100

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
match with Short, I decided to expand my 
range of openings, and after 1 e4, apart from 
the usual 1...C5 2 
d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 £sxd4 
£sf6 5 £>c3 a6, I prepared a secret weapon:
5...g6 - the Dragon Variation! Noticing that 
Anand did not play so confidently against it 
as in other set-ups, we found several new 
ideas, and the Dragon justified itself 100%. In 
addition, for one game a rare line of the 
Rauzer Variation was planned - 5..£>c6 6 
jLg5 e6 7 
i.e7 8 0-0-0 0-0 9 f4 h6, etc. (cf.
Game N0.25, note to Black’s 8th move), but in 
the match things did not come to this.
Of course, much attention was devoted to 
the Najdorf Variation. But here we missed the 
mark: we analysed 6 .&e3 or 6 f3, and 6 JLg5, 
and 6 f4 - everything apart from the quiet 6 
jLe2. The only thing that we did not look at 
before the match was the Scheveningen: 
after all, before this, in contrast to me, Anand 
had no experience with it at all! However, it 
was in the Scheveningen that the main 
match battles developed, and with 6 JLe2 
Anand constantly created problems for me.
The 25-year-old challenger’s team com­
prised Ubilava, Yusupov (the official seconds), 
Speelman and Wolff. He was also helped by 
Dvoretsky, and a number of invisible volun­
teers, who were hoping for my defeat. During 
his preparation Anand sharply improved his 
theoretical erudition and made a thorough 
study of the 6 jLe2 variation in the Schevenin­
gen, the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez, 
which he had played in his youth and in the 
candidates matches (Yusupov was an expert 
on it), a new, aggressive scheme of counter­
play in the Scotch (cf. Game N0.38, note to 
White’s 10th move), a variation of the Nimzo- 
Indian 
which 
had 
been 
revived 
by 
Romanishin, and which quelled my enthusi­
asm for 1 d4 (cf. Game N0.63 in Part II of Garry 
Kasparov on Garry Kasparov, note to Black’s 
5th move), etc.
My opponent arrived for the match fully 
armed. Vishy was indeed the most worthy 
contender to the crown and could well have 
won both qualifying cycles - not only of the 
PCA, but also FIDE. ‘The match will be difficult 
not because it is being played on the 107th 
floor, but because Anand is a very dynamic 
and rapidly improving player’, I declared at an 
interview before the start. 'But I think that my 
great experience should tell and, most impor­
tant, the form which I have managed to 
acquire during the 50 days of training.’
The schedule of the match, which was to 
be the best of 20 games (and not 24, as 
previously), was unusually rigorous, genu­
inely professional. We played four times a 
week - on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays 
and Fridays, without time-outs and ad­
journments, with a seven-hour time control: 
two hours for 40 moves, an hour for 20, and 
half an hour to the end of the game. As was 
the case two years earlier, immediately after 
a game the players gave press conferences.
The drawing of lots was personally carried 
out by Giuliani. And the next day, 11 Sep­
tember (just think: exactly six years before 
the 2001 tragedy...), he made the move 1 c4 
for Anand and declared New York to be the 
capital of world chess!
'After all the photographers had snapped 
the beaming Rudolf and Garry and the faintly 
smiling Vishy, Anand took back his c-pawn 
and made his genuine first move - 1 e4l. The 
world champion promptly cast off his film 
actor’s mask and, after assessing the opponent 
with his unique and characteristic glance, 
replied 1...C5!’, writes the chess historian Isaak 
Linder, who recalls the amazing atmosphere 
of the match at the top of the sky-scraper:
'During the one minute of ascent on the 
rapid escalator your ears popped. Here pom  
the viewing platform there was a wonderful 
panorama of New York - pom  the Statue of
101

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
Liberty to the Brooklyn Bridge... That which I 
saw staggered me. In a cubic glass ‘aquarium’ 
three people were sitting: the two world- 
famous grandmasters at the chess table, and 
at the back of the stage a small, frail woman, 
the chief arbiter Carol Jarecki. Directly in front 
of the cube was the auditorium with places for 
those closest to the 'camps of the warring 
sides’. Some seats were marked ‘Kasparov’ and 
others ‘Anand’. Fans could also sit here if they 
paid 75 dollars for a ticket. For the others, less 
fastidious, crowded into the foyer and listen­
ing to the commentary on ear-pieces (they sat 
on the floor, reinforced by beer and sand­
wiches), the tickets were 15 dollars. “Fischer's 
dream has come true: chess in the public 
view", I sadly reflected...’
The first eight games ended in draws - a 
record for world championship matches! 
And although the battle was very tenacious, 
only once did we make more than 30 moves. 
This occurred in the third game, which 
Anand nearly won.

While Vishy was thinking (this lasted 29 
minutes), I went off to the rest room and 
there I suddenly realised that he was calculat­
ing the combination involving the e4-e5 
break and the typical bishop sacrifice on h7. 
Regretting that on the 17th move I had 
rushed with ...£id7-c5, I began feverishly 
wondering how to get out of this mess. And I 
took a decision while still 'behind the scenes’.

With a draw on the 37th move.
Whereas in the first five odd-numbered 
games the arena of battle was the Schev- 
eningen, in the even-numbered games I 
varied my openings, probing for weak points 
in my opponent’s preparation and obtaining
new material for analysis. I tried 1 d4,1 £rf3, 
1 e4 e5 2 £rf3 £ic6 3 -&b5 and 3 d4. And after 
the eighth game at night in my sleep (!), I 
finally discovered a ‘hole’ in the Open Varia­
tion of the Ruy Lopez, which had brought 
Anand a draw in the seventh game. During 
the free days my trainers and I thoroughly 
checked the correctness of the pretty combi­
nation that had been found, with the sacri­
fice of a pawn and a rook. It was time to go 
on the attack! But ahead lay Monday and the 
“black’ ninth game...
Just before the start of the match the ex­
perienced grandmaster Leonid Shamkovich 
predicted that ‘Anand would take the lead, 
but then Kasparov would draw level and 
move ahead’. After the eight draws he re­
fined his prognosis: ‘Kasparov needs to shake 
himself up, and to play his kind of risky chess. 
Perhaps for this he needs to lose one game? 
This would be a good stimulus for him, he 
would then be given a powerful surge of 
adrenalin in his blood. He needs a stimulant, 
to wake up from the sleep in which he finds 
himself at the start of the match.’
Amazingly, that is what happened. Ex­
cited by my fantastic ‘Spanish’ discovery, I 
was so gripped by anticipation of the tenth 
game the following day, that I was unable to 
concentrate on the ninth and I suffered a 
defeat. For the first time a theoretical nov­
elty let me down even before I could employ 
it! Now it was doubly important that it 
should work the following day.

In the opinion of Kramnik and other ex­
perts, it was a serious mistake by Anand to 
repeat the Open Variation. But apparently 
he was confident about the safety of his

And here is the novelty - an old recom­

lA-WxcS. Zaitsev: ‘I remember that with Tal 
and Balashov in Baguio the three of us 
analysed this bishop move and did not find 
anything positive in it. But in commentaries 
it was decided, exclusively with the aim of 
creating confusion, to also point out 14 -&c2, 
since this seemed to us to be a blind alley.

And only now, 17 years later, I realised how 
cruelly mistaken we were.’
14...WXC3 (l^-.lfdS? 15 a4!) 15 £sb3!!
The point of White’s idea! Whereas Anand 
spent only four minutes on the capture of 
the c3-pawn, after the stunning knight 
move (a sudden sacrifice of the rook on al!) 
he thought for all of 45 minutes - possibly a 
record for the ‘Indian miracle-worker’, who 
was famed for his quick reactions.
15...£sxb3?
Not an easy choice. 15~.£sb4? or 15...^.e7? 
is also bad because of 161ih5+, as is I5...g6?

In Informator I gave what was supposedly 
the only acceptable defence: l5...Sd8 16

tage for White’. However, after I7...£sxe5

does not have sufficient compensation for 
the exchange: I8...£sed7?l 19 £sd4! .&d6 20

‘Brilliant, but still not yet fully under­

saw this quiet move, I had doubts - after all, 
White gives up a whole rook. And we 
checked the variations on a computer which,

the correctness of White’s idea. This mo­

Yes, it was a long time since I had been in 
a situation where over two weeks of an 
event I had not once won, and so I did not 
want to spoil everything after such a bril­
liant novelty. Anand, by contrast, began 
playing quickly. I think that at heart he had 
already lost faith in a favourable outcome.

A grandiose and, most importantly, accu­

judged to be both the best and the theoreti­
cally most important in the 64th volume of 
Informator. It had a fatal psychological effect 
on my opponent: right to the finish Vishy 
was unable to regain his equanimity after 
this shock.
The scores were only level and half of the 
match still lay ahead, but Anand ‘floun­
dered’ in the very next game, when the hour
of the Dragon sounded. I played it for the 
first time in my life! On again encountering 
an opening surprise, Vishy chose a quiet 
continuation which led to a drawn end­
game, but I attacked too sharply on the 
queenside and gradually created problems 
for myself.

For the first time in the match I took the 
lead: 6-5. The following day in the 12th 
game Anand employed not the Open Varia­

Ruy Lopez. He was clearly in a ‘groggy’ state 
and reached a difficult endgame, but in 
time-trouble I missed excellent winning 
chances.
In the 13th game my team decided that I 
should repeat the formidable ‘Dragon’, 
despite the fact that my opponent had had a 
couple of days for preparation.

It is noteworthy that Anand again takes a

them - suppose that I had decided to use 
this defence on just the one occasion?

Panic. 21 Sdl! was essential, with the in­
tention of #d4. Anand grasped that this was 
the correct defensive idea, but he performed 
it badly: emotionally he was not ready for a 
grand battle, and as soon as the situation on 
the board changed sharply, he promptly 
went to pieces.
Against the rook move, in Informator I 
recommended 21...c3(?l) 22 #d4 fxe6, but 
after 23 0-0 White is quite alright. Other 
continuations are more dangerous for him:

This spectacular miniature caused Anand 
another mental trauma. A second successive 
loss with White! He tried to fight on, but the 
burden of accumulated misfortunes also 
told the following day - at the decisive 
moment of the 14th game.

to shock me with the exotic Scandinavian

Ag7, when Black had achieved a comfortable 
game, and after a series of excessively sharp 
moves by me, aimed at refuting this ‘incor­
rect opening’, he seized the initiative.
Mikhail Gurevich: ‘After coming under 
positional pressure, Carry employed a strong 
psychological ploy - he offered a draw after 
16 thxd5. Vishy hesitated and spent several 
minutes before he replied with I6...exd5 and 
a natural refusal. On this he spent some 
additional energy, whereas Kasparov gained 
confidence. He fought like the devil, and the 
scales of fortune began to rock together with 
the challenger...’

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
After gaining complete control of the e4 
point, Anand was already anticipating a 
swift reprisal - ....&e4, ...£sf5, etc. But here 
White unexpectedly launched into a close- 
range fight.
26 a6! b6?l (26...£sb5 would still have re­
tained an advantage) 27 £se5!
An unpleasant blow. ‘Threatened with a 
positional squeeze, Kasparov sharpens the 
situation, abruptly disturbing the material 
balance. Such a procedure, setting the 
opponent a difficult psychological problem, 
was one of which Tal had a brilliant com­
mand’ (Zaitsev).
27.. .We6
This reply was condemned by many 
commentators, but not by me. After 27...fxe5 
28 fxe5 £se4 29 £xd8 2xd8 30 g4l hxg4 31 
JLxg4 White would have gained a rook and a 
protected passed pawn for two minor 
pieces, and would easily have maintained 
the balance with play against the exposed 
king:
1) 3l...lTi7 32 &xf5 gxf5 (if 32...£sg3+?! 33 
&gl £sxf5, then not Gurevich’s move 34 
Sc3? because of 34..~&b4!, but 34 'Bfg4l with 
a dangerous attack) 33 Wf3 &h8 34 2c2 jLb4

2) 3l...^.xg4 32 l rxg4 £sf2+ 33 2xf2 Wxf2

3) 3l...£h6 32 ^.xf5 gxf5 33 2c2 &h7 (ac­
cording to Zaitsev, ‘with the better prospects 
for Black’) 34 ®g4 2f8 35 1i rh3 with the idea 
of 2c6 or 34 Wf3 f435 2fcl, etc.
Vishy assumed that the white knight 
would not run away from him - 28 £sc6?l 
2d7, but misfortune strikes from the other 
side.
28 g4!
Initiating wild complications. ‘Wonderful! 
This sudden thrust imparts a total character
to the play - individual strong or weak 
squares cease to play a significant role. The 
change of scene proved so sharp that Anand, 
who also had an advantage on the clock (he 
had 21 minutes left, against 10 for Kas­
parov), simply became rattled and in literally 
two moves he ended up in time-trouble. And 
the unimaginable din that arose in the hall 
penetrated through the sound-proof glass 
into the playing ‘bunker’ and conclusively 
overcame the challenger’ (MakaTychev).
28...hxg4 29 £lxg4
White has created ‘his’ play.

Suitable for maintaining the dynamic 
balance, although there were also more 
ambitious continuations:

'Hfxe3 32 jLxf6 2d7 33 2 el 2h7+ 34 £h4) 31

while if 30...2a8 there is 312xg7+!? ^xgy 32

31 £ie3 .&h3?
A time-trouble error in a position where it 
was not easy to find the correct solution. 
Thus 3l~.£>g3+? was bad because of 32 
^.xg3! 1Srxe3 33 2el, and 31...1rd6(?) 32 2xa7 
±c8, which I mistakenly recommended due 
to an oversight, in view of 33 f5l g5 34 We2 
with the idea of 34...gxh4 35 ^.xe4l, etc.
The dangerous rook on c7 should have 
been urgently exchanged. But after 3l...2d7?l
32 2xd7 1 ^ 7  33 £>xf5 gxf5 (33-MxfS^ 34
JLg4) 34 2 g l White retains some initiative: 
‘the excellently placed knight does not fully 
compensate for all the defects of the position’ 
(Zaitsev). Therefore the only correct defence is
31...2c8! 32 2xc8 (32 2xa7? £>c3) 32...2xc8 33 
£>xf5 gxf5, when the powerful knight to­
gether with control of the c-file secures Black 
equal chances.
32 2 g l
It is hard to refrain from such a move. But 
an unexpected idea, not mentioned by 
anyone, was also very strong: 32 jLg4l? 
(exchanging Black’s active pieces) 32..JLxg4 
331Srxg41Brxg4 34 £ixg4 - in the ending with 
his rook on the seventh rank and pawn on a6 
White has a big, if not decisive advantage:
34.. .2c8 35 2fcl or 34...2a8 35 2gl, etc.
32.. .g5?!
Desperation. If 32...f5?, then 33 ^.h5! is de­
cisive, while my recommendation 32...'ird6(?!)
33 2xa7 l fxf4 34 2xg6 2d7 35 2xd7 ±xd7 is 
unsuitable on account of 36 .&g4! (better

in time-tTouble one does not easily sacrifice a

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
In Inform ator this flamboyant move was 
given an exclamation mark, although in fact 
33 fxg5l fxg5 34 Sxa7 would have won more 
surely, for example: 34...b5 35 Sb7l &h8 36 
^.el and a6-a7 (36...1i rxa6? is not possible on 
account of 37 Jtxe4 Sxe4 38 Sxg7l <4>xg7 39 
Sxg5+).
33...i-xg4 34 #xg4 #xg4
35 Sxg4!
But here I guessed right: the ‘deserving of 
consideration’ 35 ®xg4(?l) was less good, 
since after 35...Sc8 36 Sxa7 Sa8 37 2d7 
Sxa6 38 £>e3 (Wahls) 38...Sea8! 39 £)xd5 
S a l or 35...Sf81? 36 fxg5 fxg5 37 £ie5 & xe5
38 dxe5 Sf7 39 i.xg5 £ixg5 40 Sxg5+ &f8 
Black would have had chances of escaping to 
a draw a pawn down.
35.. .®d6
At the press conference after the game I 
gave preference to 35...Sc8. If 36 Sxa7 Black 
loses after 36...Scl+ (to say nothing of
36.. .‘&f8? 37 £if5) 37 4^2 S b l 38 Sb7l Sb2+

Sxa8 38 fxg5 fxg5 39 ®xd5 Sxa6 40 Sxe4 
gxh4 41 Sxh4 Sa5 42 £>xb6 Sb5 and ...Sxb3 
he would retain hopes of saving the game, 
although two pawns down.
36 ^.f2 £>b5 (it is clear that the knight did
not willingly go from e4 to b5) 37 Sb7 Se4 
(but here 37...^d61? 38 Sxa7 Sa8 was more 
resilient) 38 f5
I liked this move, bmying the g7-bishop 
for ever, but there was a technically simpler 
win by 38 h4 (it is also possible to begin with
38 £)f5 or 38 4g2) 38...2xf4 39 Sxf4 gxf4 40 
£>f5 i-f8 414g2.
38...2xg4
There is nothing else: the black knight has 
to guard the a7-pawn, the bishop cannot 
come into play - 38..JLf8? 39 £}xd5l, and 
neither can the rook on d8 - 38...2c8? 39 
®xd5l 2cl+ (39-2xg4? 40 £ie7+) 40 2 g l 
2 c2 41 ^.e3l (instead of the Inform ator 41

39 £)xg4 2c8
In the time scramble the disorderly rum­
ble of the spectators’ voices continued to 
carry through to us, for the first time in the 
match penetrating through the supposed 
sound-proof barrier. Both players nervously 
flinched and in perplexity looked first 
around, and then at the arbiter...
40 2d7?!
A vexing mistake on the last move before 
the time control. It was more logical by 40 
h4l to continue the attack on the kingside,
114

where White is dominant: 40...gxh4 41 .&xh4 
Uc6 42 4g2 followed by 4g3-f4 and the 
threat of Sd7 or Hb8+.
40...2c2?
With his flag about to fall, Anand missed 
a chance opportunity - 40...Sc3l. After this 
in Informator I gave a pretty ‘win’: 41 Sxd5 
fixb3 42 2d8+ 4>f7 43 Sd7+ 4>f8 44 4g2 Sa3 
45 h4! gxh4 46 .&xh4 Bxa6 47 .&xf6 (47

and wins) 50 f61? 4xd7 51 f7 fia2+ 52 4g3 
2a3+ 53 4g4, overlooking a pretty draw -

But the correct move is 41 £se3l Sxb3, and 
now not 42 £sxd5(?) Sa3 and ...Bxa6 with a 
draw (Wahls), but 42 4g2!, making it diffi­
cult for Black to win the a6-pawn and inexo­
rably increasing the pressure:
1) 42...Sb4 43 £)xd5 Sa4 44 4>f3 2xa6 45 
4g4 (with the threat of 4h5-g6) 45-Sa3 46

2) 42...‘4>f8 43 £>xd5 Sa3 44 £)b4 Sa4 
(44...4g8 45 Sd5) 45 ± e l S a l 46 4f2, 
repelling all the attacks and intending a 
decisive assault;
3) 42...Sa3 43 Sxd5l £>c7 (43...Sb3 44 4 f 3) 
44 Sd8+ 4h7 45 Sd7 £)b5 46 £)g4 4g8 47 
Sd5 Sa5 48 h4! gxh4 49 ^.ell, winning 
material and the game.
41 Sxd5 1-0
In view of 41...£sc7 42 Sd8+ and Sc8.
At the end of the game this was how I ex­
plained my opponent’s failure: ‘He was very 
well prepared personally against me. His 
trainers took into account all my habits, 
passions and characteristics, the openings 
that I play, and so on, but they did not take 
account of the individual characteristics of 
Anand himself. They imposed on Vishy a 
manner of play which was uncharacteristic 
of him, they squeezed him into a framework
where a pn'ori he was unable to demon­
strate what he was capable of through his 
talent. Anand as though forgot about his 
rich intuition, he completely excluded n'sk, 
he aimed to calculate everything to the end, 
and those variations in which this was not 
possible he simply rejected. This was not in 
accordance with his style, talent and vision 
of the game.’
This fourth win in five games increased 
my lead to 8y2-5y2. To retain my title I only 
needed to score another one and a half 
points.
The match was effectively decided, and I 
again fell into a slight doze. The outcome of 
this was four draws, of which only the 17th 
game was protracted. Vishy finally joined 
battle in a Dragon (cf. Came No.2l, note to 
White’s 12th move), and obtained a better 
endgame, but after mistakes by both sides 
towards the end of the fourth hour of play I 
managed to save the game.
The following day in the 18th game the 
exhausted fighters did not see any point in 
prolonging the torture: I offered a draw on 
the 15th move, and we shook hands 13 
minutes and 35 seconds after the start of 
play. ‘Congratulations’, Anand said quietly. 
The match concluded ahead of schedule: 
lO'/i-l'/*.
This was a really difficult duel, and for me 
especially from the third to the tenth game. 
For the first time I sensed an ambiguous 
attitude towards myself: whereas most 
chess fans were rooting for me, most profes­
sionals were openly wanting me to lose, so 
that the chess world should finally acquire a 
‘correct’ champion and rid itself of the ‘PCA 
diktat’.
And I myself was exhausted by the con­
stant organizational problems, but after my 
win in the match I was filled with optimism 
and I stated in an interview that soon the
115

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
PCA would have a new two-year contract 
with the Intel Corporation (‘a good contract, 
the details of which are now being worked 
out’), and that in it they had already pledged 
one and a half million dollars for the unifica­
tion match, envisaged in the Moscow 
agreement with FIDE. Alas, in December, 
because of the torpedoing of this agreement 
and the constant attacks on the PCA in the 
press, Intel changed its mind about signing 
the contract and pulled out of chess.
To a question about the presence in my 
team of the potential contender foT the title 
VladimiT KTamnik (suppose you have to play 
a match against him?), I carelessly replied: ‘I 
don’t see any problem here. Volodya and I 
are on excellent terms. If we need to play a 
match, we will prepare, and devise some­
thing. He has learned a lot about me, and I 
have learned something about him’. These 
words were remembered five years later, in 
October 2000...
Despite my fatigue, ten days afteT the tam­
ing of the ‘Madras tigeT’ I had to compete in 
the third, concluding tournament of the PCA 
Grand Prix Super-classic (HoTgen, 20 October 
- 1 November 1995): 1-2. KTamnik and Ivan­
chuk - 7 out of 10; 3-4. Ehlvest and Short - 6; 
5. Kasparov - 5; 6-8. Yusupov, Korohnoi and 
Gulko - 4 Vi; 9. LautieT - 4; 10. Vaganian - 372; 
11. Timman - 3.
Another ten days lateT, 9-12 November, 
while continuing to complain of a Tjad head’ 
and being 'sick of chess’ afteT New YoTk, I won 
the decisive, Paris stage of the Intel Rapidplay 
Grand Prix, smashing Morozevich, Kiril GeoT- 
giev and Anand all 2-0, and defeating Kram­
nik in the final (l-l; 1V2-V2). And, finally, on 30 
November and l  December, I played two 
games in Lublin for the Sarajevo Bosna team 
in the European Club Cup (+1=1).
But on 25 November 1995, at a scandalous 
FIDE Congress in Paris, suddenly, in violation
of all the rules, traditions and juridical norms 
of FIDE activity, for the first time a completely 
new person was elected to the post of its 
President - a Russian citizen, the 33-yeaT-old 
millionaire and President of Kalmykia, Kirsan 
llyumzhinov. In his enthronement speech he 
said that he considered himself a friend of 
both Karpov and Kasparov - and that he 
could ‘bring them to peace’.
But at first it was unclear whether it 
would in fact be possible to overcome the 
stubborn resistance of those opposed to the 
immediate signing of the agreement with 
the PCA. Thus Makarov, President of the 
Russian Chess Federation, who played a 
prominent role in the unification process, 
stated immediately afteT the Congress: ‘The 
new FIDE President faces the very difficult 
task of unifying the world championship... 
The agreement between FIDE and the PCA, 
with excellent financial conditions for FIDE, 
where it is allotted funds for chess develop­
ment ($300,000 a yeaT - G.K.), has been 
prepared and signed by the PCA. Today it is 
up to FIDE to make the next move.'
Soon, on 21 December, the Russian Chess 
Federation Praesidium also expressed anxi­
ety: 'The Congress in Paris, which wrecked the 
agreement between FIDE and the PCA, effec­
tively violated grossly a decision of the Moscow 
Congress, which was unanimously approved in 
December 1994. In this way the split in chess 
has not only not been overcome, but has 
possibly been aggravated still further.’
However, already on 23 December a sensa­
tional Teport arrived from Singapore: the FIDE 
Presidential Board had approved a suggestion 
by llyumzhinov to contest the world champi­
onship in annual knock-out tournaments 
with the participation of 128 leading players 
and with an overall prize fund of $5 million, 
and that Kasparov and the winner of the 
forthcoming Karpov-Kamsky match would be
116

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
admitted directly into the semi-finals of the 
first such tournament.
But what about the planned unification 
match? My reply was expressed in a long 
interview, entitled ‘I am the world cham­
pion. Not of a particular version, but of 
chess!’ (a more complete text of it is given in 
Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988-2009):
‘Was the new FIDE project agreed with me 
beforehand? No, I was simply handed the 
facts... FIDE faced a dilemma - peace, or war 
with the PCA. I think that the ‘Singapore’ 
knock-out project may have been conceived 
before llyumzhinov and initiated by Karpov 
and his ally, the new FIDE first vice-president 
Kouatly, also a fervent opponent of the 
agreement with the PCA (Karpov: "These 
ideas, apart from the financial part, belong to 
Kouatly. I come to this conclusion, because 
earlier he discussed them with me." - G.K.). To 
llyumzhinpv this project certainly seems 
logical as a way of reassuring the chess 
world - but I will tTy to disclose its true sense 
and the latent threat.
‘Karpov understands perfectly well that in 
a match between the two world champions 
he will lose hopelessly, and in his heart he 
also recognises the fictitious nature of his 
‘appointed’ title. Something must be devised, 
some chance found! But money is needed, 
and quite a lot. But there is no money. And 
then, like a magician, Kirsan llyumzhinov 
appears. And somewhere behind the scenes a 
plan is conceived, which they will now try to 
put into effect: if it is not possible to fight for 
the title, it has to be eliminated! Or more 
precisely, devalued, reduced to a lottery, to a 
chance happening, to a transitory title, played 
for in some annual tournament, which will 
completely kill the old-age tradition. Typical 
profanation!
‘The implication of this entire operation is 
simple: if I agree to play in the tournament,
Karpov will have better chances than in a 
usual match, while if I refuse, they will effec­
tively isolate me and compel me to play a 
match dictated by their conditions... However, 
I am sure that they are seriously mistaken. I 
will not play in the new FIDE world champi­
onship, irrespective of the prize fund.’

In January 1996 I gave a clock simul’ in Rio 
de Janeiro against the Brazilian team (5-1), 
and in February I played a match in Phila­
delphia with an IBM brainchild - the com­
puter Deep Blue (4-2). But in the absence of 
Linares (the only year when it did not take 
place; I missed 1995 because of the scandal 
in 1994), my first tournament appearance 
came in March at the Euwe Memorial in 
Amsterdam.
This category 18 super-toumament dif­
fered from Linares in that the number of 
participants was smaller, but they were no 
less strong: all the leading grandmasters 
arrived, with the exception of Ivanchuk, as 
well as Karpov and Kamsky - they faced a 
match for the title of FIDE champion (pre­
cisely at the time when, on not finding any 
decent sponsors, llyumzhinov came to an 
agreement with his ‘friend’ Saddam Hussein 
and announced that the venue would be 
Baghdad!).
‘For the first time after an interval of nearly 
six months Kasparov participated in a strong 
tournament’, wrote my second Yuri Dok- 
hoian. ‘After all, isolated games in simuls’ or 
team events cannot be compared with full-

scale and serious encounters with such dan­

apart. Playing against it has its own specific 
nature and is rather unpleasant. The slightest 
inaccuracy, to say nothing of a mistake, 
practically deprives you of any subsequent 
chances. The machine’s iron logic is not subject 
to the psychological nuances of the struggle, 
and it is not possible to upset its equilibrium or 
confuse it in complications. The match with 
Deep Blue took a great deal of emotional and 
physical strength, but it did not have any 
definite significance in Kasparov’s prepara­
tions for a normal "human’ tournament. This 
isolation from competitions with humans told 
at the very start, but with each subsequent 
round his taste for the game gradually re­
turned.’
My start in Amsterdam was discouraging: I 
suffered an opening disaster in the Najdorf 
with 6 iLc4, playing Black against Topalov (it 
is amusing that in the third round Short took 
‘revenge’ on him, by improving my variation 
cf. Came No.3, note to White’s 9th move). 
Then I won an interesting King’s Indian with 
Black against Piket, gaining revenge for my 
loss the previous year in a Griinfeld, but 
Topalov created a new sensation: he also 
defeated the second participant in the recent 
world championship match - Anand!
Against the background of these events, 
my next game with Vishy Anand acquired 
particular importance.

Tired of the ‘Spanish torture’, Anand, like 
Karpov in his time, tries the super-solid 
Caro-Kann as a panacea against all ills.

I also decided to surprise my opponent, 
and instead of my usual 3 ®d2 (Came Nos.8, 
48), I chose the Panov Attack, which I had 
never previously played, although I had 
analysed it a little, first with Makarychev, 
and then with Dokhoian. Later I also took a 
look at 3 e5 (Game No.77).

Now this relieving manoeuvre does not 
achieve its aim; with his e7-bishop still on 
the board, Black has a cramped position. 
White begins hindering his queenside 
development, doing everything possible to 
prevent ...b7-b6 and ...e6-e5.

With the obvious intention of freeing 
himself with I 3...b6. Here I thought for a 
long time, trying to understand how White 
could retain the initiative...
13 Sell!
A deep prophylactic move in the style of 
Nimzowitsch! This at first sight strange 
move (the rook runs up against its own 
pawn) was one that I was very proud of. It 
was my opponent’s tum to think: he faced a 
serious psychological dilemma - whether or 
not to play ...b7-b6. In the end the most 
critical move seemed too dangerous to 
Anand, and he preferred to make a waiting 
move with his rook.

told: White is better after both 15-dxc4? 16

(the rook has done its job on cl), although in

this plan to be more unpleasant for Black,

This paradoxical pawn sacrifice sets Black 
a difficult practical problem: how to parry 
the threatened direct attack on the kingside? 
‘This sacrifice is of the ‘purely Kasparov’ 
category: there can be no doubt about its 
correctness’ (Makarychev).
20.. .11d7
A natural developing move, although also 
slightly passive. Black would like to exchange 
knights and bishops - 20...£>xe5?! 21 dxe5

23 Whs! and wins), the insidious tactical

A critical point of the game.
22.. .5b8?
The correct idea - to get rid of the white 
rook on the seventh rank and seize control of 
the b-file - but incorrectly implemented. 
From the press: ‘It was said that the match in 
New York had left its mark and that Vishy 
had not yet rid himself of the negative 
emotions.’ At any event, in this game Anand 
was unable to cope with the constantly 
arising problems.
But how should 
Black 
play? After

saved by 23„JLxb7 24 ^.xh6 g6 25 ^.xg6!,

maintained in the fourth round, in which we 
all drew - I escaped with difficulty in an­
other Sicilian duel with Short (cf. Game No.5, 
note to White's 10th move).
In the fifth round the quintet split up, 
since only Topalov and I won. The game with 
Yasser Seirawan, played 'in Tal style’, also 
afforded me enormous pleasure.

paradoxical way of sharpening the play...

11.. .£>xf2
Seirawan played this without thinking, 
evidently assuming that I had missed this

words, to wild complications.

Here Yasser thought for a long time and 
he realised that Black faced quite difficult 
problems.
’Initially Seirawan was probably looking 
for an accurate way of converting his extra 
material, then he unwillingly reconciled 
himself to the forthcoming great technical 
difficulties, and later fatigue from the 
fruitless searches began to set in, and a fatal 
idea occurred to him... Any playeT will be

familiar with such a psychological situation. 
Moreover, deliberately creating it for the 
opponent may even be a distinctive creative 
procedure.’ (Makarychev).
14.. .f6
The decision to give up the g7-pawn and 
at the same time weaken the king’s defences 
looks very risky (and, indeed, the far from 
obvious 14...Wb4l? 15 #xg7 #f8 with the 
idea of 16 #d4 #05! or 16 Wg3 Sg8 17 'S,f2 
b6 and ...Jtb7 would have been more solid), 
but my opponent was hoping that the rapid 
return of the queen would consolidate his 
position.
If Black had begun clinging on to the ma­
terial, he would have been left with a ‘bad’ 
king and his development incomplete.

16 Sdl # c 5+ (I6...±b7? 17 Sxd7l) 17 i h l

In Makarychev’s opinion, since in these 
variations the king is stuck in the centre and 
the terrible weakness of the dark squares is
felt, Black should have acted pragmatically - 
‘calmly castle, give back the exchange and 
play for a draw’: 14...0-0 15 Ah6 g6 16 Sdl! 
(not rushing with iLxf8, since the rook will 
not run away: l 6...Sd8? 17 ih l!  or l 6...Se8?

17.. ..1,c5+ 18 'i’h l Wh5l, etc. However, White 
could try his luck with 17 Axf8 <£ixf8

with the idea of Sd4 and ^ e 4, retaining the

driving the white queen from its attacking 
position. True, after 18 Wf4 (18 Wh4?! #g6)

Yasser obviously underestimated the

24.. .b5 (24...1d7 25 £if4 I rg8(f7) 26 Wd6! or

The most obvious move. However, first 27

ing.
27.. .1.b7
If 27-.Sc7 White would have won not only 
by 28 Sxc7 Wxc7 29 b6 2b8 30 ^ h 5, but also 
by the sequence 28 Sdl! J.b7 29 bxa6 or

There was another dual solution - 28 b6!? 
±xf3 29 gxf3 Sb7 30 Sdl! or 28...Sc8 29 
2xc8+ i.xc8 30 <£)d2l, and the black army is

28.. .£xf3
If 28...Axa6, then 29 S al or 29 ^d4 is 
good, while after 28...Sxa6 - 29 Wb5! 2a8 30

A f2  1-0
The leaders were now Kasparov and Topa­
lov - 3V2 out of 5, Kramnik - 3. In the sixth 
round I drew with difficulty in a King’s 
Indian battle with Timman, while Kramnik 
defeated Topalov and replaced him in the 
leading duo - we each had 4 out of 6.
In the seventh round I had White against 
the No.2 in the world rating list, Vladimir 
Kramnik, and, of course, I was in a fighting 
mood, taking into account not only the 
competitive importance of the game, but 
also the current score of our individual 
meetings in ‘classical’ play (+1-1=5).

A move order which excludes the
Sveshnikov Variation. But Kramnik readily
agrees to the Rauzer Variation, various lines 
of which he played regularly at that time. 
One of them we even prepared together for 
my match with Anand (cf. the note to Black’s
8th move, below).

games (Moscow (rapid) 1996; Novgorod 
1997; 1st and 3rd match games (rapid), 
Frankfurt 1999), bringing me three draws 
and one win - and that was not as a result of 
the opening (cf. Game No.l2l).

‘Earlier 10...0-0 occurred, but Black did not 
achieve equality. Kramnik tries to develop 
his queenside’ (Dokhoian). On the next two 
moves I spent 55 minutes!
11 JLxf6
There are also other plans (say, 11 &e2 
JLb7 12 JLf3), but this looks the most logical: 
while there is an opportunity, it is useful to 
spoil Black’s pawn structure. I had studied 
this type of position for both sides.

As it transpired, this novelty - a simple 
developing move - is, alas, insufficiently 
energetic. Tbe typical 12 f5 is parried by the 
equally typical 12...#c7 and ..McS (Dolma- 
tov-Aseev, Kemer 1995). I also thought about 
tbe ‘unclear’ 12 e5l, but at tbe board I didn’t 
see what White should do after 12...d5

Then 12 jLe2 appeared on tbe scene, after 
which Black played both 12...1i ,a5?! 13 e5!

It is possible to force tbe exchange of

better.

‘A typical Kasparov manoeuvre: tbe queen 
moves away from tbe centre, to avoid being 
exchanged, and beads closer to tbe enemy 
king.’ (M.Gurevich).
13.. .#c5 14 % 3
Tbe threat of Wg7 is rather ephemeral: 
even if Black should lose bis h7-pawn, be has 
chances of creating queenside counterplay. 
This is what Kramnik is aiming for.

Kramnik sensed that a convenient mo­
ment to become active had arrived, but he 
struck from the wrong side! I8...f5l and 
...lf6 was very strong - the power of this

ensured Black the better prospects: 19 c4

A sudden lack of vigilance - the defence of 
the f6-pawn is weakened! 3i...^.b7 sug­
gested itself, for example: 32 2d7 (32 #g3+ 
^
6!) 32...^.xe4 33 #xe4 2hd8! with equal­
ity (34 #xa4 2a8 35 #e4 2xd7 36 #xa8 
2dl+ 37 &a2 # g l, etc.) or 32 i.xb7 2xb7! 33 
#g3+ &h6, and Black is out of danger (34 
# h 4 2d8!).
32 2dd2?i
Blindness in reply, which was all the more 
strange, in that I had already seen a similar 
idea for sharply improving my position (cf. 
the note to Black’s 27th move) - 32 b4! 2d8 
(32...axb3? 33 2c6 and wins) 33 2xd8 #xd8 
34 #e3+ *g7 35 2d2 # c7 36 £ c2!, aiming 
at the weak pawns on a4 and h5, or 32.. Ji.b7
33 i.xb7 #xb7 34 #e3+ &g7 35 #g3+ &f8
36 #h4 # b 6 37 2cd2 2c8 38 2d5 with 
unpleasant pressure (38...#e3 39 25d3 # b 6 
40 ^ all, threatening b4-b5).
In Informator preference was given to a 
tempting ‘blow from the right’ - 32 g4, but 
after 32...2g8! and ...iLb7 Black would have 
held on.
32...i,b7?
A thematic move - made at the most in­
appropriate moment. In the given specific 
situation, in order to defend against the 
threats along the sixth rank, Black should 
have urgently exchanged his passive rook on 
h8 for the active rook on d2 - 32...2d8 with 
equality.
33 .&xb7 #xb7 34 2c6!
Black has nevertheless come under pres­
sure and he is now forced to seek a way of 
compensating for the unavoidable loss of his 
f6-pawn.
34...2hc8!
The best practical chance. In the event of
34-2hd8 35 2xf6+ &g7 36 #xb7 2xb7 37 
2xf7+ 2xf7 38 2xd8 2xf5 39 &C2 or 34...'&g7 
35 #g3+ 4*8 36 2xf6 #e4+ 37 #d3l #xd3+ 
38 2xd3 Black would have reached a difficult 
rook endgame a pawn down.

This allows White an additional resource.

that 36 Sxf7 was more dangerous for Black.

It is useful to check where the king will

38...4>f4?!
‘The decisive mistake in severe time- 
trouble: now it becomes impossible to stop 
the f-pawn’ (Dokhoian). Indeed, the unex­
pected ‘leap to the side’ 38...'&h4! would 
have been far more resilient, for example: 39

2xe5! 1-0
‘A fantastic dash!’ (M.Gurevich).
Thanks to this important win, for the first 
time in the entire tournament I became the 
sole leader - 5 out of 7. But hot on my heels 
was Topalov, after beating Lautier.
In the eighth round I had Black against 
Lautier, an ‘awkward’ opponent for me. 
After ordering lunch in my room, Dokhoian 
and I were calmly concluding our prepara­
tions and preparing to take our traditional 
walk, when there was a sudden phone call 
from the organisers: ‘Where are you?’. I 
replied: ‘In my room.' And then I realised to 
my hoiror that we had forgotten to put our 
clocks forward by an hour! It was precisely 
on that Sunday 3lst March that Europe 
switched to summer time...
After sprinting to the venue I arrived half 
an hour late for the game and rapidly rattled 
out a King’s Indian Defence. Fortunately, the 
game followed a line I had analysed, I em­
ployed a novelty with a pawn sacrifice, and 
without particular anxiety I gained a draw.
In the meantime Topalov won a good 
King’s Indian with Black against Gelfand and 
caught up with me just before the finish. 
Kramnik would have tried to give chase, but 
against Anand he lost from an excellent 
position with White.
In the final round the burgeoning Topalov 
had White against Piket. I did not expect 
anything good to come of this game, and to 
avoid falling behind my rival I had to win ‘to 
order’ against Boris Gelfand. For this I again 
had to display exceptional resourcefulness.

At that time my interest in 6 .&C4 (Game

the set-up with 6 £.e2, where Dokhoian and I 
had some new, interesting ideas, one of

If 9...b5?l, then 10 a4l is unpleasant (Game

boldly switches to play along the lines of the 
Boleslavsky Variation - 5- £ ic6 6 Ji.e2 e5 7 
£)b3 Ae7 8 0-0 0-0 9 f4 a5, despite the fact 
that White’s king is already on h i and he has 
an extra tempo compared with the well- 
known variation 10 a4 £>b4 l l  'A’hl.
Earlier only 10...exf4 was played, which 
after l l  ±xf4 ie 6  12 # e l and Bdl leaves
White with a small plus, or 10...b5l - the 
strongest continuation, which later was also 
employed by Gelfand.
11 a4 £)b4
Perplexed by the unexpected tum of 
events, I sank into thought: what can be 
extracted from the extra tempo?
12 i.f3
White intends a new, double-edged plan 
with g2-g4, trying to make use of the king’s 
position on h i for an attack on the g-file.
The usual 12 jk,e3 favours White after
12.. JLd7?l 13 Af3 (Geller-Reshevsky, Palma 
de Mallorca Interzonal 1970; Geller-Poluga- 
evsky, Portoroz 1973) or I2...#c7?l 13 Sell

Kavalek-Spassky, Manila Interzonal 1976).
12..JLe6 13 f5 JLd7 with the idea o f.. Jtc6 
and ...d6-d5 is not so clear. And I did not like 
the immediate relieving manoeuvre in the 
centre - 12...d5l? 13 fxe5 £)xe4, when after 
14 £)xe4 (if 14 i.f3, then not the Informator

Ae6 it is hard for White to hope for any 
particular advantage.
It was for this reason that I played 12 jtf3 
- conceding the c4-square to Black seemed
135

to me to be the lesser evil.
12...#b6!?
The developing 12..Ji.e6 13 g4 Sc81? was 
also good, while if 13 .&e3, then also 13-Sc8 
or 13...®c7, obtaining a comfortable position 
from the first game of the Karpov-Spassky 
match (Game No.83 in Part III of My Great 
Predecessors). However, the queen move is 
more interesting: by depriving the white 
bishop of the e3-square, Black provokes the 
enemy fire!
IB g4l (13 ^ 2  #a61? 14 £ib5 .&e6 or 13 S el 
#f2!? 14 Se2 #h4 is unclear) 13...exf4
Black takes urgent measures against g4- 
g5. 13...d5? 14 exd5 or 13....&e6?! 14 g5 
4?se8(d7) 15 f5 was unsuitable. But 13...h61? 
deserved attention, since now ‘the inactive 
knight on b3 can embark on the dangerous 
route b3-d4-f5’ (Dokhoian).
14 .&xf4 £sd7 15 £sd4 g6?!
Gelfand is aiming to play as safely as pos­
sible and he underestimates the positional 
sacrifice of a piece. The immediate 15~.£se5l 
would have enabled him to hold on after 16 
£sf5 icxf5 17 exf5 £)xf3 18 #xf3 h6 (but not
18.. .£sxc2? 19 £sd5 y id 8  20 1^4 £sxal 21

After the audacious exchange sacrifice
I6...£ie5?! both the romantic 17 £>f5l? and 
the pragmatic 17 .&xf8 were possible.
17 £sf5!
After taking a deep breath, I sacrificed the 
knight. Since otherwise White cannot count 
on anything, the sacrifice is essentially forced. 
I did not see all the variations, of course, but I 
felt that my attack would be sufficient at 
least to maintain the balance and would set 
my opponent difficult problems.
17...gxf5
After 17-..^e5 18 4?sxe7+ White’s chances 
are rather better: his dark-squared bishop is 
now very strong. And if 17...^.f8?l he would 
have replied 18 ^ 2 1 , insisting on I8...gxf5 
19 gxfs.
18 gxf5 i-f6!
Dokhoian and I condemned this ‘King’s 
Indian’ move, since after it White regains the 
sacrificed material and has the initiative 'for 
free’. However, in the variation which we 
recommended - l8...‘A>h8 19 Sgl ,&f8 
(19-Sg8? is weak in view of 20 2xg8+ ‘A’xgS

Unhum'edly increasing the pressure - it is

Topalov also won, and we shared first 
place, one and a half points ahead of our 
nearest rivals. It was an uncommonly fight­
ing tournament: two-thirds of the games 
ended decisively.
Genna Sosonko: ‘This was a major success 
for the 21-year-old Bulgarian grandmaster, 
who is always impeccably dressed and ex­
tremely correct. His ability to sit and concen­
trate is amazing. Topalov is excellently pre­
pared, and he may improve still further, 
although he is already a grandmaster of very 
high class. Not without reason the Dutch 
press commented that in the tournament 
there were two brilliant winners... ’
‘I think that this was one of my best tour­
naments in recent years’, I stated soon 
afterwards. ‘I am very happy with my play, 
except, of course, the game with Topalov. 
But after it I scored ‘plus five’. I won all my 
games with White! There was the same kind 
of ‘roller’ as in my games of some ten years 
ago: all the white pieces advance, and 
against this hurricane Black cannot defend. 
Moreover, this had nothing to do with my 
widely advertised opening preparation: not 
once did I gain an overwhelming position 
from the opening, but all the wins were 
achieved in an exceptionally tense battle!
‘I often ended up in time-trouble, but I still 
continued to control the situation. I am 
happy that I have overcome something of a 
creative slump, which was observed both 
during the match with Anand, and in last 
year’s ‘classical’ events, when I noticed to my 
dismay that my play had become more sterile 
and the vivid colours had disappeared... Here I 
was fighting with young players, who have 
grown up with my games, demonstrating my 
approach to the struggle. So that I regard 
Amsterdam 1996 as a kind of progress report 
on my ten years as champion. For me it is very 
important that I myself have also not forgot­
ten how to play attacking, fighting chess.’
Difficult Opponent
International Tournament in Dos Hermanas

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
Topalov - 6 out of 9; 3-4. Anand and Kas­
parov - 5Vi; 5- Hlescas - 4'A; 6-7. Kamsky and 
Gelfand - 4; 8. Ivanchuk - 3V2; 9-10. Shirov 
andJ.Polgar- 3.
After Amsterdam I also took part in the 
April 'Kremlin Stars’ rapid-play knock-out 
tournament in the PCA Grand Prix series. Two 
years earlier I had lost in the quarter-final to 
Kramnik, and a year earlier to Anand in the 
semi-final, but on this occasion I reached the 
final, on the way defeating Gelfand (2-0) and 
Dreev (l-l; 1-0), and spectacularly crushing 
Anand (Game No.115). In the final Kramnik 
and I drew l-l, but then I played terribly in 
the blitz tie-break: I lost the first game with 
White, after avoiding a repetition of moves 
(although I had less time and an inferior 
position!), and in one move I threw away a 
win in the second. Apparently the Kremlin is 
not my territory...
It stands to reason that I again wanted to 
get even with Kramnik, and an opportunity 
presented itself at the end of May in the 
small Spanish town of Dos Hermanas. This 
categoiy 19 super-tournament assembled 
almost the entire chess elite, including even 
the FIDE challenger Kamsky, who within five 
days was due to start his long-suffering 
match with Karpov, which had after all been 
switched from Baghdad to Elista.
My first appearance in Dos Hermanas was 
also my last: the playing conditions were not 
veiy impressive. Compared with this hamlet, 
modest Linares looked like a world capital! 
The playing room was in a small, stuffy 
semi-basement, which resembled an air-raid 
shelter This, to put it mildly, did not pro­
mote creativity, and for me it was a difficult 
and not veiy successful tournament.
My starting duel with Gata Kamsky 
turned out to be tense and nervy. In a slow 
Ruy Lopez (cf. Game No.2, note to White’s 8th
move) by the 24th move I obtained an 
obvious positional advantage, but here I 
suddenly became stuck and I was unable to 
build on my success - draw. This game 
proved to be the last of our eight ‘classical’ 
tournament meetings (+4-1=3).
In the second round I had a short but veiy 
wild Sicilian draw with Anand (cf. Game 
No.37, note to White’s 6th move). Then in 
the third I won against Shirov, but in the 
fourth for the first time I was unable to beat 
lllescas with White - a warning signal! At 
this point the leading five looked like this: 
Anand - 3Vi out of 4, Gelfand - 3; Kasparov 
and Topalov - 2V2; Kramnik - 2.
In the fifth round those who were trailing 
gave chase: Topalov defeated Gelfand, and 
Kramnik, who had begun the tournament 
with four draws, ‘wore out’ Anand on the 
101st move. I gained a draw with Ivanchuk, 
after employing another novelty in the 
King’s Indian (cf. Game N0.36 in Kasparov vs. 
Karpov 1988-2009, note to White’s 8th 
move). The leading group became much 
more compact: Anand and Topalov - 3Vi out 
of 5; Kasparov, Kramnik and Gelfand - 3.
The next day I had White against my 
‘Kremlin conqueror’, Vladimir Kramnik. By 
his own admission, in this game he was 
ready to do everything to maintain his ‘plus 
one’, which had been gained with such 
difficulty. But I was eager to reach ‘plus two’.

This was my only loss after 1 d4 in almost 
19 years, from the ill-starTed 18th game of 
the 1986 match (Game No.18 in Part II of 
Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov) to the 
end of my career in 2005! And it was no 
accident that I suffered it against Kramnik - 
my most awkward opponent since the mid- 
1990s. The vexation and bitterness of this 
painful reverse took a long time to pass: 
after all, if I had won this game, I would 
probably also have won the tournament.
In the meantime Topalov snatched a win 
against Kamsky, who on the 45th move 
committed ‘hara-kiri’ in an equal position, 
and became the sole leader - 4Vi out of 6. 
Despite my soiry state, I managed to compose 
myself and make a reasonable finish. True, in
my game with Judit Polgar played after the 
free day I was a little lucky. After obtaining an 
easily won ending, I suddenly made a ‘bril­
liant’ move - 32...£>e4? and threw away the 
greater part of my advantage. But then I 
nevertheless contrived to win a textbook 
endgame with rook and knight against rook.

After this miraculous save Veselin re­

At the very finish I was fortunate to win 
with Black from a hopeless position against 
Gelfand, who with his 40th move, the last 
before the time control, changed the evalua­
tion of the position from ‘completely won’ to 
‘completely lost’. Thanks to this I caught 
Anand, who lost out in the "battle of the chal­
lengers’ to the aggressively inclined Kamsky, so 
that Vishy and I finished half a point behind 
the winning pair - Kramnik and Topalov.

agreement in principle of the contestants 
has been obtained. The prize fund will be 
not less than two million dollars.’
In view of FIDE's rejection of the traditional 
world championship system, my match with 
Karpov was no longer a unifying event, but a 
purely historic and competitive one: the world 
champion was due to meet a worthy oppo­
nent, who had gone through the FIDE qualify­
ing system. And whereas earlier, after my 
match with Anand, I put forward the usual 
condition - ‘with a 10-10 score the world 
champion retains his title’, now, to avoid 
losing my opponent, I decided to make a 
compromise. But Karpov too had to make a 
compromise in return, as otherwise we would 
have been unable to come to an agreement.
On the joint initiative of llyumzhinov and 
Makarov, Karpov and I met on 23 August 
1996 in the Kalmykia agency in Moscow. 
Almost immediately the two of us were left 
alone, and our face-to-face and later corre­
spondence discussions led within three weeks 
to the production of a very important (at that 
moment) unofficial agreement to a match, 
signed on 14 September by both contestants.
In it, among other things, it was stated that 
‘the match will be played for the title of world 
champion’, that ‘the match will be played 
outside the currently existing official organi­
sations, FIDE or PCA’, that ‘the status of the 
participants in the match are world cham­
pion and FIDE world champion’, and that ‘in 
the event of a drawn match, additional rapid 
games are to be played (4 games in 2 days); if 
they too result in a draw, two additional rapid

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
In the first two rounds, while Kramnik 
and I were being treated for colds, the Rus­
sian team crushed Finland and Bangladesh 
(both 3V2-V2). In the third round I turned out 
for a ‘white’ game with Lautier, still unwell 
and in a ‘groggy’ state after the shock in 
Geneva. In this condition the heightened 
attention of the fans was an added stress: I 
had not been in Yerevan since 1976 and I 
was there for the first time as world cham­
pion. After playing the opening badly (cf. 
Game No.22 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1975- 
1985, note to Black’s 12th move), I had to 
fight for a draw. But nevertheless Russia 
overcame France: Vh-Vh.
In the fourth round we confidently beat 
Germany 3-1, although I had another diffi­
cult draw - with Yusupov (cf. Game No.77 in 
Part II of Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov, 
note to Black’s 13th move). Then Russia 
defeated China and Armenia (both 2'h-V/i), 
but I, after a day’s rest, was unable to win 
against Akopian and I flamboyantly forced a 
draw by perpetual check (cf. Game No.98, 
note to White’s 14th move). The local specta­
tors applauded, thinking that this was a 
mark of respect for the Armenian commu­
nity, but in fact it was a forced measure.
In the seventh round I was finally able to 
concentrate and open my score with a win. 
My opponent was the 26-year-old Czech 
Grandmaster Zbynek Flracek.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three

21 ^
4! (Akopian-Mamedyarov, Dresden

Easy equality is also not promised by
13...i.d7 14 i-d3 or 13...Sg8 14 i.e2 (when 
14-b4? 15 £se4! or 14...fixg2? 15 i.f3 fig8 16 
<£sxd5l is bad for Black). However, the sharp 
move 13...b4 drives the knight along the 
desired route c3-e2-g3-h5.
14 ®e2 (not 14 exf6?l ixf6 15 #xb4 #c7, 
when Black has active play for the pawn)
14..

A difficult choice - White is better after
14.. .fxe5 15 fxe5 or 14...Sb8 15 f5 (15 #631?
and 
is ‘more positional’) I5...'irb6
(15...O-O?! 16 Sd3l) 16 fxe6 fxe6 17 ^ 4  with

dangerous one.

If I6...a4 again 17 g4! fxg4 18 f5 is strong,

17 g4!
After 17 h3 ^ 6 !  18 1Brxb6 fixb6 19 g4

and a slightly better endgame reached - not 
at all what White was hoping for.

with serious threats.

A tempting check. But the developing 19 
iLd3 Wb6 20 #14 exf5 21 Shfl was more 
interesting, or else the clamping 19 f6! iLf8 20 
£sg7+ Sxg7l? (20..Jb<g7?! 21 #xg4) 21 fxg7 
&.xg7 22 h3l, when Black has insufficient

19.. .±xf6 20 exf6 #d6 (again the best 
defence) 21 &.g2
‘A key move. White leaves the central d- 
and e-files open for his rooks. The routine 21 
iLd3 was worse on account of 21...exf5! 22 
#e3+ &d8 or 22 Shel+ <£f8 with unclear 
play' (Dokhoian). And the exchange 21 fxe6 
is pointless in view of 2l..Jtxe6! (pointed 
out by Stohl instead of the Informator
21.. .fxe6(?) 22 ^.e2).
21 Ac4!? was more shrewd, with the idea 
of 21..JLd7 22 Shel. True, after 21...<4>d8! 22 
fxe6 ±xe6 23 ^.xd5 ^.xd5 24 #xd5 #xd5 25 
Sxd5+ &c7 26 Sxa5 Sg6! it is unclear 
whether White can win this favourable 
double-rook endgame.
21.. .5.5?
This, the only obvious mistake by Black in 
the game, proves to be decisive. As the lesser 
evil Dokhoian and I suggested 21...Sb7(?l) 22 
#e3(?l) 4^18 23 #h6, but here after 23...'4>c7l 
White’s advantage altogether evaporates. 22 
fihel (22 fxe6!?) 22...-4>d8 23 Se5l Sb5 24 
#a7 is stronger, retaining a dangerous 
initiative (24...#c7? 25 #e3l).
But after 21...Sb5l (over-protecting the d5- 
pawn) Black would have managed to consoli­
date, and it would indeed not have been easy 
for me to achieve success: 22 Shel (nothing is 
given by either 22 fxe6 ±xe6, or 22 #d3 Sc5)
22.. .'4>d8! 23 #a7 #c7 24 #e3 #d6 or 23 Scl 
jk.d7 24 fxe6 (24 c4?! bxc3l) 24..JLxe6 25 c4 
bxc3 26 #xc3 Af5+, etc.
Now, however, White is able to carry out a 
spectacular concluding combination.
22 £xd5! icd7
22...exd5 23 #e3+ and #xg5 or 22...#xd5
23 #f4! is fatal, as is 22...&f8 23 #a7 (23 
#e3l?) 23...exd5 24 Sxd5l or 22...^.b7 23 
Axb7 (23 #e3l?) 23..#xd4 24 Ac6+1.
23 S h e l h6 (23...Sc8 24 #e4 and fxe6, while 
if 23-Sxf5, then 24 Axe6 #xd4 25 Jb(f5+ 
and Sxd4 is decisive) 24 fxe6 (24 #e4l?)
24...fxe6 25 #a7 1-0
In view of the murderous threat of ^.xe6.
As a result Russia crushed the Czechs 
(3V2-V2) and the team consolidated its lead­
ing position.
After this the quality of my play sharply 
improved. In my game from the next round 
with Alexey Shirov, who was then leading 
the Spanish team, I was able to carry out 
both an unusual positional idea in the 
opening and a pretty combinative stroke in 
the middlegame.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
Shirov far more often played 3 d4, not

ever, two years before this he had already 
given me this ‘soothing’ bishop check.

In order to play d2-d4 and after the ex­
change on d4 set up a 'Maroczy bind’. If 5 
0-0, then 5-£tf6 6 Sel ?Tc6 or immediately 
5-53c6 (excluding the variation 5~.^f6 6 e5). 
5—^c6 6 £*3 (6 0-0 or 6 d4 is also played, 
not allowing that which occurred in the 
game) 6...g6 7 d4
7...±g7!?
An interesting idea, which I devised at a 
summer training session in a game with 
Sergey Rublevsky. After the usual 7...cxd4 8 
•5^xd4 i.g7 apart from 9 i.e3 the dangerous 9
•?ide2 T)f6 io 0-0 followed by JLgS is possible, 
for example: 10...0-0 11 f3 a6 12 a4 2fc8 13 b3 
'B’dS 14 &hl •?Vl7 15 i.g5 (Kramnik-Gelfand, 
3rd match game, Sanghi Nagar 1994), or

JLh4 is no better, Oral-Kasparov, Prague 
(simul’) 2001) 15 b3, and White has some 
pressure (Shirov-J.Polgar, Vienna 1996).
True, soon instead of 10...0-0, a clever re­
source was found: 10...#e6!? 11 4bd5 1Brxe4 
12 ^c7+ &d7 13 ^xa8 #xc4! 14 ^b6+!? 
axb6 15 vTc3 Sa8 (I5...b5l?) 16 a4 ^e4 with 
quite good compensation for the exchange 
(Kasparov-The World, Internet 1999).
In any event, after 7..~i.g7 all that remains 
for White is to develop his bishop at e3 (8 
ji.e3 cxd4 9 £sxd4 ?Tf6, etc.) or cramp Black 
with d4-d5, which is what my surprised 
opponent did.
8 d5 i.xc3+!
The point of Black’s idea! He unexpectedly 
exchanges his strong bishop, but perma­
nently spoils White’s pawn structure and 
hopes to set up a blockaded position, as, for 
example, in the Nimzo-lndian Defence.

Shirov called this move ‘very strong’,

A serious positional mistake: the black

is insipid: 12...&f8!? 13 f4 £>h6 14 e5 £if5 
and ...h7-h5 or 14 Sf2 £sf7 and ...4g7.
Of course, the most energetic move was
the immediate 12 f4l, rejected by Alexey 
because of I 2...‘rih6! (12...0-0-0? 13 a4l, as in 
the Rublevsky-Ehlvest game). Now if 13 e5, 
then 13...«g4(?!) 14 #a4+(?!) #d7 15 #c2 
#f5 with equality would seem to be good, 
but after 14 Sf3l the black queen becomes 
uncomfortable: 14...0-0 15 e6 <£\f5 16 1Hrfl!, 
etc. Therefore 13...^f5 is correct, with the 
idea of ...0-0, or 14 e6 >liTo7 15 ®a4+ 4f8 and

ous, but nothing terrible for him is apparent.

If 13 Sbl, then 13...O-O-O is now accept­

of 14 Sb5! with the threat of &.b2 and Sal).
13.. .^h6 14 e5 0-0-0
Sharper than 14...0-0. After sinking into 
thought, Shirov realised that White’s attack 
had come to a standstill, and so he decided to 
at least make an active move with his rook.
15 S b l £)f5
AfteT the game I lamented that I did not 
play more forcefully here - 15...Shf81? with the 
idea of 16 e6 f5l and ,..^g4(g8)-f6, with excel­
lent prospects: I would be threatening either 
...■££4, or ...&c7, ...Sb8, ...a7-a6 and ...b6-b5, or 
...h7-h5, ..-Sh8 and ...h5-h4, etc., and White 
would only be able to ‘stand and wait’. How­
ever, the knight move to f5 is also not bad.

This pseudo-activity loses Black all his ad­

was far stronger (for example, 17 e6 h5l). It 
was precisely this that Shirov was afraid of

Indeed, here after I8...2he8 Black has a

Suddenly the white pieces have come

weaknesses - the pawns on d6 and f6. Not

long time and in the end I found a lengthy 
drawing combination.

In my opinion, this is more interesting 
than 19...h5 (I9..#xc4?! 20 ^xf6 is worse for

According to Shirov, he was absolutely 
sure that I had miscalculated somewhere 
and that the game was over. But...
26.. .We4!!
A unique situation: Black is the exchange 
and a pawn down, and he also leaves both 
knights en prise! I was so proud of this 
amazing move, that I even forgot about the 
vexing lapse I6...£)h4?, which spoiled my 
original positional idea.
By 26...£)df3+? 27 4 fl #d7 28 i.g3 or

(it was this that Shirov had not seen) 31 ^ e l 
(31 <&e2?! £)e4 is worse) 3l...£ie4, forcing a 
draw in the minor piece endgame.
After playing 27 ji.g3, Shirov offered a 
draw. I replied: ‘But I have a perpetual, can I 
think a while?’. And after five minutes I 
satisfied myself that after 27...£shf3+ 28 <&hl

agreed (Vj-’/j). A gripping struggle!
We overcame the Spanish (2V2-1V2) and 
then continued our winning streak, to which 
I made a fair contribution, winning four 
games in a row.
In the ninth round I had another sharp 
Sicilian duel with Topalov, who, playing 
White, did not make any obvious mistakes, 
but he acted not altogether certainly (cf. 
Game No.37, note to White’s 13th move), 
and it all concluded, as the press wrote, with 
a ‘Kasparov-style vendetta’.
This crushing win over the Bulgarian 
team (3V2-V2) essentially decided the destiny 
of the gold medals, and we drew our next 
two matches, with Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(in a Scotch I overwhelmed Ivan Sokolov - cf. 
Game N0.38, note to White’s 9th move), and 
Ukraine.
In the 12th round I met the now mature 
and already very experienced leader of the 
Israeli team Ilya Smirin, against whom I had

replied only 6...e6 (Game Nos.66, 74) or 6...e5 
(Game Nos.45, 93). But beginning with the 
rapidplay tournament in Geneva I began 
regularly employing 6...®g4, fathomed out 
the ideas of this dynamic variation, greatly 
enriched its theory and gained several 
memorable victories with it.

Thanks to this win we defeated Israel, and 
the following day, thanks to my first win 
with White against Yermolinsky (revenge for 
the ‘childhood injury’!) also the Americans. 
At the finish Russian beat Iceland by the 
same I'/i-l'/i score and by a respectable 
margin took first place.
The best results on board l  were posted by 
A1 Modiahki (8 out of 10), Kasparov (7 out of 
9) and Ivanchuk (8V2 out of 11). I commented 
as follows on this paradoxical picture: ‘In 
announcing the best results on individual 
boards, very strange things occur. In a diffi­
cult battle I can defeat Ivanchuk, but I am 
quite unable to beat a player from Qatar, who 
plays in the region of the 80th board with 
opponents who are not even of simultaneous 
standard for me or Ivanchuk. And in the end 
the winner of this ‘tournament’ is declared 
the prize-winner on board l! This is some 
kind of naive joke with respect to the top- 
class grandmasters fighting one another.'
At the FIDE Congress taking place at the 
same time, llyumzhinov consolidated his hold 
on the Presidential post. It was then that his
156

Short, Anand and Las Palmas
coalition with Kouatly and Karpov broke up, 
after which llyumzhinov finally decided that 
he had no need to organise a unification 
match, and that it was better to get rid of the 
‘champion’s diktat’ by means of the knock­
out world championship. But for the moment 
this did not greatly concern me, since an 
‘unscheduled’ match with Karpov was al­
ready taking shape: for our sixth duel some 
excellent sponsors had been found - the 
organisers of the December super-tourna­
ment in Las Palmas, who in the autumn of 
1997 were also proposing to hold there a 
match ‘for the absolute championship’.
Soon Karpov stated in an interview: 'Of 
course, the match is necessary - it is awaited 
by millions of chess fans, and it should also 
settle all of the accounts in my chess relations 
with Garry. Therefore, when I won against 
Kamsky and once again became the legiti­
mate world champion, I immediately made 
contact and entered into discussions with my 
old opponent.’
I also commented on this topic: ‘Whether 
Karpov likes it or not, a match without 
Kasparov cannot be considered a match for 
the title of world champion. Today, whether I 
like it or not, before any qualifying cycle is 
organised I have to finalise the negotiations 
with Karpov, because in the eyes of the 
public he is regarded as my obvious oppo­
nent in a match for the chess title. In my 
view, FIDE has forfeited the moral and 
financial right to the world championship, 
since it has simply opted out of staging it.’
Towards the end of the Olympiad I again 
sensed my former chess strength, and this 
heralded a surge in Las Palmas and Linares. 
By that time order had been restored to my 
chaotic, crazy life of the early 1990s, when I 
was battling on several fronts - FIDE, the 
Russian Chess Federation, and a protracted 
divorce process. Finally, calm was restored
and my every-day life was stabilised. Back in 
the spring of 1995, at the concluding ban­
quet of the Tal Memorial Tournament, I met 
Riga student Yulia Volk. In 1996 she moved 
to my place in Moscow, and on 28 October 
our son Vadim was bom.
Supreme Court
Double-Round Super-Tournament in Las 
Palmas (8-21 December 1996): 1. Kasparov - 
6V2 out of 10; 2. Anand - 5V2; 3-4. Topalov and 
Kramnik - 5; 5-6. Ivanchuk and Karpov - 4.
Las Palmas 1996 was undoubtedly an his­
toric chess event, comparable with a ‘su­
preme court’ and strongly resembling the 
epochal AVRO Tournament (1938), where 
Alekhine and Capablanca were opposed by 
six young pretenders to the title. True, the 
modem organisers, aiming to achieve the 
highest, unprecedented 2lst category for 
the tournament, did not invite eight, but 
only six of the top-rated players in the world 
- Kasparov, Karpov, Kramnik, Anand, Topa­
lov and Ivanchuk, whereas for a ‘full com­
plement’ it was lacking Kamsky (after losing 
his match to Karpov, he left the chess scene 
for a long time), Gelfand and Shirov.
‘With them we could indeed have had a 
review of all the real challengers compared 
with the ‘old champions", wrote the Russian 
journalist Yuri Vasiliev. ‘However, in contrast 
to their prototypes, the ‘upgraded Alekhine’ 
and the 'upgraded Capablanca' are intending 
soon to play a match against each other. To 
avoid possible false rumours, Kasparov said 
at a press conference before the start that a 
comparison of this “tournament of six" with 
the world championship was unfair, since by 
tradition the chess title can be won only in a 
match.’
But the importance of victory in such a 
tournament was exceptionally high, and the
157

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
players felt the weight of responsibility. But, 
of course, the experts and the fans were 
intrigued by the performance of the two ‘Ks’, 
especially in the light of our negotiations 
with the Spanish organisers about our 
forthcoming match, which were conducted 
through our lawyers at the start of the event.
In this ridiculously nervy atmosphere I 
was fortunate to start well - with Black I 
outplayed Topalov, who surprised me with 1 
d4. A closed Catalan led to an equal position. 
On the 25th move Veselin went wrong, but 
with my 28th move I lost my advantage and 
got into severe time-trouble. Nevertheless 
my opponent did not play accurately 
enough to extinguish the activity of my 
pieces in an interesting rook ending.
In the second round I again had Black and 
I easily gained a draw with Ivanchuk. In the 
third round KTamnik surprised me with a 
King’s Indian Defence, which he had pre­
pared for the tournament, and he also easily 
gained a draw. That day Anand beat Ivan­
chuk, after which he was sharing the lead 
with me - we each had 2 out of 3.
And then came the fourth round, and a 
crucial encounter with Vishy Anand, my 
‘Geneva conqueror' (to avoid anyone playing 
three successive games with the same colour, 
the fourth and fifth rounds weTe inter­
changed). Makarychev: 'The game of last 
year’s opponents in the match for the world 
championship was the focus of attention. 
Garry played the opening simply splendidly.’

‘A splendid move, concluding the opening

that is what I thought, as did my trainer, 
who in Informator even attached two ex­
clamation marks to this move: the bishop 
occupies an attacking diagonal and estab­
lishes control over the key d5-point.
However, 16 Sh3l? with the threat of Ac4 
also deserved consideration - this would 
have denied Black a defence which he had in 
the game (l6...2c8), for example: I6...£sxd5
17 ®xd5 £)d4?l 18 jLd3 g6 19 f4l or 17...1fd7
18 c3 with an appreciable advantage for 
White. But, carried away by the plan of 
creating a direct attack on the king, I decided 
to defer for a short time the switching of the 
rook to h3. And as soon as I placed the 
bishop on c4, I suddenly sensed intuitively: 
now something will happen...
I6...£)d4?
And it happened: this obvious move loses 
by force! In vain the knight hurries to take

20 JLd5?
Of course, in the first instance 1 looked at

or 20...d5? 21 gxf5 (21 ^.b3l?) 21,..dxc4 22 
#h6, etc., I concentrated on the main varia­
tion - 20...#08 21 jLdS £>h4 22 HglLwith the 
deadly threat of 'BTiB and g4-g5. Since
22.. .2b8 23 IT16 I t s  24 c4 or 23...2b4 24 c4l 
is bad for Black, there only remains 22...g5 23

But I couldn’t find what to do after

27 Axa8 Sxa8 28 #d5 2f8 I didn’t see the 
only knock-out blow 29 JLh61. This was, after 
all, the 10th move of the variation (inciden­
tally, Anand also did not see it). This missed 
spectacular win was pointed out after the 
game by Dokhoian, who had looked at it 
with a computer.

I myself sensed that 20 g4 should have 
won, and had I played this, the result would 
have been a brilliant game. But the difficulty 
of the given situation was that I also had 
another tempting move - 20 iLd5 with an 
attack on the rook: the threat of g2-g4 forces 
Black to give up the exchange, and White 
obtains a technically won position.
Nevertheless, 20 JLd5 deserves a question 
mark. After making it, I was psychologically 
upset, since I was vexed and unable to 
forgive myself for rejecting 20 g4.
20...H5!
An instant reply: while I was thinking 
about my 20th move, it all became clear to 
Anand. It was noticeable that he calmed 
down somewhat.

A mind-boggling game!
It was a pity that I did not manage to cre­
ate a ‘canvas’ and crush a direct rival, but 
there was no time for me to grieve: at the 
very finish of the first cycle I had to play 
Karpov with Black. At that moment nearly all 
the contestants still retained chances of 
overall victory: Anand and I had 2'/i out of 4, 
with Karpov, Kramnik and Ivanchuk on 2.
Our game was preceded by two free days, 
and here Karpov allowed himself to be 
unjustifiably diverted. With the tournament 
in full swing he flew to Paris for the opening 
of a junior tournament! From the competi­
tive point of view this was a suicidal step, 
comparable perhaps with Capablanca’s trip 
to Leningrad during the 1925 Moscow 
International Tournament - it will be re­
membered that the Cuban gave a difficult 
simultaneous display in the city on the Neva, 
and on his return he suffered a defeat. 
Miraculously, Karpov did not lose to me, but 
he came a cropper in the second half of the 
tournament...

After this we spent a long time analyzing 
our 164th game on the empty stage... Of
163

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
course, it is hard to call it an entertaining 
game, but it was of great competitive and 
psychological 
significance. 
Many 
even 
considered it to be the key game of the 
entire event, since Karpov was playing White 
and in the event of success he could have 
fought for first place. Therefore our 
‘thoughtfulness’ and our mutual mistakes 
can be put down to the exceptional impor­
tance of the result. I most probably missed 
the winning move 40...e5 for the reason that 
sub-consciously I was happy with a draw: 
after three games with Black, ‘plus one’ in 
the first half of the event seemed to me to be 
quite a decent result.
Meanwhile, at the time when we were 
just exchanging the queens, on the floor 
above the playing hall llyumzhinov was 
giving a press conference, at which he 
announced the decision of the latest FIDE 
Presidential Board meeting. Finally it was 
officially declared that the new-formula 
world championship (on the knock-out 
system) would take place in exactly a year’s 
time, its prize fund would be 5 million 
dollars, and the main sponsor would be 
Kalmykia.
From the press: ‘The championship has 
again been deferred - now from spring 1997 
to December, evidently in order to allow 
Karpov and Kasparov to decide on their 
match, but searching questions on this topic 
are avoided very simply by the professional 
diplomat llyumzhinov: "/ am the President of 
FIDE and I answer only for my organisation".’
In the meantime Anand had also drawn, 
and we were caught by Ivanchuk, who 
defeated Kramnik. The leading trio was on 3 
out of 5.
The next day the second half of the tour­
nament began, and Anand lost to Kramnik, 
Ivanchuk drew with Karpov, as did I, to my 
vexation, with Topalov, who answered 1 e4
with the unexpected l...eS (cf. Came No.14, 
note to Black's 7th move). Four rounds 
before the end, the outcome of the tourna­
ment was still absolutely unclear: Ivanchuk 
and I had y /2 out of 6, with Karpov, Kramnik 
and Anand on 3. It need hardly be said how 
competitively important was my next en­
counter with Vassily Ivanchuk, against 
whom I had not won in ‘classical’ play for 
nearly three years.
Dokhoian: ‘Understandably, both the play­
ers and their helpers experienced extreme 
pressure.’

The position that has arisen is of the same 
type as in a line of the Queen’s Gambit, well 
known to me from games with Karpov 
(Game No.75 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1975- 
1985; Game No.22 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 
1986-87) and Short (Game No.25 in Part II of 
Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov). White 
has conceded the advantage of the two 
bishops, but he has created pressure on the
a2-g8 diagonal and has the potential threat 
of the d4-d5 breakthrough.
20...Ae6
The most logical. My Informator sugges­
tion 20...#a5(?) is incorrect because of 21 
#f4! #f5 22 #63! Ae6 23 d5 Axds 
(23...cxd5? 24 g4) 24 £sxd5 cxd5 25 Sxd5, 
when White has a dangerous initiative.

Continuing the series of instant moves 
(virtually the longest in my ‘classical’ career). 
After this thrust Vassily became nervous: he 
thought that by ...Ae6 Black had neutralised 
the pressure, and suddenly it transpired that 
he still had unresolved problems. Having a 
decent advantage on the clock (30-40 min­
utes), Ivanchuk began thinking for long 
periods and soon he was in desperate time- 
trouble.
21.. .cxd5 22 £sxd5 Sc8

such a risky decision.
29 We2?!
The insipid 29 ‘i ’hl?! would also have 
given Black an important tempo to consoli­
date with the unexpected move 29...Sc8! 
(and if 30 We2, then 30...Wd6 31 Wa6 Wb8, if 
there is nothing better).
The most energetic was 29 We4! with the 
threat of £sf4: after 29...&g8 30 Wa4! or
29...Wb8 30 £sxf6 &xf6 31 Ad5 White has an 
obvious advantage. Therefore perhaps the 
best chance would have been a queen 
sacrifice - 29-Sc8 30 £tf4 Wxdl+! 31 Axdl 
gxf4 32 Wxf4 £id7 with the desperate hope 
of constructing a fortress. But to find this in 
extreme time-trouble would have been 
practically unreal! This is also confirmed by 
the opponent’s reaction to my somewhat 
mysterious move.
29...^h7?
‘The culminating moment. After passing 
through numerous mined squares unharmed 
Ivanchuk, in terrible time-trouble, cracks 
under the pressure and commits an irrepara­

curred precisely due to the lightning speed of 
my moves.
29...Wd6? 30 We8 was also bad, but 29...a5 
would have enabled Black to hold on, and if 
30 a4 (fixing the weakness of the b6-pawn), 
suggested by Dokhoian and me, then
30...Sc8!. Or the immediate 29...Sc8!, cover­
ing the eighth rank with the intention of

The machine move 35 .&.f7! was also deci­
sive, only not the greedy 35 ®xa7?, since

gain counterplay.
35...a5
35—Wf8 36 Wxa7 and 35...Wg7 36 Wb8+ 
or 36 ±f7! are also hopeless for Black.
36i.e6
Here a good dozen moves would have 
won. Black lost on time (l-O), without man­
aging to play 36...£rf8 (when there would 
have followed 37 #xb6, etc.).
A very important win, which eliminated a 
dangerous rival: after this Ivanchuk was as 
though substituted and he scored only one 
more half-point. In this blood-thirsty round 
there were no draws: Anand crushed Karpov 
in spectacular style, while Kramnik lost to 
the resurgent Topalov. A decisive separation 
of the leading group occurred: Kasparov - 
4V2 out of 7; Anand - 4; Ivanchuk - 3Vr; 
Topalov, Kramnik and Karpov - 3.
Then, after a free day, all the games ended 
in draws. Against Kramnik I ‘sounded the 
retreat’ in the Lasker Defence to the Queen’s 
Gambit, but in the end I saved the game 
literally by a miracle. My ‘white’ duel with 
Karpov in the ninth round also took a very 
difficult, nervy and uneven course.
Roshal: ‘An interesting intrigue developed 
around virtually the main game of the entire 
tournament. The sceptics asserted: Kasparov 
will not risk his sole leadership, while Karpov 
(especially with Black) will be inhibited by the 
risk of damaging the prestige of the future 
match between them. The meticulous Kas­
parov appeared in his full regalia, whereas 
without a tie Karpov looked imposing and 
even complacent... The game proved unfor­
gettable, especially its finish, which took place 
in a fearful time scramble.’

This instinctive defence against iLd6 is a 
fatal mistake in a good position. ‘Black is the

(Dokhoian). Karpov had only one minute left 
and he no longer had time to look for a 
different, active defence: 32..Jtxe4 33 iLd6

Now Black’s queenside pawns cannot be

not let his advantage slip.’ (Dokhoian).

cided by the a-pawn.
Roshal: 'The nine culminating moves in 
this game literally shook the chess world, 
divided into supporters of the two contest­
ants. Right to the end of the tournament in 
the press centre, and much later elsewhere, 
these time-trouble moves were repeated. It is 
simply pointless to talk here about good or 
bad luck: Karpov was indeed in poor form.’
Makarychev: ‘Yes, to play as well at the age 
of 45 as one did at 25 is practically impossi­
ble.’
A round before the finish I had moved a 
point ahead of Anand and was assured, at 
the least, of a share of first place. And on the 
last day I had Black against Vishy and I quite 
confidently gained a draw in a sharp branch 
of the Scheveningen (cf. Game No.37, note to 
White's 13th move).
Thus the world champion took his ‘lawful’ 
first place, while the FIDE champion shared 
last place, being the only player not to score 
a single win. As a result the Kasparov-Karpov 
match was sharply devalued: the sponsors 
were unwilling to invest several million 
dollars on the clash between the winner of 
the tournament and an outsider.
This veritable supreme court led to a re­
alignment at the top of world chess and 
drew the line under the ‘two Ks’ era. The era 
of my confrontation with the young began.

Chapter Two
Second Peak
Battle for Prestige
International Tournament in Linares (3-16 
February 1997): 1. Kasparov - 8'/2 out of 11; 
2. Kramnik - 7V2; 3-4. Adams and Topalov -
6V2; 5. J.Polgar - 6; 6. Anand - 5V2; 7-8. 
Ivanchuk and Gelfand - 5; 9. Nikolic - 4Vr, 
10. Dreev - 4; 11-12. Sbirov and Piket - y /2.
Despite the dramatic outcome in Las Pal­
mas, the chess world entered 1997 still 
expecting a sixth Kasparov-Karpov match.
‘After Karpov's failure the number of 
those wishing to stage our match has dimin­
ished: perhaps this will also affect the prize 
fund’, I stated soon afterwards. ‘But even so, 
a match is the only possible way of contest­
ing the champion’s title, and at the moment 
there is no more lawful challenger than 
Karpov. He has to his credit successes which 
today no one can match: from Linares 1994 
to the match with Kamsky. I hope that our 
match will take place in the autumn of 1997 
and that by the end of Feburary, after the 
super-tournament in Linares, we will decide 
on the venue and the final conditions.’
But the attitude of potential sponsors to 
this match was also influenced by the next 
‘chess Wimbledon’, which was revived after 
a year’s break (in honour of this a super­
prize for the winner was even wheeled into 
the hall of the Anibal Hotel - a Sukuzi jeep).
All the Las Palmas contestants arrived in 
Linares, apart from Karpov, who totally 
ignored numerous invitations, which of­
fended the Spanish organisers. In an open 
letter to the FIDE champion, Senor Rentero 
stated: ‘You are hiding... But it is interesting 
for me to see how you intend to sell your 
match with Kasparov for 400 million pesetas. 
After all, all the sponsors were awaiting your 
appearance in Linares. The fact that you are 
not playing in Linares is bound to have 
consequences: thus Cadilso Insular (the 
government of the Canary Islands - G.K.) will 
not sponsor you.’
For Vishy Anand and me the start in 
Linares was a continuation of the finish in 
Las Palmas: we again played with the same 
colours - and again it was a tense duel in a 
Scheveningen!

Only this is a novelty. ‘Without trying to

the resulting insecurity of the knight on c3

This is the point! ‘The strongest and most

has no way of opposing the inexorable 
strengthening of Black’s attack’ (Dokhoian).
At this point we each had about 10 min­
utes left. Glancing at my opponent, I saw his 
face suddenly change. All was clear to An­
and! And since the time of our match I knew 
that after a sharp change of scene he would 
no longer be able to play at full strength...

Time-tTouble confusion - the capture of 
the pawn loses instantly! 39 Sel g4 40 &d2 
(but not the Informator 40 1i rc4+(?) Ifxc4 41

even here after 40...h4 41 £rfl Sa8 with the

A knock-out: 42 £ig3 £ixg3+ or 42 f6 JLd8, 
etc. ‘A brilliant finish, and quite a good claim 
by Kasparov for victory in the tournament!’ 
(MakaTychev).
This loss sapped Anand’s energy, and he 
emerged from a minus score only at the very 
finish. As for me, such a striking win should 
have been inspiring, but I suddenly came to 
a halt - I made three draws. In the second
round, again playing Black, I escaped with 
difficulty against Dreev, in the third I failed 
to finish off Gelfand, and in the fourth I 
almost lost to Piket, who in a King’s Indian 
employed a novelty with a pawn sacrifice (cf. 
Game No.77 in Part II of Garry Kasparov on 
Garry Kasparov, note to White’s 13th move).
By the free day after four rounds I had just 
'plus one’ and was half a point behind the 
leaders - Kramnik, Adams and Polgar. My 
play was unimpressive, and I urgently 
needed to break the sequence. The basis of 
my winning run was laid by the game with 
Predrag Nikolic.

Ubilava’s aggressive move, which first 
occurred in Kasparov-Anand (8th match 
game, New York 1995). Before that 9-0-0-0 
(Game No.70 in Part II of Carry Kasparov on 
Cany Kasparov) or 9~.g6 (Game No.65) was 
mainly played.

10.. .1.g7 11 i.b2

After ...g7-g5 it is more logical to play

12 £>d2
Natural development with the idea of 
0-0-0 and h2-h4 or f2-f4. It is weaker to play
12 JLg2?! Bae8 13 0-0 jLxeS, but the imme­
diate 12 h4 Bae8 13 'idll, defending against

12.. .f6

Black. I2...£)b4!? is more critical - I judged
13 0-0-0 £>xa2+ 14 ^ b l <£)b4 15 h4 to be in 
White’s favour, but later I realised that after
15.. .d5 16 exd6 (l6  hxg5?l i.c8!) I6 ...# x e2  17 
A x e 2  cxd6 18 hxg5 A c 8 both sides have 
chances, and the im m ediate 15....&C8! is 
even better, with the idea of 16 hxg5 d5 or 
16 £>e4 g4 with equality.
However, instead of queenside castling, 
13 £rf3! (threatening a2-a3) 13-C5 14 A g 2  
d5 15 0-0 is stronger. It is hard to say how 
much weaker I2...f6 is than this move, but it 
allows White to begin pursuing the weak­
ened black king.

The crux of White’s plan. At this we con­
cluded our analysis, with the cheerful con­
clusion: White has a dangerous attack. 
Whereas in the event of the timid 14 'A’dl? 
Black would have seized the initiative:

Sxf2 18 l.e2 e3 19 Ba2 (19 Bfl? fixfl+ 20

etc.
14.. .g4
Avoiding the opening of the h-file. It also 
made sense to offer the exchange of queens 
- 14...®e8!?. After 15 ®xe8 2axe8 16 0-0-0 
£)xa2+ 17 <&bl £)b418 £ie4 fxe5 19 Bxd7l (if

equality) 19...^.c8 20 Bxc7 ^.f5 21 iLg2 gxh4 
(21...^d3? 22 jLa3) 22 Bxh4 Bd8 Black would 
have equalised.
And yet 15 hxg5! WxhS 16 Sxh5 fxe5 17 
<4>e2 with the intention of JLh3 would have 
left White with the better prospects: 17...£)c2 
18 Bel £)d4+ 19 JLxd4 exd4 20 Bel! or 17...e4 
18 JLxg7 <4>xg7 19 .&h3 (my earlier 19 JLg2 d5
20 Bahl is also good) 19...d5 20 2h6.

An unexpected reply, with the threat of 
a2-a3, trapping the knight: now 15...fxe5? 16 
a3 e4 no longer works because of 17 '8fxg4 
£)d3 18 l.xd3 exd3 19 Bel Wf7 20 Bel and

15...C5 (or 15...1.b7 16 a3 c5!) 16 a3
16.. .£ic6?
Nikolic cracks under the pressure. Inter­
posing l6..JLb7l was far more resilient, for 
example:
1) 17 Bgl £)c6 18 iLd3 h6! (instead of
18.. .f5? 19 JLxf5, as given in Informator) 19 
exf6 (in contrast to the position which could 
have occurred in the game, the bishop has 
moved from a6 and 19 ®g6 is now weak)

2) 17 axb4l? ^.xhl 18 iLd3 - this ex­
change sacrifice was suggested by many 
commentators, but after I8...h6 19 ®xg4! 
(with the threat of f2-f3; the Informator 19 
®g6 fxe5, allowing equality, is weaker)
19.. JLb7 20 exf6 Bxf6 21 Axf6 ®xf6 22 Ba5 
cxb4 a lengthy battle lies ahead, and it is 
unclear whether White will have any advan­
tage.

The resistance would have been pro­

The final touch, after which Black re­
signed (l-O).
In the meantime Polgar defeated Dreev 
and became the sole leader - 4 out of 5. 
Kramnik, Adams and I remained half a step 
behind.
The next day I had Black against an ag­
gressively inclined Veselin Topalov.
Game 39
V.Topalov-G.Kasparov
Linares, 6th Round, 10.02.1997 
Queen's Gambit D35
1C4
Earlier Topalov played only l  e4 against 
me, but in Las Palmas 1996 he suddenly 
went 1 d4, and now - another surprise! After 
some thought, I also decided to surprise my 
opponent with a rare (for me) reply.
I...e6 2 4k3 d5 3 d4 ± e 7 4 cxd5 exd5 5 £f4 
6 e3 (6 Wc2 0-0 7 e3 c5l - Game No.72 in 
K asparov vs. K arpov 1 9 7 5-1985) 6...^.f5i?
Ubilava’s gambit variation, which came 
into fashion after the 12th game of my 
fourth match with Karpov (1987). Before 
that attention was focused on 6...0-0 7 £sf3 
(Game No.74 in K asparov vs. K arpov 1975- 
1985) or 7 ^.d3 (Game No.14 in Part II of 
C arry K asparov on C arry Kasparov).
7 Wb3
Topalov accepts the challenge. The insipid 
7 £ige2 0-0 would have been a psychological 
concession on White’s part (Game No.39 in 
K asparov vs. K arpov 1986-87).
7 - £ ic6
As I played this I feverishly tried to re­
member the variations with the sacrifice of 
the b7-pawn.
If 8 Wxby, then 8...£ib4, and in numerous 
analyses in the mid-1980s we did not find 
any advantage for White after either 9 Bel 
0-0 (Ubilava played this three times), or 9 
^.b5+ 4^8 10 <^d2 a6 (Salov-Timoshchenko,
179

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
Irkutsk 1986). Probably the most solid is 8 a3 
£)a5 (Gavrikov-Ubilava, Tbilisi 1983) 9 #32!? 
(an old idea of Timoshchenko, which was 
first seen in Flear-Komeev, Nice 2000). 
However, something unimaginable awaited.
8g4l?
‘This position was thoroughly studied 
during the Karpov-Kasparov match (1985), 
and 8 g4 was rejected by both teams of 
trainers’ (Ubilava). Through surprise I fell 
into a slight stupor: ‘Is it really possible to 
play this?’ I wondered. It turns out that it is!
8...£ixg4!
8..JLc8 9 h3 is worse (Morozevich-Oni- 
schuk, Reggio Emilia 2010/11), as is 8..JLxg4 
(which I rejected intuitively, having decided 
that the bishop should remain on f5) 9 #xb7, 
and Black fails to equalise after either 9.. Jtd7 
10 ik.xc7 (Fridman-Azarov, Jurmala (rapid) 
2012), or 9-..£>b410 Bel!, for example:
1) 10..Jtf5?! (Aleksandrov-Dobrowolski,

9 £sxd5?
A serious oversight. Black is also better 
after 9 a3? (Aleksandrov-Azmaiparashvili, 
Groningen 1997) 9..~&h4! 10 jLg3 0-0 or
10..JLxg3 11 hxg3 £>e7, while 9 #xb7 is

jLxc7 #c8 12 ,&c6 £sxc6 13 #xc6 Sb8 14 
£sxd5 Sxb2 15 £sxe7 £sxf2! and ,..^d3+. But 
9 #xd5! is stronger, for example:
1) 9-..#xd5 10 £ixd5 ±b4+ l l  <^xb4 ^xb4 
12 Scl c6 13 a3 (Wojtaszek-Onischuk, 
Poikovsky 2012) or 10...0-0-0 11 ^xe7+ £ixe7 
12 Scl £}d5 13 -&g3 (Najer-Azarov, Czech 
League 2013), and in both cases White has 
slightly the better endgame;
2) 9...#c8 (recommended by me after the 
game) 10 #g2 0-0 (I0...£sf6!?) 11 e4 (ll 
0-0-0!?,

2011), but 14...h5! 15 #g3 £sxd4 is correct, 
with two pawns for the piece and unclear 
complications.
At any event, the 8 g4 thrust is currently 
of interest and it leads to very complicated 
play.

have faced a difficult defence a pawn down.

After six rounds the leading group com­
prised Kasparov, Kramnik and Polgar - 41/2; 
Adams - 4. But the ‘crunch’ seventh round 
finally determined the two leading contend­
ers for first place: Kramnik beat Polgar, and I 
won against Adams, who, like Ivanchuk in 
Las Palmas, risked employing the Alekhine 
Defence (cf. Game No.35, note to Black’s 4th 
move).
After scoring three wins in a row I was 
also eager for ‘blood’ in the eighth round, 
playing Black against Ivanchuk, who was on 
‘minus three’. And I achieved an excellent 
position, but in a time scramble I over­
stepped the mark and allowed a very strong 
tactical stroke. Yuri Vasiliev: ‘Kasparov was 
crushed and dismayed. He lost on time in

what was now a completely hopeless posi­
tion. In an impotent rage Garry clenched his 
fists, shook his head, as though wanting to 
cast off a delusion, and again and again 
cursed himself under his breath.'
Meanwhile Kramnik made a draw and 
moved half a point ahead. The following day 
I cleanly outplayed Judit Polgar, but my rival 
defeated Dreev and maintained the status 
quo. Two rounds before the finish Kramnik 
had 7 out of 9, with me on 6'A.
In the tenth round my opponent was 
Alexey Shirov - by general opinion a highly 
inventive and brilliant player, but also 
uncompromising, who sometimes allowed 
himself to be caught by a counterattack. I 
remember having a terrible night before the 
game: in a local restaurant there was an 
incredibly noisy wedding, and it was quite 
impossible to sleep. That, however, did not 
affect my fighting mood.

for a large-scale battle, avoided exchanges

play c2-c4(c3). 15 £>de2l? (Lanka-Rogozenko, 
Kishinev 1998) was a good alternative.

After this win I caught up with Kramnik 
(he quickly drew with Anand). We now had 
7V2 out of 10 - one and a half points more 
than our closest pursuers.
Mikhail Gurevich: ‘The last round became
186

Second Peak
the culmination of Linares 1997. The fate of 
the first two places in this exceptionally 
prestigious tournament was decided in the 
game between the two leaders. I am sure that 
money was not the main thing at stake in 
this game: it was not the Suzuki jeep or the 
$10,000 difference in the prizes that the 
players were thinking about before the start. 
Above all it was a battle for prestige!’
In the event of a draw and a share of first 
place, the tournament winner was to be 
decided not by the Berger coefficient, but 
simply by discarding the results against the 
player who finished last. Before the 11th 
round this player was Shirov, who had lost to 
me and drawn with Kramik. Therefore in his 
game with me it seemed that Kramnik 
should be satisfied with a draw (in the 
course of the round, however, everything 
was turned on its head: Shirov was caught 
by Piket, and now it was I who could be 
satisfied with a draw), but I was aiming to 
win ‘to order’ against this difficult opponent, 
against whom I had an equal score in ‘classi­
cal’ play: 2-2 with seven draws.

Nimzo-lndian Defence E59
ld 4
In the preceding rounds I played only l  e4, 
but that day I was afraid of the drawing 
tendencies of the Petroff Defence, which my 
opponent had in fact just begun employing 
(Hubner-Kramnik, Frankfurt (rapid) 1996).
I...£sf6 2 c4 e6
A surprise! Of course, Dokhoian and I had 
prepared for Kramnik’s usual openings - the 
Meran (Came No.27) and the King’s Indian
which occurred in Las Palmas 1996. But the 
Nimzo-lndian had not previously occurred in 
his games. It is probable that my opponent’s 
second, Sergey Dolmatov, had this flexible 
defence in mind when before the game he 
expressed his confidence: ‘Volodya will make 
a draw’.
Incidentally, from his youth Kramnik was 
a splendid psychologist and he always 
keenly sensed his opponent’s state of mind. 
Thus here, feeling that I was bursting with 
energy, instead of sharp variations he delib­
erately chose an opening of which he even 
had less knowledge, merely in order to avoid 
a direct confrontation and not allow me a 
clear initiative.
3 £k3 i-b4 4 e3
A surprise in reply, which took me just 
five minutes (after the game with Ivanchuk I 
forced myself to play more quickly). My 
opponent was probably expecting 4 ^c2, my 
usual move at that time (Came Nos.4, 68, 90, 
91, 97,106).
4.. .0-0 (4...C5 5 £*e2 - Game No.39 in Part I of

On encountering a surprise, Kramnik fol­

10 # 02, having restricted White’s options, he 
returned to the main line - 10...dxc4 11

,&d3 or l l  iLb2 (cf. Game N0.52, note to 
White’s 10th move). Although I had not 
previously employed this variation, I had 
done a little analysis of one of the compara­
tively rare lines...
11 JLa2
‘In order to conclusively take the oppo­
nent away from his analysis’ (Makarychev). 
In playing this, I was hoping that in an 
unfamiliar situation my opponent would 
feel uncertain and would play cautiously 
where he needed to show more initiative. 
That was indeed what happened, and after 
White’s success in this game the popularity 
of the variation rose sharply.
Here Kramnik thought for a long time: he 
was obviously not prepared for this turn of 
events.
11.. .b6
A rare move - and precisely in the spirit of 
'avoiding a direct confrontation’. In Gelfand- 
Korchnoi (Horgen 1994), a game played 
before my very eyes, the topical ll...e5 12 h3! 
occurred, and after 12...b61? 13 ®c2?l e4 14 
£sg5 -&a6 Black seized the initiative (Game 
N0.46 in Part V of My Great Predecessors).
Later after 12 h3 Dokhoian and I looked at 
the old reply 12...e4 and the currently fash­
ionable 12..JLf5, but mainly Korchnoi’s
12.. .b6, after which the main reply became

Black nevertheless needs to attack the

again stopped to think. No more was prom­

did indeed deserve consideration.
AfteT obtaining two bishops against two 
knights I overestimated the benefits of my 
position. ‘Having worked for several years 
with Garry, I know how much he respects 
bishops. He likes to repeat the joke: “The

truth. The champion is able to manoeuvre 
skilfully with bishops with the aim of 
activating them’ (M.Gurevich).
However, in my joy I was unable to find a 
precise plan foT building on my advantage 
and soon I lost the thread of the game.

This victory enabled me not only to win 
the tournament with a ‘plus five’ result and
increase my rating to 2820, but also to 
repeat my finishing spurt at Belfort 1988 (6 
out of 7, without draws) and establish an 
unusual record - 5 out of 5 against the 
players occupying 2nd-6th places!
Linares 1997 was an important landmark 
in my chess career: I was able to demon­
strate my superiority over the stars of the 
young wave. In an interview soon after­
wards I said:
‘For the first time in many years I have bro­
ken away from the main elite group in terms 
of my contribution to chess. After Las Palmas I 
already had the feeling that with the opening 
and general chess preparation accumulated 
over a year I could make a new surge. Now 
the collection of ideas has become so great 
that I have moved ahead in many directions. 
And here this showed itself! This was how it 
was in the late 1980s, when between me and 
the rest of the elite there was a gulf in the 
understanding of chess, and in work. But this 
disappeared in the early 1990s, when I did 
little work on chess.
‘In order to restore this lead, I needed a 
year of work. Yuri Dokhoian, Alexander 
Shakrov and myself - this is our small but 
united team, plus three computers. From 
sometime early in 1995 we built up a new 
chess base, and in Las Palmas I knew that it 
was ready. At that time I was not yet able to 
play at full strength, but the regeneration 
was in progress. And in Linares it occurred!'
To the question, who is now the No.2 
player in the world - Anand, Kramnik or 
Topalov - I replied: ‘To all appearances, 
Kramnik, although on sum of successes any 
of the three could claim to be considered 
No.2. But this does not mean that each of 
them would be able to win a match against 
Karpov, because match play is a quite differ­
ent matter.’
I also touched on the forthcoming match
192

Second Peak
with Karpov: ‘Here everything rests on my 
own moral obligations: I think that the world 
champion should defend his title every two 
years. Who should I now play against? For the 
public today I simply have no other opponent 
than Karpov: after all, he is the FIDE world 
champion, having won a certain parallel 
cycle. But now, after missing Linares, he is 
simply obliged to win the very strong tour­
nament in Dos Hermanas...’
However the Dos Hermanas tournament 
in April 1997 produced a different outcome: 
1-2. Anand and Kramnik - 6 out of 9; 3-5. 
Salov, Karpov and Topalov - 5, etc. It is note­
worthy that after Karpov lost to Kramnik in 
the third round, I received from Las Palmas a 
completely new proposal - to play a match 
with the winner of a match-toumament of 
four or six leading grandmasters!
Of course, I supported this idea: who 
would dispute the legitimacy of such a chal­
lenger? And at the end of Dos Hermanas, 
senor Rentero, the ‘father’ of Linares, also 
made a suggestion: instead of the usual 
tournament, the following year he proposed 
staging a four-cycle match-toumament of 
the four leading grandmasters in the world, 
and he named me, Kramnik, Anand and 
Topalov, i.e. the top four on rating.
Nevertheless, the hope of organizing a 
match of the ‘two Ks’ remained until mid­
summer.
Quality Control of the Champion
Double-Round Super-Tournament in Nov­
gorod (10-23 June 1997): l. Kasparov -  6V2 
out of 10; 2. Kramnik - 6; 3. Short - 5; 4. 
Bareev - 4V2; 5-6. Topalov and Gelfand - 4.
The Novgorod ‘tournament of six’, which 
reached category 20, a record for Russia, 
provoked a particular stir, since before it I 
suffered an absurd and highly painful defeat
in my second match with the computer Deep 
Blue - 2V2SV2 (New York, 3-11 May 1997). 
The colossus was shaken! And no wonder: 
throughout the spring I had been engaged 
not in chess, but in politics - I was helping 
general Alexander Lebed; we even created 
the ‘Third Force' coalition...
Yuri Vasiliev: 'As one well-known grand­
master joked, the match with Deep Blue 
slightly spoiled the champion’s brand. The 
sporting world is so arranged, that previous 
successes, even the most prestigious, are 
instantly forgotten, if you stumble even only 
once. A 'document verification’ of the world 
champion was expected, or more precisely - a 
verification of his ‘human face’: had not his 
creative face been changed beyond recogni­
tion by the skirmish with the monstrous force 
from the other world? Was this the same 
person as in Las Palmas and Linares?
‘Whereas in New York, Kasparov was tested 
by Deep Blue, in Novgorod the challengers 
were intending to arrange a quality control 
of the champion. Would he pass it? Garry did. 
Descending on to the stage of the ‘Lord 
Novgorod the Great’ from the unearthly, 
dizzying heights of the battle with the elec­
tronic monster (there it was a completely 
different nervous tension and a completely 
different game), the champion as though 
infected his opponents with some kind of 
unknown virus: it is probable that none of the 
participants will remember such a parade of 
mistakes and crazy oversights! Initially the 
number of decisive games was simply fright­
ening! White was rampant: after the first 
cycle he was leading lO-ll’
Again, as four months earlier in Linares, 
my main rival was Vladimir Kramnik. At the 
start he suffocated his contemporary Topa­
lov in the style of the young Karpov, while I 
won an instructive game against Boris 
Gelfand.

21...SC7 (21...£ld3 22 JLfl!) 22 Uta!
It suddenly transpires that White’s attack 
is very strong even without f2-f4: both a2-a3 
and £sg4 are threatened. It is hard to offer 
Black any good advice.
22.. .1C3
A desperate exchange sacrifice - if only to 
get rid of the d4-bishop. After the ‘normal’

practically: he securely blocks the passed 03-

Black’s counterplay evaporates. The win for 
White is merely a question of time.

In the second round I drew as Black with 
Topalov, although I played the Najdorf 
successfully and could have fought for a win 
(cf. Game No.67 in Part II of Garry Kasparov 
on Garry Kasparov, note to White’s 8th 
move). Then with White I won two French 
Defences: with adventures against Bareev 
(in an endgame with two rooks against rook 
and knight), and quite easily against Short 
(cf. Game No.86 in Part II of Garry Kasparov 
on Garry Kasparov, note to Black’s 6th move).
After starting with 3V2 out of 4, I was in 
an optimistic mood. Kramnik had half a 
point less, and the remaining contestants 
were on a minus score. But a tense King's 
Indian duel between the leaders in the fifth 
round ended in defeat for me, despite an 
extra hour on the clock and an apparently 
dangerous initiative for a pawn. I was so 
distressed that I decided not to employ the 
King’s Indian again, although objectively the
197

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
opening was not to blame.
Thus after the first cycle I found myself in 
the role of pursuer: Kramnik - 4 out of 5; 
Kasparov - 3V2. Fortunately, at the start of 
the second cycle I was again able to beat 
Boris Gelfand in quite a good game.

This win enabled me to catch Kramnik, 
who drew with Topalov. We now had 4V2 out 
of 6, with the third-placed Topalov on 3.
However, the remainder of the tourna­
ment brought me a mass of disappoint­
ments. With White I was unable to beat 
Topalov, and with Black, after overstepping 
the mark, I only just gained a draw with 
Bareev. But the main unpleasantness oc­
curred in the ninth, penultimate round, 
before which I unexpectedly became the sole
201

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
leader, since the day before Kramnik had lost 
to Short.
Playing White against Vladimir Kramnik, I 
was eager to gain revenge for my loss in the 
first cycle, in order to win the tournament by 
a convincing margin and at the same time 
again move ahead in the score of our ‘classi­
cal’ games (which at that time was +3-3=7). 
After l  e4 c5 we played a variation of the 
Rauzer Attack, known from the game Shirov- 
Kramnik (Linares 1997), and after employing 
a powerful novelty (18 c3! and 19 Ji.c2!) I 
gained an enormous lead on the clock and a 
completely winning position. But then I did 
something terrible.

Suddenly White has been left without an 
attack, and is a pawn down. However, in 
time-trouble Vladimir played inaccurately 
and a move after the time control, visibly 
tired, he agreed to a draw (Vi-V*), although 
he still had the better chances.

Second Peak
And so, in Novgorod 1997 Kramnik once 
again confirmed his reputation as a difficult 
opponent! In the last round he tried for 
seven hours to breach Gelfand’s defences, 
but on the 66th move he missed chances of 
winning. And I, after drawing with Short, 
nevertheless took sole first place and won 
my third ‘super’ in six months.
‘I do not have the right to play as badly as 
on this occasion in Novgorod’, I said after the 
tournament. 'There were only isolated 
episodes and two whole games where I 
played well. I under-performed. But even in 
the terrible state in which I was after the 
match with Deep Blue, all the same I am 
superior to everyone else as regards store of 
ideas. Incidentally, I also played to my rating 
-2820!
‘I see missed opportunities and, what is 
important, I see my opponents’ play. A 
match with a computer gives a very distinct 
feeling: the absence of the right to make a 
mistake. My calculation of variations is now 
veTy good, and in long variations I did not 
make mistakes. My mistakes were elemen­
tary oversights. Simply some nervous de­
rangement due to a lack of mental 
strength... Now I will rest, hold my tradi­
tional training session by the sea - and with 
new strength I will aim for the 2850 mark!’
Meanwhile, having enlisted the support 
of the International Olympic Committee, 
FIDE was preparing for its first knock-out 
championship with 128 participants and the 
unprecedented prize fund of five million 
dollars. As tempting compensation for the 
wrecked unification match, llyumzhinov 
invited Karpov and me directly into the 
semi-finals! Just think: the two losers of the 
semi-final matches of four (!) games were 
each due $384,000, and the finalists in the 
match of six (!) games - $768,000 (to the 
loser) and $1.37 million (to the winner).
On returning from Novgorod to Moscow, 
on 27 June I sent the International Olympic 
Committee President, Juan Antonio Sama­
ranch, my official refusal to play in the FIDE 
knock-out championship: ‘The proposed 
formula breaks with tradition and, unfortu­
nately, devalues the title of world cham­
pion... I have already stated publicly, un- 
equivocably and unambigously, that under 
no circumstances will I take part in this 
event.’ Ilyumzhinov’s FIDE needed ten whole 
years to admit that the world title can be 
contested only in long matches!
During the Novgorod tournament I said 
that ‘the idea of the match with Karpov was 
not yet dead’, and I promised within a 
month to reply more precisely. But on 21 
July, a week after Dortmund 1997 (l. Kram­
nik - 6V2 out of 9; 2. Anand - 5V2; 3-4. Topa­
lov and Ivanchuk - 5; 5. J.Polgar - 4Vz; 6-8. 
Gelfand, Karpov and Short - 4), I was forced 
to declare: ‘The match with Karpov, unfor­
tunately, will not happen. I did not expect 
this and to the last moment I thought that 
everything was normal. Before the tourna­
ment in Dortmund, Karpov and I even 
rewrote our agreement... As never before in 
my life, I was rooting for Karpov, but his 
result had an adverse effect on our sponsors’ 
frame of mind.’

After completing a summer training ses­
sion in Croatia, where after staying on Red 
Island for four years we moved to the de­
lightful seaside town of Makarska, I flew to
203

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
distant Buenos Aires and on 6-7 September I 
gave a double-round clock simultaneous 
against the Argentinian team (8V2-3V2). And 
at the end of September Dohoian and I set 
off to the Dutch town of Tilburg, where I had 
not been for six years.
Yuri Vasiliev: 'Before the start of the tradi­
tional tournament in Tilburg everyone was 
asking: who will win this time - Kasparov or 
Kramnik? Before this Garry had finished 
ahead of Vladimir in the spring in Linares, 
and in the summer in Novgorod. What would 
happen in the autumn? Kasparov was in the 
unaccustomed role of tournament veteran - 
as the organisers repeated several times, he 
was invited in the role of 'professor', setting 
examinations (autumn term?) for the tal­
ented young players.’
Sergey Makarychev: ‘This Tilburg looked 
rather more modest than the hugely strong 
super-toumaments of recent times, but it had 
an intriguing aspect: the 34-year-old ‘vet­
eran’ Garry Kasparov was testing the young. 
True, two of these young players - Vladimir 
Kramnik and Peter Svidler - are already so 
strong, that they themselves are capable of 
testing anyone. Together with Kasparov they 
comprised a truly Herculean trio, scoring 50% 
of all the wins in the tournament!’
For me this tournament proved difficult 
not even due to its youthful nature, but 
rather because of the uneven line-up. Thus 
the world junior champion, the American Tal 
Shaked (who was admitted instead of Topa­
lov) suffered eight defeats with three draws. 
After easily beating him in the first round, 
Kramnik joked: 'For me the expression 'to 
play in Tal style' has taken on a new mean­
ing.’ It was clear that in Tilburg the player to 
succeed would be the one of the favourites 
who dealt most severely with the outsiders.
The start went very well - 3 out of 3! With 
Black I struck van Wely’s position a decisive
blow as early as the 15th move, and with 
White I confidently outplayed Judit Polgar. 
As her second Lev Psakhis admitted, ‘when 
you are preparing for the ‘white’ Kasparov, 
you want to metamorphose into a tiny little 
insect, as in Franz Kafka’s novel, and hide 
somewhere far away...’ Then in 20 moves I 
disposed of Shaked, after employing a 
valuable novelty in a Grunfeld (cf. Game 
N0.16 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988-2009, 
note to White’s 8th move). I decided to 
return to this ‘well-forgotten’ defence after 
Novgorod, having become disillusioned with 
the King's Indian, and at a summer training 
session I began analyzing the topical varia­
tions with my trainers.
In the fourth round I had a complicated 
game against the young Ukrainian (later - 
American) Onischuk. I obtained a favourable 
bishop endgame, but I missed some winning 
chances and Black saved himself. All my 
rivals also drew, so that the status quo was 
maintained: Kasparov - 3'/i out of 4; Kram­
nik - 3; Svidler, Adams and Leko - 21/2.
After a free day came the fifth round, in 
which I had Black against Alexey Shirov. We 
always had uncompromising duels, most 
often in the Sicilian Najdorf. And on this 
occasion too we played a game which, 
although by no means error-free, was very 
interesting.

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
Trying to create an attack on the light 
squares, but this proves to be illusory. 17 
jLh3? a4 18 <£)cl fia5l is bad for White 
(Lanka-Piesina, Vilnius Zonal 1993), and 17 
JLc4

17-..a4 also does not impress.
17.. .0.0! 18 <£id2
Shirov follows the planned course, not 
rushing with 18 g5?l, after which there is
18.. .^h5 19 gxh6 g61, when White’s attack 
comes to a standstill, and the black knight 
invades on f4.

After 19 Ah3 (Luther-Womacka, Schoneck 
1996) 19...b3l? 20 cxb3 axb3 21 a3 Sa4 Black 
also has somewhat the better chances, but 
this was the lesser evil for White.
19...Sfc8!
An important novelty! Weaker is 19...^xe4?l 
20 #xe4 (Dueball-van Arkel, Holland 1997), 
since in this case there is an immediate threat 
of Ad3, and if 20...a3 21 b3 #c5, then 22 ±c4.
After 19...Sfc8 it suddenly transpires that 
my counter-threats are far more effective. 
‘Apparently I did something wrong, since 
Black so easily achieved a good game’ (Shi­
rov). And, indeed, after this game the move 
order 12 h4 and 13 ‘A’b l was rejected.
20 <£)xf6+?
This stubborn striving to set up a #64 and
itd3 battery leads to disaster. 20 g5 was 
essential, although even here after 20...<£)h5!

(21 gxh6?! £sf4!) 21...#c7 22 Sh2 b3l 23 cxb3

At this point my opponent again stopped 
to think: ...b4-b3, ...a4-a3 and ...e5-e4 are all 
now threatened. A classic attack with oppo­
site-coloured bishops!

Nothing good for White is promised by 21

was more resilient, in the hope of 22...hxg5? 
23 hxg5 ixg5 24 ih 3  Sc7 25 id7! and ic6. 
However, here the bishop sacrifice is good -
22.. .a3! 23 gxf6 (23 f4? b3!! 24 cxb3 axb2 and 
wins) 23...axb2 (threatening ...b4-b3 or 
...Bxa2), and 24 id 3  gxf6 is fatal for White 
(cf. note to 22...4T8). Therefore White must 
return the piece, but after 24 ic 4  lxc4 25

A vexing delay. As after 22 g5, the pretty 
bishop sacrifice would have been decisive -
22...a3! 23 g5 axb2! (of course, not 23...hxg5?? 
24 hxg5 ixg5 25 Sh8+!) 24 gxf6 gxf6, and 
White has no defence: 25 4xb2 b3! or 25 f4 
Bxa2!, while the endgame after 25 Hh(d)gl+ 
4f8 26 #04 lxc4 27 ixc4 Sxc4 is clear
without any commentary.

Not noticing 25 f4l? ixf4 26 Bdfl with 
the threat of Sxf4, when White’s initiative 
fully compensates for the two pawns: 26...g5

25...ih 6
My Informator suggestion 25...if6(?) 26

Black has full compensation for the queen 
- rook, bishop and pawn, and all his pieces 
are excellently coordinated, but the possi­
bilities of strengthening the position are 
only slight, and if White does not make any 
serious mistakes he should reach the draw­
ing haven without particular difficulty.

The following day I crushed the young 
Leko in a Scotch Game and reached ‘plus 
five’. This is how the leading trio looked at 
that moment: Kasparov - 5V2 out of 6; 
Kramnik and SvidleT - AVi.
Then I had Black against the 21-year-old 
St. Peterburg player PeteT SvidleT, who was 
gaining in strength and by that time had 
already won the Russian Championship
three times. Together we had won two 
Olympiads (1994 and 1996), but this was the 
fiTst time we met in an individual tourna­
ment. Alas, the first attempt proved a disas­
ter...
Yuri Vasiliev: ‘Peter created the greatest 
sensation of the tournament: he won against 
Kasparov! He deceived the professor - under 
the guise of a frog he brought a rattlesnake to 
the examination... The variation he chose was 
modest, but venomous. He appeared to lose a 
mass of tempi in the opening, and then he 
sacrificed a pawn. Garry too openly displayed 
a lack of respect for the audacious student, 
and he failed to sense the moment of real 
danger. He continued seeking winning chan­
ces in a position where he should have beat a 
retreat.’
Now Svidler was sharing the lead with 
me, with Kramnik just half a point behind. 
This badly conducted game upset and 
unsettled me. HoweveT, to still be in conten­
tion foT fiTst place I had to win in the eighth 
round against Jeroen Piket.
Dokhoian: ‘Every player knows how diffi­
cult it can be to play on the day after a 
defeat. In such a situation very few are able 
to demonstrate their best play. I remember 
how in Linares 1997 many were surprised 
when Kasparov, after losing the previous day 
to Ivanchuk, then won in good style against 
Judit Polgar and subsequently continued to 
demonstrate excellent play. Psychological 
resistance to a temporary setback is an 
integral condition for overall success. ’

Since Svidler could only gain a hard-won 
half-point against Adams, I again became 
the sole leader - 6V2 out of 8! But then with 
Black I only just made a draw with Adams, 
and with White I was again unable to beat 
Kramnik (cf. Game No.90, note to Black’s 7th 
move). Fortunately, my rivals also did not 
greatly accelerate.
These were the leading positions before 
the last round: Kasparov - 7V2 out of 10; 
Svidler and Kramnik - 7. At the finish Kram­
nik fully expectedly won against van Wely 
with White, Svidler unexpectedly easily beat 
Onischuk with Black, and with Black in an
English Opening I did not achieve anything 
against Joel Lautier. But here something 
extraordinary occurred.
Makarychev: ‘The champion, after losing 
his big aim (to improve his rating by scoring 
9-10 points), played out the tournament 
obviously without any great enthusiasm and 
at the very last moment he missed a unique 
opportunity to take sole first place.’

J.Lautier-G.Kasparov
Tilburg,
11th Round, 09.10.1997
In this equal position White has a good 
dozen moves leading to a draw. Therefore, 
when Joel played 20 Sc7? and offered a 
draw, I agreed - without looking at the 
board! But this was a mistake: after 20...Sb8 
21 2xc6 fixb4 22 Sc2 Sxe4 or 20...C5!? 21 b5 
(21 bxc5? 2b8! and wins) 21...Sb8 and

up and with winning chances.
Well, I was evidently not destined to win 
this tournament on my own: with Kramnik 
and Svidler I shared lst-3rd places. Here tie- 
break scores were not counted, but they
213

would have been best for Svidler. At that time 
Peter was playing very freshly and resource­
fully - and was steadily rising. His finest hour 
could have been the FIDE knock-out champi­
onship in that December, but in the quarter­
final he suffered a very painful defeat against 
Adams. After this Svidler somehow drooped, 
and although he continued to post good 
results, he didn’t quite reach the leading roles 
on the world stage.
As for Karpov, after the collapse of our 
match the only thing left for him was to 
defend his title of FIDE champion. Especially 
since at the end of the year he received from 
FIDE another fantastic ‘present’: with 128 
participants, in view of my non-participation, 
he was allowed directly into the super-final! 
And this despite the protests of many well- 
known grandmasters - Kramnik even refused 
to take part.
The main part of the first FIDE world 
championship on the knock-out system took 
place from 9-30 December 1997 in Groningen 
and produced a deserved triumph for Vishy 
Anand, who in mini-matches defeated Niko- 
lic, Khalifman, Almasi, Shirov, Gelfand and 
Adams. And already on 1 January 1998 - just 
imagine! - in Lausanne his super-final match 
began with Karpov, who had flown in there 
from the Canary Islands.
And so the chess world witnessed FIDE’s 
unprecedented ‘Lausanne experiment’ - a 
battle between the freshly rested 46-year-old 
Karpov and the 28-year-old Anand, worn out 
by three weeks of play. Vishy drew on his last 
reserves and, by winning the sixth game, 
levelled the score: 3-3. But for the tie-break he 
no longer had any strength: Karpov won both 
rapid games and retained the title of FIDE 
champion, which, however, provoked a mixed 
reaction in the chess world.
‘A colossal and undeserved handicap!’, wrote 
the well-known trainer Mark Dvoretsky. ‘At
present, and this is not only my view, Anand is 
far stronger than Karpov and he would surely 
have been successful if the play had been on 
equal terms (with both players equally fresh or 
equally tired). Karpov has legally become world 
champion, but in the eyes of almost all chess 
players he effectively isn’t.’
This last statement was confirmed very 
quickly by the results of Wijk aan Zee, Janu­
ary 1998: 1-2. Kramnik and Anand - 8V2 out 
of 13; 3-5. Shirov, Timman and Adams - 7V2; 
6-10. Karpov, J.Polgar, Gelfand, Topalov and 
Piket - 6V2, etc. Nevertheless llyumzhinov 
declared: ‘The title 'world champion’ is 
registered legally and belongs to FIDE. The 
world champion is the player who has won 
the world championship, and it has been won 
by Karpov. Although there are players with a 
higher rating.’ I should remind you of the top 
of the rating list at that moment: Kasparov - 
2825, Kramnik - 2790, Anand - 2770, Ivan­
chuk and Topalov - 2740, Karpov - 2735.
Crisis Point
Double-Round Super-Tournament in Linares 
(21 February - 10 March 1998): 1. Anand - 
7V2 out of 12; 2. Shirov - 7; 3-4. Kasparov 
and Kramnik - 6V2; 5. Svidler - 5V2; 6. Ivan­
chuk - 5; 7. Topalov - 4.
After losing my opponent in a match for 
the world championship, I also lost my 
mental equilibrium. After a series of tour­
nament triumphs it suddenly became 
unclear what to do next. Through lack of 
funds the PCA had ceased to function back 
in 1997. But I was far more depressed by the 
fact that FIDE had dared to break an age-old 
tradition, by replacing matches with the 
lottery of the ‘tournament of a hundred’.
Many realised that the knock-out system 
was unsuitable for determining the strong­
est player in the world (after five such
214

Second Peak
championships this was also realised by 
FIDE), but the enormous prize fund, cleverly 
called a ‘distribution of monetary aid’, 
pushed all sensible arguments into the 
background. In the absence of an opponent 
and a qualifying cycle my title was as though 
hanging in mid-air, and I felt isolated.
But here after Lausanne Karpov still de­
clared himself the sole champion! When the 
Sport Express correspondent reminded him 
about the memorandum we had signed, 
where he had ‘acknowledged Kasparov to be 
the world champion, and himself to be FIDE 
world champion’, Karpov said: 'That memo­
randum was private... Kasparov was the world 
champion, but he lost his title when he refused 
to defend it. Today I am the world champion, 
and he is an impostor, even with his rating of 
2825. Well, so what? He does not play in the 
official FIDE championships. As soon as Fischer 
stopped playing in the FIDE system, he lost his 
title. The only difference between them is that 
Fischer has not played for 25 years, whereas 
with Kasparov it is only five.’
Soon, on 30 January 1998,1 replied to him 
in an interview in the same newspaper: 
‘Now, at the finish of Wijk aan Zee, it has 
finally become clear to everyone how Karpov 
is now playing... Some are now calling me an 
“impostor"? Well, it is time I played a match 
for the world championship. The question is 
how this match should be regarded: as a 
political or a chess event? If the former, I can 
again play against Karpov. But it is unlikely 
that money would be found for such a 
match: Karpov’s play is now too weak. And, 
secondly, I would like to regard a match for 
the crown as a chess event, not a political 
one. Therfore I will play against the strong­
est challenger. The circle of players from 
which he will be determined is very limited. 
Soon all will be revealed - wait for the start 
of the tournament in Linares.’
It appeared that I had managed to find a 
solution: on 21 February, at a press confer­
ence in Linares, Luis Rentero and I an­
nounced the creation of the WCC - the 
World Chess Council (headed by Rentero), 
aimed at arranging the playing of the world 
championship. In the first cycle, shortened 
because of present circumstances, the 
second and third players in the world - 
Vladimir Kramnik and Vishy Anand - were 
to be invited to play a challenger’s match of 
10 games early in the summer, with the 
winner to play me in a match of 18 games in 
the autumn (Rentero named the Andalucian 
government as its organiser and sponsor). In 
the event of one of the candidates declining, 
he would be replaced by the participant in 
the imminent ‘tournament of seven’ who 
made the best result.
Linares 1998 was the second super- 
toumament in history, after Las Palmas 
1996, of the highest, 2lst category. Unfortu­
nately, I did not prepare for it in the best 
way, but more importantly, I was quite 
unable to concentrate on the play. The 
uncertain situation with the matches, the 
constant problems and negotiations - all 
this preyed on my nerves (true, not only on 
mine). To cap it all, I immediately went down 
with flu and for a long time felt unwell, 
periodically running a high temperature.
Nevertheless, things began quite well. 
With Black in the first round I with difficulty 
repelled Svidler’s attack in a Scheveningen 
(cf. Game No.37, note to White’s 13th move) 
and at the end I even seized the initiative, 
but lacked the energy to develop it. I was 
free in the second round, and in the third I 
had White against Vishy Anand, who before 
this had won against Shirov and Svidler.
MakaTychev: ‘So, Anand was on 2 out of 2! 
It need hardly be said that Garry arrived for 
the game, aiming only for a win. For the flu-
215

suffering champion, the rest the previous day 
was most opportune. As the press wrote, Kas­
parov, even pale and unwell, with a high 
temperature and absolutely starving, was still 
the same Kasparov - a merciless lion!’

Absolute domination.
Both 3 5 -lrc3 36 £ixh6 and 35...1rg5 36 
#xg5 hxg5 37 h6! are also hopeless. Anand 
lost on time (l-O) - for only the second time 
in his entire preceding career!
Strangely enough, this was my only win in 
the tournament: after it I assumed the 
unaccustomed role of ‘drawing king’, all my 
remaining ten games concluding peacefully! 
And after this loss, which was also Vishy’s 
only one, for a long time he was unable to 
Tegain his composure and he lost the lead.
Three rounds before the finish, the lead­
ing trio looked like this: Shirov - 6V2 out of 
10; Anand and Kasparov - 5 out of 9. But 
then Shirov lost to Svidler, while Anand 
competently picked off the badly performing 
Ivanchuk and Topalov. Fighting draws in the 
last Tound games Kramnik-Anand and 
Shirov-Kasparov produced the final results:
Anand - ‘plus three’, Shimv - ‘plus two’, 
KTamnik and Kaspamv - ‘plus one’.
Kramnik’s second, gTandmasteT Sergey 
Dolmatov: ‘This was how the tournament 
went for Kasparov. Against him all the par­
ticipants played with particular accuracy. 
With Black they kept away from lines deeply 
studied by Garry and avoided dangerous 
positions. And with White they often did not 
even try to initiate a serious fight, but above 
all preferred safety. Therefore with Black 
Kasparov effectively did not have any win­
ning chances in even a single game.
'A typical example was the last round 
game with Shirov. Kasparov employed a 
novelty (cf. Game No.37, note to White’s 6th 
move - G.K.) and equalised - a normal 
occurrence. Playing White, Shirov avoided 
any risk and, guided by tournament consid­
erations, forced a draw... Previously Garry 
often won with Black thanks to his splendid 
opening preparation. But even then I thought 
that sooner or later the ‘Day cf Judgement’ 
would arrive. And here in Linares the oppo­
nents skilfully neutralised one of the impor­
tant components of Kasparov’s succcesses.’
HoweveT, the next year in Linares directly 
the opposite picture was observed. Therefore 
my comparative failure in March 1998 was 
by no means a ‘Day of Judgement’, but the 
consequence of my illness and a short-term 
creative crisis.
Signs of a Tetum to form were aheady 
seen in May, when in Sophia I white-washed 
Topalov in a rapidplay match (4-0), and in 
Tel Aviv I crushed the Israeli team in a dou­
ble-round clock simultaneous (7-l). But in 
the middle of June I slumped: in Leon in an 
‘advanced chess’ match with Topalov I won 
only 'on penalties’ (3-3; blitz: 2V2-1V2), and in 
a rapidplay tournament in Frankfurt I fin­
ished behind Kramnik and Anand... To 
escape from the crisis, intensive and con­
220

Second Peak
stant work was TequiTed, and in July my 
tTaineTs and I began this at a TegulaT train­
ing session in Croatia.
In the meantime Anand declined to take 
part in the WCC candidates match. Vishy 
had obligations to FIDE, and in addition he 
was enjoying life and was not burning with 
desire to play a difficult match with Kram­
nik, and, in the event of success - an even 
more difficult match with me. Thus Kram­
nik’s opponent became Shirov - the second 
prize-winneT at the super-toumament in 
Linares. Their match took place from 23 May 
to 4 June in the Spanish town of CazoTla and 
produced a sensational victory for Alexey 
ShiTov (SVi-SVi)-
Thus in the summer of 1998 I spent a 
month and a half intensively preparing for 
my next match for the world championship. I 
was helped by Dokhoian and Shakarov, and 
towards the end we were joined by Boris 
Gelfand (who, incidentally, then won the 
August tournament in Polanica ZdToj, ahead 
of Shirov, Ivanchuk and Karpov). By the 
autumn I had calmed down and become 
stronger physically, and I had significantly 
renewed my store of opening ideas.
But Rentero reneged on his obligations. 
Already in Cazoria he experienced obvious 
problems in paying the prizes: Kramnik 
received only a third of the promised sum, 
while Shirov, who was due part of the two 
million prize fund of the main match, was left 
altogether without a cent. My losses were 
also considerable. As it transpired, the WCC 
project collapsed due to the retirement of an 
important official in the Andalucian govern­
ment, on the support of whom Rentero was 
counting. An attempt to negotiate with the 
Catalonian government also achieved noth­
ing. AfteT this sad story I realised that global 
plans cannot be lowered to a municipal level!
Feeling a moral obligation to play the
match with Shirov, with the help of my 
manager Owen Williams I began seeking new 
sponsors. The task was complicated by the 
fact that my opponent had a terrible score 
against me (-7=6), was rated a hundred 
points loweT, and had also finished last at 
Dortmund in July 1998.
Nevertheless a serious offer arrived from 
Los Angeles to stage the match in November 
with a prize fund of one million dollars - 
$650,000 to the winner and $350,000 to the 
loser. This was far better than nothing. But 
Shirov initially stated that he would not play 
for less than $400,000 in the event of defeat, 
and then he demanded immediate bank 
guarantees. My lawyer worked flat out and 
quickly prepared a contract, and the organis­
ers agreed to transfer the money to a bank 
account in installments over a period of 30 
days. But Shirov obstinately said: ‘No!’ - and 
out match collapsed.
While hope still lingered I played a training 
match of six games with Jan Timman (Pra­
gue, 5-13 September 1998). The hall with 
seating foT 700 was full every day, and foT the 
last two games it was unable to accommo­
date all those interested. The final score 4-2 
was exactly the same as in our first match in 
1985. At the closing ceremony I commented: 
‘It would appear that since that time the 
relative strengths of the two players have not 
changed’. The organiser of the Prague match, 
the indefatigable former GMA President 
Bessel Kok, told me that he wanted to organ­
ise a match foT the world championship. 
However, not the duel with Shirov, but one in 
the future, aimed at 'changing the current 
abnormal situation, involving the possession 
of the champion's title'.
At the end of September Kok approached 
FIDE and me with a sensational offeT to stage 
a ‘1999 match for the world championship’ 
with a prize fund of three million dollars
221

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
between the ‘generally acknowledged world 
champion Garry Kasparov’ and the winner of 
the forthcoming FIDE knock-out champion­
ship, which would be renamed the ‘1999 
Candidates Tournament’. This offer appealed 
to me, but first I was nevertheless intending 
to play Shirov. Alas, it was no longer possible 
to find anyone willing to stage the match...
Thanks to Rentero I was left without any 
tournaments: the vacancies at Tilburg in 
October and Wijk aan Zee in January had 
already been filled. I was obliged to restrict 
myself to analytical work with my trainers 
and blitz games with grandmaster Sergey 
Shipov.
My only appearance at the end of the year 
was a colourful blitz match of 24 games with 
Vladimir Kramnik (Moscow, 27-28 November 
1998). At the start I took the lead - 3-1, but 
then I suddenly ‘floundered’ and in the end I 
equalised the score only with difficulty: 12- 
12! The match did not earn me any laurels in 
this confrontation with a difficult opponent: 
Kramnik once again ascertained that he 
could fight against me. But on the whole I 
was content, since I felt that I was gaining 
momentum.
In addition, a long-standing dream of mine 
had been realised: to see how interesting 
such a match could be for internet users. For 
the first time all the games were broadcast in 
real time throughout the world! I intended to 
make use of this experience in the work of my 
recently founded chess site ‘Kasparov Club’. 
At that time my interest in Russian politics 
had cooled and I was seriously carried away 
with promoting chess via the internet.

13. Yermolinsky - 4; 14. Reinderman - 3.
I played in Wijk aan Zee 1999 only by 
chance: the tournament line-up was already 
decided. The organisers turned down a 
suggestion by my manager to include me as 
a 15th participant, with a reduced appear­
ance fee. But, fortunately, at the last minute 
Short withdrew (his wife had given birth), 
and I took the free place.
Towards the end of the 20th century the 
traditional festivals in Northern Holland 
became an annual gathering of the world 
chess elite, although since the 1960s the 
likes of Botvinnik, Keres, Bronstein, Geller, 
Spassky, Korchnoi, Tal, Portisch and Po- 
lugaevsky had all played here. For many 
years the venue was in Beverwijk - a small 
town with a population of about 40,000, and 
from 1968 it was moved to its suburb Wijk 
aan Zee - a district with two or three thou­
sand inhabitants. The sponsor has invariably 
been the local steel works, the owner of 
which was the Hoogovens company, from 
2000 - Corns, and now Tata Steel.
Previously I had not played in Wijk aan 
Zee for two reasons. First, because of the 
tournament’s insufficiently high category (it 
rose during the 1990s). Second, although I 
was a hardened Olympiad fighter, the ‘big 
bazaar’ atmosphere seemed inconducive to 
creative play. It is hard to concentrate when 
in one enormous hall five tournaments are 
taking place simultaneously: A, B, C and 
mass opens. But gradually I became accus­
tomed to this gigantic ant-hill and in the 
press I even expressed my admiration: ‘In 
the hall there are 500 people - a grandiose 
spectacle! The spirit of chess amateurishness 
reigns. The Dutch manage this brilliantly.’
The key intrigue of the tournament was
2 2 2

Second Peak
said to be my first meeting in 11 months 
with Vishy Anand, who in the previous year 
had gained a series of brilliant victories and 
was regarded as ‘the main opponent of the 
13th world champion’. Of a thousand chess 
fans questioned on the Internet, almost 50% 
predicted first place for Anand, half less for 
me, and a further half less for Shirov and 
Kramnik.
Of course, before the start I experienced 
both tension and excitement, but even more
- a severe tournament hunger! I was in an 
excellent mood, since I felt I had a great 
reserve of strength and fresh ideas. Also 
reassuring was the No.l which I selected at 
the drawing of lots.
True, in the first round I had a quiet draw 
with Ivanchuk: Black gradually equalised in 
a ‘Karlsbad’. But in the second round I was 
able to crush the Sveshnikov Variation as 
performed by the 26-year-old Loek van Wely, 
who in the future was to win the Dutch 
Championship many times.

the weakness of the d5 point and the back­

his pieces.

A good start - l'/i out of 2, but Anand be­
gan with two wins.
The following day, 18 January, was free, 
and in the A group the organisers arranged 
a blitz tournament (only Shirov, who had to
see a dentist, was replaced by the local 
master Bosboom). Many were expecting 
Anand to win, but I started with 7 out of 7, 
and after a draw with Kramnik I again won - 
8V2 out of 9! And although I then contrived 
to lose with White to Bosboom, in the end I 
scored 101/2 out of 13 and took first place by 
a margin of one and a half points ahead of 
Anand and Ivanchuk, whom I beat in our 
individual games (from the year 2000, for 
some reason, such blitz tournaments were 
no longer held).
After such a powerful stimulus I felt very 
much on form. In the third round I beat 
Yermolinsky with Black, after castling queen- 
side in the Griinfeld - a very rare occurrence 
(cf. Game No.67, note to White’s 10th move), 
and I caught the leader - Anand. Topalov 
and Kramnik were half a point behind.
In the fourth round came an unforgetta­
ble duel with Veselin Topalov, the fantastic 
finish to which was published in all the 
world's chess magazines. Hans Ree: 'Those 
who were fortunate enough to be present at 
this game will talk about it to their children 
and grandchildren, and these stories will 
continue as long as chess is alive!’

preparing.

White’s only achievement is that he has

This rare combination was possibly the 
most brilliant in my chess career. During our 
evening walk Dokhoian and I met Yer- 
molinsky, and he proclaimed: Yes, / saw it on 
the monitor. Not bad!'. Moreover, the organ­
isers announced that this game could al­
ready be called the most brilliant in the
tournament, while the local correspondents 
christened it a ‘diamond’ and suggested that 
it would be the best game in 1999, even 
though the year had just begun. Later the 
experts deemed it to be the best in the 74th 
volume of Informator.
That day Anand also won, and we both 
reached 3V2 out of 4. In the fifth round I 
outplayed Reinderman in a tense battle and 
finally took the sole lead. Then I won a 
slightly better ending against Piket, who got 
into very severe time-trouble, and I in­
creased the gap: Kasparov - 5V2 out of 6; 
Anand - 4V2; Kramnik -  4.
The seventh round battle with the WCC 
challenger Alexey Shirov was ultra-crucial, in 
view of our wrecked match. Shirov blamed 
me, although in the episode involving the 
WCC I had suffered no less than him and in 
return I had ‘unearthed’ the match in Los 
Angeles, which was rejected by my oppo­
nent. And when Kok suggested I play a six- 
game match with Judit Polgar in the sum­
mer with a prize fund of $200,000,1 declined 
in favour of Alexey...
From the press: ‘The game created height­
ened interest with the exacting public, who 
crowded round the barrier separating the

recognised by the numerous journalists, the 
participants in the super-tournament, and 
above all by the players themselves: they were 
extremely tense and composed.’

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
<£)c3 a6 6 &e3 (6 f3 ^ 6  - Game No.76)
6...£}g4
A fully anticipated opening duel, al­
though there could also have followed 6...e5 
(Game Nos.45, 93) or 6...e6 7 f3 b5 (Game 
Nos.56, 58, 66, 74).
7 i.g5 h6 8 &h4 g5 9 &g3 &g7
In our preparations for the match with 
Shirov, my trainers and I looked a great deal 
at this position and devised some ideas.
10 £e2 (10 Wd2 - Game No.54; 10 h3 - 
Game No.63) 10...h5 11 -&-Xg4 hxg4
Instead of the customary H...iLxg4 (Game 
Nos.32, 40, 116), I conceived the idea of 
rehabilitating a rejected variation.
12 0-0
Soon 12 <£)d5 ^c6 13 ^f5 came to the 
fore: 13—&xf5 (13—&xb2 14 Sbl ,&a3 is also 
possible) 14 exf5 Jtxb2 15 Sbl ^aS-r 16 Wd2 
JLd4! 17 ®xa5 £ixa5 18 <£>c7+ &d7 19 <£>xa8 
Sxa8 with equality (Anand-Topalov, Dort­
mund 1999). 18 c3l ^.c5?l 19 £)c7+ &d7 20 
<£>xa8 Sxa8 21 h4 gxh3 (21...Sh8 22 h5) 22 
Sxh3 is stronger, with a favourable end­
game (Shirov-Grischuk, Wijk aan Zee 2011), 
but l8 —&f6! is more solid.
12...e6?!
A dubious novelty. White would also have 
been fully satisfied with l2..JLxd4?l 13 
WxdA f6 14 <£>d5 ^ c6 15 # e 3 (Shirov-Salov,
Wijk aan Zee 1998), 12...'Brb6?l 13 £if5 .&xf5 
14 ^d5l (Ramesh-Minasian, Ubeda 1999), 
and the most popular I2...£ic6(!) 13 ^f5 
^.xf5?! 14 exf5.
Soon in this last line I was indeed able to 
rehabilitate the variation: 13..JLxc3! 14 bxc3 
Was 15 1i rxg4 f6 (the black king is quite well 
placed on f7) 16 Sabi (16 Wt3 £)e5 17 'Sfe3 
.&xf5 18 exf5 Sc8 with equality, Leko-Lutz, 
Frankfurt (rapid) 1999) lB-’i'xcS 17 Sfdl 
£>e5 18 JLxeS #xe5 19 g3 b5, and White had 
to struggle for a draw (Shirov-Kasparov, 
Sarajevo 1999, 2nd round). In the sixth round 
Leko did not risk playing 6 JLe3 against me, 
explaining after the game: "because of the 
weakness of the doubled pawns on c2 and 
c3’. Later he nevertheless tried 15 <£)e3!? 
(instead of 15 1i rxg4) 15—&e6 16 Sbl and 
<£>d5 (Leko-Gelfand, Monte Carlo (rapid) 
2002). But Black can avoid this by 14—f6!? 15 
#xg4 WaS.
This was my main ‘secret weapon’, but on 
that January day I was tempted by.another 
idea, devised in the summer - on the beach. I 
wanted to deprive the white knights of the 
f5- and d5-squares. Although in doing so the 
d6-pawn is weakened or even sacrificed, and 
the ‘blunt’ bishop on g3 is activated, I was 
pinning my hopes on the ...<£)d7(c6)-e5 
manoeuvre. The plan with 12...e6 is ex­
tremely risky, but unexpected! Besides, at 
the time I did not see any refutation of it. 
Shirov, naturally, was surprised and he sank 
into thought- 
13 &d2?!
This obvious move was the one I expected. 
Black need not fear either 13 <£>de2 (Almasi- 
Kir.Georgiev, Bundesliga 1999) 1 3 -^6 ! 14 
i.xd6 b5 or 14 ®xd6 #xd6 15 JLxd6 <£>e5 
with good play, or 13 <£>b3 ^.xc3! 14 bxc3 e5 
with a secure shelter and chances of exploit­
ing the weakness of the white pawns (Tivia- 
kov-Vachier-Lagrave, Hoogeveen 2010).
232

Second Peak
However, 13 Sell could have emphasised 
Black’s retarded development: the gambit 
move I3...£)d7? is now bad because of 14 
iLxd6 £ie5 15 £sc(d)b5l or I4...ie5 15 £)f5l 
(Vallejo-Ortega, Saint Vincent 1999), and 
other moves are also insufficient: 13...0-0 14 
e5 or 14 # d 2l with an attack, or 13..Jte5 14 
iLxe5 dxe5 15 ^ 3  Wxdl 16 <£ixdl! with 
obviously the better ending.
13...£)d7!
The point of my idea: with his powerful 
knight on e5 Black has nothing to fear.
14 JLxd6?!
Of course, it was better to play 14 Sadi 
£ie5 (to me this position seemed acceptable 
for Black) 15 b3 with the intention of f2-f3, 
and if 15...b5, then 16 a4l. But Shirov decided 
to try and refute my audacious idea with the 
help of a knight sacrifice.
14...<£)e5 15 <£)cb5 axb5 16 <£)xb5 f6! (an 
important defensive move) 17 Sfdl
If 17 <£ic7+?! 4T7 18 <£ixa8 Black has the 
fork l 8...<£)c4 (which there would not have 
been after 13 Sell) 19 ^40^4) WxdB 20 
#xd6 <2^xd6 with two pieces for a rook and 
an excellent endgame (21 e5? <£)c4!). There­
fore Alexey preferred to remain with two or 
three pawns for the piece and chances of 
pursuing the exposed black king. Alas, the 
compensation proves to be insufficient.
17.. .4f7 18 #e2 (18 a4 £ic6!?) I8...1,d7
Not bad, but I 8...<£ic6!? was more interest­
ing, avoiding the spoiling of the pawns, for 
example: 19 itg3 ^ 6  or 19 JLc5 ^
8! 20 
1 ^ 4  &g6 21 #g3 IT17, etc.
19 M e S  (19 c4 &g6!) 19...fxe5 20 £)d6+ 
Shirov was already short of time, and it 
was increasingly difficult for him to find 
accurate moves. Later he recommended 20 
'Srxg4 with the idea of 20...#e7 21 <£)d6+, but
20.. .6g8(g6) is more shrewd.
20.. .6g6

White would have lost after 21 <£ixb7?

stronger than the Informator 23...Saf8) 24 
hxg3 fih6! (Makarychev) 25 ®g4 (defending 
against ...Sah8) 25...Se8 26 Sadi M b with 
the threats of ...Wxc2 and ...Heh8.
21 #xg4 was essential, for the moment 
avoiding the exchange of queens, although 
after 2l...#c7 all the trumps would have 
remained on Black’s side. After the exces­
sively aggressive rook move, for the first 
time in the game I had a long think.

...Sah8) 22 ®xg4
22 C4?l (22 £)xb7? ib5) 22...Sh7 23 ®xg4 
(23 Sadi Sxa2) 23...#f4 was even worse. The
233

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
pawn has to be taken, but now Black ex­
changes the queens.
22.. .#f4 23 h3 (23 Wxf4? exf4 and wins)
23.. .#xg4 24 hxg4
With his powerful knight on d6 Shirov is 
hoping to create something resembling a 
fortress, but objectively his position is close 
to lost.
24.. .1.C6
Preserving the pawn on b7. 24...Sh7l? also 
deserved consideration, with the idea of 25 
<£sxb7 itc6 26 <£sd8 jLxe4 27 Hd6 itf6 or 26 
<£id6 Sah8 27 Sh3 Sxh3 28 gxh3 Id8! 29 
£ ic4 itxe4, gradually converting the extra 
piece.
25 C4?!
A weakening, which makes things easier 
for me. After 25 f3 Jlf6 the dark-squared 
bishop would have quickly come into play. 
25 a3! and Sadi was more resilient.
25.. .5hd8 26 f3 Af8 27 c5 b6
This pawn should not have been ex­
changed. There was a simpler win by

1.XC5+ 29 &h2 Sxd3 30 <£ixe5+ ^f6 31 <£ixd3

28 b4 bxc5 29 bxc5 l a 5 30 Sc3 2b8
Here I began to have agonising problems 
over the conversion of my advantage.
30.. JLxd6!? 31 cxd6 Sxd6 suggested itself,
followed by the win of the a2-pawn and the 
game, but at the board I was not sure that 
with the light-squared bishop I would be 
able to destroy the enemy fortress: Black has 
no pawn breaks! And therefore I decided to 
keep the two bishops.

38..JLe7 or 38...22a5) 38—&e7
38..JLxd6l? 39 cxd6 Sd2 and ...2xd6 
would again have won, but I stuck firmly to 
my course.

(39...2d2l? and ...2aa2) 40 2b6 22a6 41

White’s set-up would also not have held 
after 412cbl 2xb6 42 2xb6 jLd7(a4), etc. 
4 l—ie8 ! 42 2 h l (42 £>xe8+ 2xe8 43 2b6

was hopeless) 42...iLg6 43 2b7 2c6
44 £>f5?!
A pretty move, but ineffective. After sur­
viving one scramble before the first time 
control, Shirov was again in time-trouble 
and he overlooked an opportunity to com­
plicate my task by 44 2h6!, nevertheless 
forcing the exchange on d6 - 44-^-xd6 45 
cxd6 2xd6.
True, analysis shows that in this endgame 
Black would also retain every chance of 
winning: 46 2b2 2ad8 47 2 h l 2d2 48 2hbl 
2xb2 49 2xb2 .&e8 (activating the bishop, in 
order to take aim at the g2-pawn and bring 
up the king) 50 4f2 .&a4 51 2a2 2d4l? 52 
2b2 Jic6 53 2b8 2d2+ (the Informator
53..~&xe4(?) 54 fxe4 2xe4 55 ^>g3 2f4 56
2f8+ &g7 is unclear in view of 57 2a8) 54

2b4 56 &e3 &e7 57 2d2 2c4 58 2a2 ^>d6 59 
2d2+ &C5 60 2d8 2c2 and wins.
This bears some distant resemblance to 
the ending of my game with Yusupov from 
Linares 1990 (Game No.66 in Part II of Garry 
Kasparov on Garry Kasparov).
44—&f8
44....&XC5!? 45 ® g 7  &f7 46 £>h5+ ^>g6 
would also have won. In any event, with the 
two bishops the path to the goal is much 
simpler.
45 2h8 (45 £>d6 2xc5) 45-exf5 46 gxf5 ±f7 
47 &g4 &g7 48 2h5 .&xc5 49 2xg5+ &f6 
0-1
‘A battle on a grand scale!’ (Makarychev).
By winning against Shirov I set a personal 
record - for the first time I overcame my 
‘curse of five wins’. Usually after them there 
followed either a loss, or bad play, but here - 
a sixth successive win! And after it came a 
seventh, against the future FIDE knock-out 
champion Kasimdzhanov (at that time no 
one yet had any suspicion of his grandeur: 
he had qualified for the main tournament 
from group B).
And so, this longest winning series, not 
counting the incidental first place in the 
blitz tournament, produced the best start in 
my career - 7'A out of 8 (my ‘tournament 
rating’ crossed the 3000 mark!). Anand was 
points behind, and Kramnik 2V2.
However, I was extremely tired and I felt 
that the storm clouds were gathering over 
me. The tension grew from game to game, 
and in the ninth round the thunder charges 
reached the absolute maximum. In my game 
with the ‘new Dutchman' Ivan Sokolov I 
suffered a temporary fogging of the mind, a 
kind of ‘short circuit’.

4.. .0-0 5 ^.d3 d5 6 £>f3 (and here Sokolov 
used to employ only 6 cxds exds 7 £ie2)
6.. .C5 7 0-0 £ic6
Earlier and later I replied 7...dxc4 or 
7-.cxd4 (Game No.69), but that day I was not 
very well prepared for the ‘modem varia­
tion’, and I followed the most usual path.
8 a3 i-xc3 9 bxc3 #c7
By playing this, Black allows 10 cxds, but 
on the other hand he avoids, for example, 
the line 9.dxc4 10 JLxc4 
7 11 ^.a2 (Game 
N0.41). In any event, White has the two 
bishops and a strong, mobile centre, while 
Black’s trumps are free piece development 
and dynamic play, capable of neutralizing 
the opponent’s offensive.
10#C2
If 10 cxds exd5 I had in mind 11 ^h4 'B'aS

10 Wc2, the move chosen by Sokolov, led 
to a position which was familiar to me from 
childhood. However, by the irony of fate, at 
the decisive moment I forgot the old analy­

be completely alright...

13.. .exd4! 14 cxd4 i-g4 15 e5
The start of a lengthy, forcing variation. 
Sokolov played this very confidently, although 
he was probably counting only on a draw.

The critical position, which has been 
known since the middle of the last century.
21...Sxh7?
A ‘reflex', purely automatic move. I only 
needed to stand up, drink some coffee, catch 
my breath - and I would certainly have 
remembered that 21...<i ’f8! had to be played. 
Shakarov and I looked at this move before the 
All-Union School Children's Spartakiad (Alma- 
Ata 1974). Alexander Ivanovich showed us, 
the members of the Azerbaijan team, an 
interesting game between two Soviet corre­
spondence players, which had been published 
in the Riga magazine Shakhmaty, and then 
before my eyes Tavadian on the 6th board 
defeated in this way the Leningrad player 
Egorov.
After 21...<i ’f8 the white queen is attacked, 
and although Black is temporarily a piece

holds this slightly inferior position. I found 
this defence later, but at the time I thought 
that with 21...‘&>f8 Black was winning.
Alas, instead of this a losing move was 
made. When after the game I was leaving 
the hall, Timman commented sarcastically:
‘Sometimes you have to check old analyses...’ 
I remember thinking at the time: analyses of 
the best Soviet trainers don’t need to be 
checked - they simply have to be reproduced 
on the board!

Black has no good defence against 2g6 and 
1Hrf4: if 26...Se8 or 26...'irf7 the prophylactic 
move 27 iLc3! is decisive - White safeguards 
the el-square against the invasion of the

picks up the f6-pawn.

A terrible rout! Although I was still lead­

point behind. Fortunately, the next round, in 
which we played each other, was after a free 
day, and I was able to rest a little and com­
pose myself. However, I did not achieve 
anything against the Queen’s Gambit Ac­
cepted (cf. Game No.57, note to White’s 11th 
move), and the result was a short draw.
In the 11th round I had Black against 
Timman, who had analysed my seventh 
round game with Shirov and had prepared a 
surprise - 13 Sell (cf. Game N0.51, note to 
White’s 13th move). But after 6 ,&e3 I devi­
ated - 6...e6 7 g4 h6, and then my opponent 
immediately forced a draw, by repeating the 
exact moves of my game with Shirov from 
Linares 1998 (cf. Game No.37, note to 
White’s 6th move). From the press: ‘Appar­
ently Timman derived great pleasure from 
this joke game, since later all evening he 
drank beer in the press centre and laughed 
about how he had fooled Kasparov.'
In the meantime Anand beat van Wely, 
and two rounds before the finish the situa­
tion became much sharper: Vishy was only 
half a point behind me, and I still had to play 
Svidler and Kramnik. In the 12th round 
Anand equalised with Black against Yer- 
molinsky - a draw on the 20th move. And I 
had White against Peter Svidler, who, I will 
remind you, in Tilburg 1997 inflicted on me 
my only defeat, thus depriving me of sole first 
place. It was time for the debt to be repaid.

(Portisch-AdoTjan, Amsterdam 1971; Karpov- 
Kamsky, 5th match game, Elista 1996).
An interesting nuance: before breaking 
open the kingside, White waits to see where 
the d7-knight will go. The dynamics of the 
position are such that he has to play very 
accurately - otherwise Black may seize the 
initiative.
11.. .6b6?l
Without hesitation Svidler moved the 
knight away from his king - which is what 
we were hoping for! Il...£sf6 is correct, after 
which there would have followed an attack 
from the other side: 12 a4 (12 jLe2 £sc6 is 
equal, Ivanchuk-Shirov, Polanica Zdroj 2000)

However, soon Black’s play was improved 
by 13...£sd5! 14 ii.c4 c6 (Piket-Shirov, Monte

Sooner or later Black must ‘pull out the

A very complicated and, most impor­

even rate it higher than the encounter with 
Topalov, where I played the opening indif­
ferently. With this win I practically assured 
myself of first place, by reaching 9V2 out of 
12 and increasing my lead over Anand to a 
full point.

Second Peak
The last round began in the morning, 
which was not very good for me, but even 
worse for my opponent, Kramnik, who in 
addition was suffering from flu. We contin­
ued our duel in the Meran, begun in our 
blitz match, and strictly in accordance with 
analysis I confidently secured a draw.
Meanwhile, in a stem fight Anand won 
with White against Topalov and ended up 
on ‘plus five’, without any losses! He played 
very creatively in the tournament and 
posted virtually the best result in his career - 
but he only finished second. I think that this 
demoralised Vishy before Linares.
After Wijk aan Zee there again began to 
be talk about organising a match between 
us. At the closing ceremony the tournament 
director stated: ‘We are proud that our 
tournament has opened the way to a genu­
ine match for the world championship.’ And 
the press wrote: ‘Now, when Kasparov and 
Anand have demonstrated such superiority, 
the idea of staging a world championship 
with the participation of one hundred players 
looks completely pointless.’
Not surprisingly, around that time Bessel 
Kok modified his plans. Earlier he had been 
proposing to stage a match between me and 
the winner of the forthcoming FIDE knock­
out championship. Now Kok decided to 
arrange in the autumn of 1999 a match 
simply between player No.l and player No.2.
My Stellar Linares
Double-Round Super-Tournament in Linares 
(20 February -10 March 1999): 1. Kasparov -  
101/2 out of 14; 2-3. Kramnik and Anand - 8; 
4. Leko - 6V2; 5-6. Topalov and Ivanchuk - 6; 
7-8. Svidler and Adams - 5V2.
Just three weeks after Wijk aan Zee my 
rivalry with Anand continued in Linares, 
which as usual assembled a brilliant, even
line-up. This category 20 super-tournament 
included all the previous year's ‘2700s’, apart 
from Shirov (who held a grudge against 
senor Rentero, although the latter was no 
longer involved, having been seriously 
injured in a car crash), plus Adams and the 
burgeoning 19-year-old Leko.
Two cycles, 14 rounds - by today’s stan­
dards, a marathon distance! Before the start 
I was planning to score ‘plus four’, which 
was the limit of my self-esteem: this should 
have sufficed for first place, for which I was 
hoping after Wijk aan Zee. And almost to the 
middle of the tournament everything fol­
lowed the planned schedule - nothing 
heralded the final super-result.
In the first round I had White against 
Svidler and I decided not play 1 d4 (as in 
Wijk aan Zee), but after 1 e41 did not achieve 
anything in a Ruy Lopez - a draw on the 
32nd move. But in the second round unex­
pectedly quickly I seized the initiative with 
Black in my game with Vassily Ivanchuk.

quickly winning the a- and b-pawns, but also 
retaining the rooks, although even in this 
case I would still have had to play accurately.
And here White unexpectedly resigned 
(O-l). Analysis shows that Black wins with­
out any particular problems in all variations, 
apart from one - 32 g4! S al 33 4>g2, for 
example:
1) 33-.Sxa2, allowing the exchange of 
rooks - 34 Sell ^.d4 35 Se2 Sxe2 36 &xe2 
i.xb3 with an extra pawn and good winning 
chances, but with a lengthy battle in pros­
pect;
2) 33--&C3 (preventing the manoeuvre 
Sel-e2) 34 a4 Sa2 35 &fi! (instead of the 
Informator 35 3fl(?) ,&d4 and wins) 35-^.d4 
36 £>e4 (36 £>d3?! h5! 37 h3 Sd2 38 £ e 2 
■&xb3) 36..JLd5, and although as before 
White’s lot is unenviable, he can still resist.
But Ivanchuk was apparently too ex­
hausted by the lengthy defence of a difficult, 
unaesthetic position, and he hurried to 
avoid any further torment.
This confident win with Black over a dan­
gerous opponent improved my frame of 
mind and encouraged me. In the next round 
I went along to my ‘white’ game with Vishy 
Anand with an enormous desire to build on 
my success.

analysed both ll..JLb6 12 £ixd4 ixd4 13

^xc5 0-0, producing a novelty - 14 #cl!? 
(although later it transpired that after

thought for nearly a whole hour... 9 * 1

another idea.
9...#d5 10 £sg5! 0-0-0
After quickly making this and the follow­
ing solid moves, Anand looked at me with 
unfeigned surprise, as if asking - what can 
White achieve?
11 lc 4  #d7!
Black has no reason to set out on a risky
voyage - ll-'S'xeS?! 12 £sxe6 fxe6 13 fiel 
#f6 14 £se4 #f8 (my Informator variation 
with an ‘unclear’ assessment), since after 15

gets into difficulties: I5~.d3 16 ie 3  £sd4 17 
lx d 4  lxd4 18 #d2, and White’s chances 
are better.
12 4^xe6fxe6
It appears that Black has no reason for 
concern: for the moment he retains his extra 
pawn, and his king feels comfortable. ‘Some­
thing extraordinary is demanded of White’ 
(Makarychev).

14lb3?!
It is hard to criticise such a natural move, 
but 14 ^.a3! (Ljubojevic) was better, with a 
fearfully strong attack. If I4...£sd3?, then 15 
Sbl! or 15 lb3! is decisive, or if 14-Ie7? ~

‘In Kasparov style!’ (Makarychev). It was

Draw agreed on White’s proposal (Vi-’/i): 
after 29-&C7 30 Sxd3 &c6 his advantage is 
purely symbolic.
It was a pity that the gradiose idea 13 b4 
did not produce a win, but I sensed that I was 
on a creative upsurge. Silvio Danialov: 'Every­
one had the very strong impression: both had 
demonstrated chess of the highest level! After 
the game Kasparov was very sullen and angry, 
and he left quickly. Vishy was beaming with 
delight, he was very happy!’
In the fourth round I had White against 
Kramnik and after l  d4 £if6 2 c4 e6 3 £>c3 
iLb4 4 Wc2 I was unable to breach the ultra­
solid set-up 4-d5 5 cxd5 Wxd5 - a draw as 
early as the 2lst move. But the next day with 
Black I defeated the leader, Adams, outplay­
ing him in a difficult, nervy battle in the 
Closed Variation of the Sicilian, and at last I 
was leading the race: Kasparov - 3Vi out of 
5; Svidler and Adams - 3; Anand, Kramnik 
and Topalov - 2yi.
In the sixth round Leko held out against 
me in a slightly inferior endgame. In addi­
tion, the chasing pair changed: Anand won 
against Svidler, and Kramnik against Adams.
At the finish of the first cycle I had Black 
against an aggressively inclined Veselin 
Topalov, who unusually had scored six 
draws. With this game, which took place 
after a free day, there began one of the most 
brilliant winning series in my career.

with an extTapawn (22..Me7?! 23 Sh3l).
Dokhoian and I had looked at this entire 
variation the previous summer, when we 
were preparing for the match with Shirov, 
and the ‘non-human’ queen move was 
suggested by the computer. At that time, 
beginning with the 1995 match with Anand 
(cf. Game No.19), such computer novelties 
were only just coming into practice. But 
when the analytical programs became 
stronger, another surprising move was 
found - 20...Sb8! with the unpleasant threat 
of ,.JLa8 and ..JLxb4, for example: 21 Sh3 
,&.a8 22 i.xc4 dxc4 23 £>e2 i.xb4 24 i.b6!

and White, a pawn down, is thinking only of 
a draw.
21 £ xc4?!
The experts, to a man, thought this ex­
change was necessary, but the computer 
quickly points out the veiled tactical re­
source 21 JLd2! £sxd2 (21...Sb8?! is now bad

‘Now the black rooks have no files on 
which to invade, and after 4b2-c3 the 
important c4-pawn may be hanging’ (Shi­
pov). In addition the bishop has strong 
points (on b6, c5 and d6) - as Botvinnik 
taught in such cases, ‘the bishop must be
defended by a pawn’. Nevertheless, White’s 
defences remain vulnerable.
29 2 e l
If 29 JLe3 (but not immediately 29 4b2?

Moving this pawn off a dark square and 
fixing White’s kingside pawns. But here also
29.. .4b7 30 &e3 2d7 was more flexible,

‘A serious strategic mistake, probably 
caused by Black’s time-trouble, and, as a 
consequence, by Veselin’s desire to begin 
playing for a win’ (Shipov). The opening of the 
g-file backfires on White, but the line given in 
Informator - 34 g6 Sh6 35 Sgl c3(!) 36 Sg3 
<4^5 37 Sxc3 Bxg6 38 3Sc5+ <4>e4 ‘with un­

the patient 34 fifl! was correct.

An error in reply. The immediate seizure 
of the g-file would have been decisive:

Sg5 <4^5 39 c3 ^ 6 !  and ...<4>b5-a4-b3.

My plan could have been forestalled by 37

37.. .5dd8 38 Ae7l. Now, however, White’s 
fortress is destroyed.
37—Shh7 (threatening...Shg7; 37...C31? 38

The alternatives were insufficient: 38 c3

‘To gain time on the clock. In a calm situa­
tion there could have followed 39...C3! 40 
<4>d3 Sc7 with the threat of ...Sc4’ (Shipov). 
Or 40...Sh7l? 41 JLf8 Sc7 and wins. This was 
far stronger than 39...‘4’c6(?l) 40 Sg6 Sde7, 
etc., which I gave in Informator.
40 Sg6?!
Avoiding 40 Af8 Shf7 41 ii-h6 c3l (cf. 
above). According to Shipov, ‘in the time 
scramble White could have played for the 
trap 40 Sg81? Sxh6?? 41 Sc8 with mate, but 
after the normal reply 40...Sb7l 41 Sc8 Shc7 
he is in trouble’. For example, 42 Sa8 Sxb4 
43 Sd8+ (43 Sxa6 Sd7!) 43...'4>c6 44 Sd6+ 
<4^)7 45 Sxe6 Sb2, and now 46 jLf8 Sc8! 47

(51 e6 Sc61).
40.. .5b7?!
This does not throw away the win, but
40.. .5h8! or 40...Sd8! would have been im­
mediately decisive, cutting off the bishop 
from the queenside and then beginning to 
mop up on that side of the board.

In the end I have nevertheless obtained 
the desired position.

‘This opens the d3- and b3-points for the

£.b8 Sxg5 45 fxg5 (45 hxg5 h4) 45...f4+ 46

on account of the sudden 47 b5! Sb7 48 J.d6 
Sxb5 49 g6L 46...Sb7 47 itd6 c3l is correct, 
putting White in zugzwang: both 48 ^ >xf4 
Sf7+ and 48 4f2 f3! are bad for him.
Here I caught my breath and stopped to 
think. It is clear that there is hardly anything 
that White can move (if Sxh5? there is 
always ...Sh7). This means that the king 
invasion ...,&,c6-b5-a4-b3 should be decisive.

also the thunderous 48...Sxd4l 49 cxd4 c3)
48.. .6b3 49
Topalov confidently ‘marks time’. At any 
event, at this point he looked unperturbed.
With a second time-trouble approaching I 
tried calculating various lines and nowhere 
could I see a clear win. From the press: ‘The 
monitor showed a close-up view of Garry’s 
face, distorted by the enormous tension. In 
his characteristic way the champion was 
constantly shaking his head and casting 
dark glances at his opponent. Then he would 
turn away from the board with revulsion 
and again begin shaking his head. And 
suddenly, one after another, there followed 
two staggering exchanges.’
49-Exg5!
In fact 49-Sxd4l! 50 Sxg7 (after 50 cxd4 
it is no longer necessary to capture on g5 -
50.. .5c7l is decisive) 50...&XC3, was simpler, 
when in view of the threat of ...,&,b2(b3) and 
...c4-c3 the rook endgame is hopeless for 
White. There was also a win by 49..'£>c2 50 
lil?e3 Sxg5! 51 fxg5, but here not the Infor- 
mator 51...f4+(?) 52 ^xf4 (52 <&>e4(?) Sf7 53

54 g6 c3 55 g7 c2 on account of 56 ^gsl! 
with a draw (instead of the simple-minded 
56 gS#? cl®+), but the waiting move
51.. .5d8l, when White is in zugzwang: 52 
4f3(f2) ^d3, 52 &e2 f4, or 52 £.b6 Sd3+ and

No one, including the two players, real­

although Shipov commented: ‘There was a 
much quicker win by 50...f4l 51 b5 (51 &f2?! 
Rxd4! - G.K.) 51-axb5 52 a6 b4 53 a7 2d8, 
but again time-trouble interfered.'
51 cxd4 c3 52 g6 c2 53 g7 c l#  54 g8#
In this queen endgame, which has arisen 
by force, White is a pawn up, but Black is the 
first to begin checking and he firmly holds 
the initiative. But is this sufficient for a win?
54.. .#c4+ 55 4e3
The correct move: my Informator recom­
mendation 55 4f3(?) #fl+ 56 4e3 (with the 
idea of 56...f4+? 57 4e4 f3 58 #g3l with a 
draw) is bad because of 56...#el+! 57 4f3 
#e4+ 58 4>f2 (58 4g3? f4+ - Shipov)
58.. .#xd4+, continuing to pick up pawns. 
55-&C3
After making a complicated by-passing 
manoeuvre, my king has imperceptibly 
‘crept in from behind’ and together with the 
queen has created threats to the enemy 
king. It is hard for White to find an accept­
able defence: his weak pawns prevent his 
own queen from giving checks. I did not yet 
see a mating construction, but I sensed that 
the end was close and I became nervous.
From the press: ‘At this point Garry did 
something strange. The hall froze in fright. 
Even the ironic press centre did not make its 
traditional remarks about the ‘Kasparov 
theatre’: the champion leaned back in his 
chair, then suddenly slapped himself on the 
head and disappeared behind the stage.’ But 
Veselin maintained his ice-cold calm...
56 #d 8?
A final mistake, which no one noticed! 
Stohl gave the ‘losing’ 56 b5(!) axb5 
(56...#xd4+ 57 4f3 #d5+ 58 4f2 axb5 59 
#c8+ and 60 a6! is no better) 57 a6 #xd4+
58 4f3(?) #d5+(?), ‘and Black takes on e5 
with check’. In fact after 59 4g3 #xe5+ 60 
4f2 White is saved by the passed a-pawn. 
However, 58...f4l is decisive. Therefore 58 
4e2! is correct, with the idea of 58...#xe5+
59 4>f2(fl) or 58...#c4+ 59 4el! #xh4+ 60 
4 fl #c4+ 61 4 e l #e4+ 62 4f2!.
Also, no win for Black is apparent after
57.. .b4 (instead of 57...#xd4+) 58 a7 #xd4+ 
59 4e2 #xa7 60 #xe6 b3 61 #c6+ *b4 62 
e6 b2 63 #d6+ with a stream of checks.
However, Topalov did not even think 
about the saving 56 b5, but for the moment 
he made a ‘solid’ queen move, his entire 
appearance demonstrating his belief in the 
firmness of White’s position.

6l...f4+! 0-1
It was only here that it dawned on Topa­
lov. His face changed and he slumped back 
in his chair: 62 ^xf4 ^d3 leads to a spec­
tacular mate in the middle of the board. ‘A 
fantastic raid by the black king!’ (Makary- 
chev).
This impressive win put me in an excel­
lent mood and left me confidently leading 
after the first cycle: Kasparov - 5 out of 7; 
Kramnik and Anand - 4.
In the next round, without any respite, I 
won quite well with Black against Svidler in 
a Sicilian with 4 #xd4. Four wins in eight 
games, and all with the black pieces - this 
had never happened to me before! The lead 
over my pursuers grew to one and a half 
points.
The following day I met Vassily Ivanchuk, 
who was Black for the third game in a row. 
This was a rare instance when in a double­
cycle tournament they did not change the 
order of the rounds at the end of the first 
cycle, to avoid such a situation: Ivanchuk 
said that he was prepared to play three 
games in a row with the same colour! And in
258

the seventh round he beat Svidler, but in the 
eighth he missed a win against Anand, 
which seriously upset him. But I, irrespective 
of my opponent’s mental state, very much 
wanted at last to open my account with the 
white pieces.

Ivanchuk’s usual tactics: now and then he 
employs not ‘his’ openings, but those which 
have recently occurred with his opponent, 
and where he has prepared some novelty. 
Therefore Vassily’s choice did not greatly 
surprise me.

After some thought I rejected 3 e4, as I

Crippling the black knights. White’s plan 
is to exchange all the heavy pieces: in the 
minor piece ending it will be more difficult 
for Black to defend his weak a5-pawn, and 
the role of the passed b5-pawn and the 
threat of £x:6 will be strengthened.

It would appear that here also 36...£>xc6 is

has the tactical trick 37-£>b4! 38 ®xb4 ®d6.

Ads Ad6 43 4f2 with an enduring advan­
tage (two bishops, the weak b4-pawn), which, 
however, may not be sufficient for a win.
But Ivanchuk was so demoralised that he 
did not notice 37-®b4l and he resigned 
( 1 - 0 ).
Yuri Razuvaev: ‘As in the first cycle, Vassily 
resigned without exploiting all his chances to 
the full. It has to be admitted that the rebirth 
of Kasparov’s style of ten years ago provokes 
in his opponents a feeling of doom.’
262

Second Peak
This was my last win in ‘classical’ play 
against Ivanchuk (four draws in 2001-2003 
led to this final score in our individual meet­
ings: +10-4=19). It is amusing that immedi­
ately after the game Vassily said to his second 
that now he had to prepare properly for his 
game with the ‘tournament leader’ Kramnik. 
‘But what about Kasparov?’, some bystanders 
asked in surprise. ‘Here Kasparov is playing 
hors concours!’, explained Ivanchuk, having in 
mind the leading positions: Kasparov - 7 out 
of 9; Kramnik - 5V2; Anand - 5.
Before the tenth round there was a free 
day. I had to play Vishy Anand, and we both 
prepared thoroughly for this critical encoun­
ter, which took place on the background of 
the discussions begun with Kok about our 
match for the world title in the autumn.
Yuri Vasiliev: ‘Vishy’s camp was reinforced 
by new volunteers: grandmaster San Segundo 
arrived, and together with Elizbar Ubilava 
they spent 15 hours studying a critical posi­
tion in a topical variation of the Sicilian. But 
Kasparov and Dokhoian were also looking at 
this precise variation...’
Sergey Shipov: ‘The key moment of the sec­
ond half of the tournament. Whoever finished 
first in the final table, the individual meeting 
of the two leading players in the world was of 
great psychological and even political impor­
tance. The world champion’s lead over his 
rivals was great, but if he had lost this game, 
even first place in the tournament would not 
have quelled the fashionable discussions about 
power sharing at the chess summit.'

None of your 6 ±e3 £sg4 (Game Nos.32, 
40, 51, 54, 63, 116) or 6...e5 (Game Nos.45,

12 £sa4l is correct (Game Nos.54, 74), but 
the ‘amoral’ retreat to bl, employed by 
Ivanchuk, Anand and Leko, also has some 
justification: the knight covers the king 
against an attack on the a-file, and White 
hopes to break through quickly on the 
kingside and in the centre.
12.. .d5!
A classic counter. 12...#a5?! (Anand-Gel- 
fand, Haifa (rapid) 1998) is weaker in view of 
13 Sgl! with the threat of g4-g5 (Stohl).

Also a typical Sicilian pawn sacrifice, 
which in the given position was first tested

earlier 13...^e5?! 14 g5 £sfd7 (Ivanchuk-van 
Wely, Wijk aan Zee 1996; Anand-Topalov,

I8...fic8!
Continuing to strengthen the position. It 
is an amazing picture: White’s extra pawn 
has no significance, but the domination of 
the black pieces may tell. Everything de­
pends on tactics: if White does not give mate 
after the breakthrough in the centre, his 
position will begin to collapse.
19 Sell
This suggests itself, and it is also the only 
move (19 Wh2? Ag7 or 19 f4? £>c3! is fatal). 
Here for the first time I thought for some 
five to ten minutes - merely with the aim of 
trying to convince Anand that I had not 
studied this variation veiy thoroughly.
19-#a5!!
A paradoxical and psychologically difficult 
move: after all, the queen has only just gone 
to b6, and most important - it looks terribly 
dangerous to leave the e6 point without 
defence! In the pre-computer era such 
moves were not even considered... However, 
after 19-.Ji.g7?!, 19...Sc4?! or 19...£>7f6 there 
could have followed 20 £sfs!, while if
19...£>c5 20 f4 Ag7, then not 21 £>f5? (Mas-

£sxe6! fxe6 22 i.xd5 AxdS 23 Wxd5 4*7 24 
Wf3! b3! 25 f5l, and analysis shows that 
White maintains the balance.
Instead of this Black threatens by ...Wxa2 
and ...£lc5 to create great problems for the 
white king. And Vishy again sank into 
thought. Usually imperturbable, on this 
occasion he became noticeably nervous and 
he was clearly unhappy with his position.
20 f4l?
‘The best defence for White is attack! It 
was hardly worth saving the pawn by 20 a3, 
a standard move with this placing of the 
queens’ (Shipov). And, indeed, then there 
could have followed either 20...Wb6 (given 
by me in Informator) 21 axb4 J.xb4 22 c3 
Acs 23 £>f5 (Stohl) 23..JLf8! or 21...£>xb4 22

This was played in accordance with our

playing for a win, 21...e5 deserved considera­
tion, since after 22 1^2 #c4 the capture on

move.

‘When attacking in the Sicilian, White of­

This deceptive, intoxicating feeling can let 
even the best players down, but it would 
seem impossible to overcome it. I can assure 
you: Vishy was confident of victory and he

away from a draw - 47 <£ic3 and <£ixa4. He 
serenely played 47 4^a7, thinking that all the 
same he would pick up the a4-pawn - and 
fell into the only trap!

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
Namely, 51 &xa4

the knight with a standard mate. 51 £}a7

ftb6+ 53 4>a5 £sc4+ 54 ^a4 iLd7 comes to 
the same thing. Therefore White resigned
(0-1).
Razuvaev: ‘The main game of the entire 
tournament. Recently Kasparov admitted 
that stored on his computer are 3,920 origi­
nal analyses, and he added: “My preparation 
is not from variation to variation, but con­
ceptual - significantly higher than with the 
others." Therefore it should not surprise us 
that by the 27th move Anand ended up in a 
lost position.’
It was not without reason that after this 
game Alexander Roshal gave his report on 
the round the heading ‘Engineer Garry’s 
hyperboloid’. For the first time in tourna­
ment play a complicated computer analysis 
worked out at home was demonstrated at 
such depth - l6...'Brb6, lg.-.WaS and 22.. Jk,g7 
(remember also 20...1Sre7 in the game with 
Topalov). Black’s risky plan ended in com­
plete triumph, but this could hardly have 
occurred in the pre-computer era. To a 
human such counterplay seems extremely 
dubious and dangerous, but impassive 
machine calculation enabled it to be estab­
lished that White’s attack was not deadly, 
and that Black’s threats were very real.
As a result I achieved a unique result, by 
scoring five successive wins with Black, and 
all in the Sicilian Defence, which Alekhine 
once called ‘a gangster shoot-out in a dark 
room’. From the press: ‘Never before has 
there been such an instance in a tournament 
of ‘2700s’ of someone winning all their 
games with Black!’
The position in the race was now: Kas­
parov - 8 out of 10; Kramnik - 6; Anand - 5. 
In Shipov’s opinion, ‘only in the llth  round 
did the wise Kramnik make the correct move 
against the champion - 1 d4l. The outcome 
was another Griinfeld (cf. Game N0.36 in 
Kasparov vs. Karpov 1986-87, note to Black’s 
15th move), and a forced draw with a cas­
cade of sacrifices, which effectively settled 
the question of the tournament winner.
A natural slump set in, and in the 12th 
round my ‘white’ game with Adams took a 
very difficult course. After my .poor 25th 
move I lost a pawn without any particular 
compensation. But Adams could not decide 
whether to be satisfied with a draw or fry to 
win. Because of this he got into time-trouble, 
became nervous (which rarely occurred with 
him), and somehow unexpectedly lost. My 
lead over Kramnik thus increased to V/2 
points.
There were two rounds remaining, and if I 
had scored 1V2 out of 2, I would have sur­
passed the performance (greater than 3000) 
of Karpov in Linares 1994. I had hardly any 
strength left to play, but nevertheless in the 
13th round I played a fighting Sicilian draw 
with Leko (cf. Game No.93, note to White’s 
9th move), and in the 14th I almost broke the 
resistance of Veselin Toplaov, although after 
1 
3 I did not have anything from the
opening and I gained the initiative only at 
the start of the second time control.

All the games, apart from ours, had al­

agonisingly overcoming my fatigue and my 
pacific mood.

regretted that I did not play 49 £)h5. It would 
appear that if 49...£>f5 there is any easy win 
by 501i fxb6, but after 50...'4f8! with the idea

However, there was a genuinely worthy

A painful blunder, leading to the loss of all 
the pawns! 50 Wa2l would have been deci­
sive after 50...hxg5 51 c5+ Wd5, and here not 
the Informator 52 Wxd5+(?1) cxd5 53 cxb6

ble) 55 fxg6 i.xg6 56 i.e6+ i.f7 57 i-f5 Wd6 
58 &h3 iLg6!
With a draw on the 69th move (’/i-’/i).
It was a pity to miss the win, but as it was 
I finished on ‘plus seven’ - 75% in a tourna­
ment where, in contrast to Wijk aan Zee, 
only the strongest were playing. My rating 
shot up, far beyond the 2800 mark. I was 
also inspired by the quality of the games. I 
think that this was my most stellar Linares. 
This is what I had to say immediately after­
wards:
‘By the middle of the tournament I had 
warmed up. And I made more moves than 
anyone, i.e. I fought to the last pawn! And 
yet here 1 am the oldest player. But in fight­
ing spirit and energy reserve I am superior to 
the young! The explanation for my wins
269

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
with Black is fairly simple: in recent times I 
have been exclusively reinforcing black 
openings. And the Najdorf Sicilian is a 
minefield, where you can only make one 
mistake. In my preparations for the match 
with Shirov I analysed this opening a great 
deal, because in it Shirov plays the sharpest 
lines. But the match did not take place, and 
my entire ‘black ammunition’ came into 
action in Linares and Wijk aan Zee!'
As the press wrote, the world champion’s 
winning margin provoked memories of 
Nimzowitsch’s words, which he once ex­
pressed about Alekhine: ‘He deals with us like 
inexperienced fledglings!’ However, it is 
important to note that the mini-match with 
Kramnik ended in a draw: Vladimir held his 
own even in my best tournaments!
Historic Rating
International Tournament in Sarajevo (16-26 
May 1999): 1. Kasparov - 7 out of 9; 2-3. 
Bareev and Shirov - 6; 4. Morozevich - S'A; 5. 
Adams - 5; 6. Leko - A'/r, 7. Topalov - 4; 8. 
Short - 3; 9.1.Sokolov - 2V2; 10. Timman - lV2.
The category 19 super-tournament in Sa­
rajevo was a difficult one for me for many 
reasons. Playing after triumphs such as Wijk 
aan Zee and Linares is a real test: everyone is 
expecting new resounding victories of you! 
But here it was also a short tournament with 
an uneven line-up. In addition, in Bosnia, 
where I had been in 1994 during the bomb­
ing, I had a whole army of fans, and such 
psychological pressure also cuts both ways.
In the absence of Anand and Kramnik my 
main rivals were Shirov, Bareev and the 
rapidly improving Morozevich. On this 
occasion there was no starting spurt. In the 
first round Bareev acted ultra-safely against 
the Griinfeld Defence - a draw on the 22nd 
move. In the second round I again had Black
and I obtained some advantage against 
Shirov (cf. Game N0.51, note to Black’s 12th 
move), but I was unable to squeeze out more 
than a draw.
Before the third round the leaders were 
Topalov - 2 out of 2; Morozevich and Shirov
- lV2. It was time to begin accelerating, 
seeing that against my next opponent - 
Nigel Short - things usually went well.

field) 22...^g6
To avoid mate, Black would like to move 
his rook from f8. However, the immediate
22.. .5fd8? did not work because of 23 Sg5+
23 Sg5!?
Before intensifying the pressure with this 
move, I convinced myself that the alternatives 
were ineffective: 23 h4 #xa2l (23...ixb5?l 24 
2cxb5l) 24£>c3 #a3 25 h5! (25 Sg5? 2fc8!! 26 
2xg6+ fxg6 27 '§rxg6+ 4f8 and Black wins)
25.. .#xc5 26 hxg6 fxg6 27 #xg6+ with per­
petual check, or 23 Sh5 Sfd8! 24^d6 ie 8  25 
e5 2xd6! 26 exd6 Sd8! (after the Informator
26.. .#d4 there is 27 #h7+ 4f8 28 2g5) 27 h4 
#d4 also with a probable draw.
23.. .#C2
This would appear to be the best defence, 
especially compared with 23...#xa2? 24 
£ sc3! #02 25 e5! i.c6 (25...#xc3 26 i.e4) 26

25 e5l JLc6 26 itxc6 (26 h4l? also wins)
26.. .bxc6 27 h4l #xc3 28 h5 and wins.
But 23..Jtxb5 deserved consideration: 24 
2bxb5 #d4l (rather more accurate than
24.. .#dl+ 25 4h2 #al! - Stohl), and now 25 
h4 #g7! 26 #xg7+ 4xg7 27 h5 2ac8 28 hxg6

2b4 2d4 28 2xd4 #xd4 29 h4 £>d7 and 25 
Sbe5 #al+! 26 £.fl #xe5 27 Ixe5 £>xe5 
lead to equal positions, as pointed out by 
Stohl.
274

Second Peak
24 ^aB
Here and on the next move I spent a long 
time looking for more promising possibili­
ties. Say, 24 Sb3, and after my Informator 
line 24...#dl+ 25 .&fl ^.xb5(?) there is the 
immediately decisive 26 2xg6+! fxg6 27 
#xg6+ ^>h8 28 2xb5, while if 25...Sac8? - 26 
g4! with the threat of 2h3. 25...#al! is 
better, with the idea of 26 e5 ^.xbs (Stohl), 
but 26 £ic7! creates problems for Black. 
However, after 24--£-xb5!? 25 2bxb5 #c3! 
(by analogy with 23..JLxb5) or 24...#xa2l? 
there appears to be no way for White to 
develop his initiative.
24.. .1U3
Again 24..#xa2? is bad: 25 e5 #e2 
(25...^.c6 26 Sb4!, while after 25...#xa3 26 
^.e4 or 25...Sfd8 26 2xg6+! the inclusion of 
the g2-bishop in the attack is decisive) 26 h4, 
etc. (Stohl). In Informator I also condemned 
24~.#c3!? because of 25 e5 (25 h4? #h8)
25.. .6C6 26 &xc6 bxc6 27 h4 #xa3(?) 28 h5 
# e 7  29 &g2! and 2 h l, winning, but after
27.. .^d7! with the threat of ...£idxe5 (Shipov) 
or 27...2ab8 28 h5 £ic4! White has no more 
than perpetual check.
25 h4
25 e5 would have been a blank shot after
25...2fc8 with the idea of ...#xa3-f8 (Stohl). 
At the end of the game I thought that 25
2b3l? would have won. Thus, in the event of
25.. .#dl+? 26 ^.fl Black is not helped by
26.. .2.c8 27 2xg6+!, 26...2ac8 27 g4H # d 4  28 
e5 2 c3 29 £ic2! #c5 30 ^.d3l, 26...&C6 27 
2 d 3  # a l  28 e5, or 26...#d 4 27 e5 i.c6 28 
&d3! # d 7  29 £ib5.
But after 25...#d4! White does not 
achieve anything: 26 e5 2ac8 (26..JLc6? 27 
JLxc6 bxc6 28 2f3! and wins) 27 iLfl! (27 h4 
Scl+ 28 &h2 .&c6! is equal) 27..Jtc6! 28 2d3 
#64! (not my earlier recommendation
28.. .#a4? because of 29 £>c2! #xc2 30 g4! or 
29 £sb5M #e4 30 f3 #04034) 31 Sd4l #c5 32 
^.d3, winning) 29 f3 #b4! - instead of the 
Informator 29-#a4? 30 2xg6+ fxg6 31 
#xg6+ ^>h8 32 #h6+ &g8 33 .&h3 and wins. 
Now this variation does not work because of 
33-..#el+!. And after 30 £ic2 #c5+ I would 
have had to force a draw.
Even so, 25 2b3 would have set Black 
more problems.
25.. .#xa3 26 h5l?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained! Strictly 
speaking, it was now time to curtail the game 
by 26 2xg6+.
26.. .#e7l 27 e5 (of course, not 27 hxg6? f6, 
when Black wins; White vacates the 64- 
square for his bishop) 27..~&e8!
Black would have lost ignominiously after 
27-.&C6? 28 JLxc6 bxc6 29 &g2! (threaten­
ing 2hl) 29...#d7 30 2b3!.
28 &e4!?
The balance would have been more safely 
maintained by 28 hxg6 fxg6 29 Ah3, for 
example: 29-.#h7 30 JLxe6+ .&f7 31 2xg6+ 
4>h8 32 ^.xf7 2xf7 33 #g5 or 29...2f3 30 
<4>g2l, when 30...2a3? (recommendedby Stohl 
instead of 30...2c3?! 31 2b4!) is weak in view 
of 31 2xg6+! ^.xg6 32 #xg6+ #g7 33 ^.xe6+ 
&f8 34 #f5+ &e7 35 2cl!, winning, but
30.. .2.5 or 30...2xf2+ 31 4 ^ 2  #c5+ 32 <&fl 
i.b5+ 33 2xb5 2f8+ leads to a draw.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
‘The subsequent events took place in severe 
time-trouble, in which, as is well known, the 
most important thing is to make sure your 
mistake is - the penultimate one!’ (Shipov).
30 hxg6?
30 
jLxg6! JLxg6 31 2 xg6+ 2 xg6 32 1Hrxg6+ 
was essential, when the open position of the 
black king would have given White every 
chance of a draw: 32...&h8 (32..Mg7 33 
#xe6+) 331^6+ ttTi7 34 # f6+ #g7 35 #xe6 
(Shipov), or 32...‘&f8 33 Sb3 'Hrf7 and here

Wg6 37 #e5+ 4^8 38 2h3! ^ 8  39 2h8+. 
‘But the point is that Kasparov was playing 
for a win!’ (Shipov).
30.. Mg7? (here I could have lost - 30...jLc6!)
31 #h7+! (Nigel overlooked this nuance)
31.. .6f8 32 Wh4?
Also an instinctive time-trouble move: 
White avoids the exchange of queens. ‘Garry 
(no doubt with a formidable appearance) so 
to speak pummels the opponent’s brains in 
the time scramble!' (Shipov).
Meanwhile, the balance would have been 
maintained by 32 JLxb7l? Sd8 33 ik.e4, 32 
Sa5l? (Stohl) 32...Sb8 33 2xa7 e5 34 i.xb7, or

32..JLxg6 is more natural, after which 33 
Sb4? £)d5l or 33 »g4? ^ 7  34 Sb3 Wh61 is 
bad for White (not the Informator 34...2g8? 
because of 35 2c3l with equality). However, 
the following lines are good enough for a 
draw: 33 a4 2c8 34 ^ 4  2c4 35 2xg6 2xg6
36 WxgB IfxgB 37 JLxg6 2xa4 38 f3 and 
JLe4, or 33 2b3 (it is this that 1 was planning)

& g8 36 2 x g 6  # x g 6  37 2 f4l and wins) 34 
2f3l? (34 # g 4  £>e7 35 2 x b 7  will also do)
34.. .2xf3 35 Sxg6 # al+  36 *g2 2f6! 37

#xb7+ &f6 41 i.xg6 Wfl-r 42 *h4 £>g2+ 43 
&g4 ^xg6 44 #64+ with perpetual check.
At the time no one noticed the move

JLxg6 ’ilxgB 35 2h8+ &g7 36 2xd8 #xbl+
37 *g2 H i 7 (Stohl) or 34 Sh8+ *e7 35 Sxd8 
&xd8 36 2dl+ &e8! 37 JLxb7 #e7 and wins. 
33 jLxb7 ^.xg6 34 -&e4 2d4 35 f3 is more 
resilient, but after 35-.e5 White’s attack 
comes to an end and he faces a difficult fight 
for a draw.

‘Despite the result, mention should be 
made of the boldness and coolness displayed 
by Short, who resolved to (and did!) go in for 
a grand battle with Kasparov. His reward 
was a winning position, but in time-trouble 
it was once again the stronger player who 
was lucky.’ (Shipov).
An uneven, but fascinating game. This 
was my last ‘classical’ win against Short - 
two draws in 2000 established the final 
score in our games: +21-2=27.
That same day Bareev crushed Topalov, 
Morozevich did the same to Shirov, and the 
leading group now looked like this: Moro- 
zevich - 2'A out of 3; Kasparov, Bareev, 
Topalov and Adams - 2. In the fourth round 
all the games were drawn (mine in a Griin- 
feld with Topalov), in the fifth I outplayed 
Ivan Sokolov in a very tense struggle, gaining 
revenge on him for Wijk aan Zee, and in the 
sixth I drew in a Najdorf with Leko.
Three rounds before the finish the out­
come of the tournament still looked com­
pletely unclear: Kasparov, Shirov, Bareev and 
Adams - 4 out of 6; Morozevich - 3'A- The 
time for decisive battles had arrived.
In the seventh round came my first ‘clas­
sical’ meeting with Alexander Morozevich. 
After achieving nothing with White from the 
opening, I gradually assumed the initiative 
and for a long time the game balanced 
between a win and a draw, but in the end I 
won the endgame. And, finally, I felt com­
pletely liberated - the next day I confidently
beat Timman in a Griinfeld, after sacrificing 
the exchange (cf. Game N0.19 in Kasparov vs. 
Karpov 1986-87, note to White’s 12th move).
This was the position of the leaders before 
the last round: Kasparov - 6 out of 8; Bareev 
and Shirov - s'A- Since at the finish my rivals 
were playing each other, in my game with 
Michael Adams a draw would have been 
quite satisfactory. But I wanted to conclude 
the tournament on a high note, for which I 
chose the newly-fashionable Scotch.

This novelty is an improvement which I

Informator 23...1Srf5(?!) 24 c5 £ib5 is weakeT

the piece with an attack) 24 #g3! f6 25 c5 
Sae8 26 ^ 3 +  ^h8 27 Sedl White would 
gain an enduring plus.
But after 22...Sfe8 the chances are almost 
equal, and it would appear that my opponent 
relaxed slightly prematurely. The pawn 
symmetry apparently heralds a quick draw,
but all the same the white bishop is stronger 
than the hanging black knight. Black’s posi­
tion is far more dangerous than it seems.

Now Adams’s position sharply deterio­
rates: his knight is unable to find a suitable 
post. A surprising metamorphosis in a 
‘simple’ open position: just now Black was 
afloat, and suddenly he quickly plunges to 
the bottom.

Thanks to this third successive win I in­
creased my lead over my pursuers, scored 
‘plus five’ and reached a new historic rating 
mark - 2851. Despite rating inflation, this 
record stood for 13 years (!), until at the end 
of 2012 it was broken by the phenomenal 
Norwegian Magnus Carlsen.
The tournament in Sarajevo was an un­
commonly fighting one (the number of
decisive games exceeded 50%!), but I didn’t 
display the same boldness as in Wijk aan Zee 
and Linares. Evgeny Bareev: ‘The participants 
had the feeling that Kasparov was playing at 
roughly 25% of his desire. When it was 
needed, he would develop additional mo­
mentum. Eye-witnesses reckon that his mood 
here was very different from that in Linares 
and Wijk aan Zee. There he was an angry, 
hungry wolf, whereas here the wolf was 
good-natured, as in a cartoon film. But even 
so the good-natured wolf devoured quite a 
number of sheep.’
A month later I took part in a four-cycle 
rapidplay match-toumament (Frankfurt am 
Main, 29 June - 2 July 1999), staged as part of 
a grandiose festival to mark the 75th anniver­
sary of the Frankfurt West Chess Club. As is 
now clear, this tournament with its proud 
title Siemens Giants was unique in its way: in 
it participated only the classical world cham­
pions - Karpov (12th), Kasparov (13th), Kram­
nik (14th) and Anand (15th). At the time the 
last two were still called ‘crown princes’.
The organisers did indeed regard this 
‘battle of the giants’ as the unofficial rapid- 
play world championship. The reference 
material published beforehand contained 
information about the relative scores of the 
participants in all forms of chess. I had the 
best overall percentage - 54, Kramnik was 
on 51, Anand - 47 (because of his poor score 
with me), and Karpov - also 47 (but he had a 
worse score against all three).
We played one cycle a day for four days, 
i.e. three games with a 25-minute time 
control each day. I went through the whole 
event undefeated; in the first cycle I unex­
pectedly easily beat Anand with Black (cf. 
Game No.42 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1986-87, 
note to Black’s 12th move), in the third cycle 
I defeated Kramnik (Game No.l2l), and in 
the fourth cycle - Karpov (Game No.45 in
280

Second Peak
Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988-2009). A win in all 
the mini-matches with a score of 2Vi-l'/i 
brought me overall success: 1. Kasparov -  
7'/i out of 12; 2-3. Anand and Kramnik - 6; 4 
Karpov - 4'/j. Of course, I was satisfied with 
the result, but 1 did not harbour any illusions 
regarding the quality of my play, and so I 
said: ‘This victory should not be put down as 
one of my main achievements of the year.’ 
Indeed, 1999 was one of the stellar years 
in my career: 1 won three major tourna­
ments in succession and a blitz tournament 
in Wijk aan Zee. The extreme tension of 
playing against the leading grandmasters in 
the world did not allow me to conduct all my 
games at an identically high level, but even 
while making mistakes I continued acting 
confidently and I did not lose my composure 
in unexpected and difficult situations. As a 
result, at the closing ceremony of the Frank­
furt 
Festival, 
its 
director 
Hans-Walter 
Schmitt remarked: ‘Kasparov has shown that 
he is world champion in all forms of chess - 
classical, blitz and rapid.’
In Frankfurt we all made mistakes. The 
reason was the enormous stress: they may 
have been ‘rapid’, but three games a day, 
and against such opponents! True, I was able 
to retain a big reserve of energy. The secret is 
simple. Usually my competitive year would 
begin in September, after a lengthy training 
session, and by the following summer 
fatigue would set in and a crisis would 
ensue (as, for example, in Novgorod 1997 or 
Frankfurt 1998). But the 1998/99 season 
began late for me - in January, and by the 
summer I was not yet empty in either the 
chess sense, or psychologically, or physically. 
That was the basis of my victory.
That same summer, on 21 June, there be­
gan a unique internet game ‘Kasparov 
against the world’, organised by the Micro­
soft Corporation. Yuri Dokhoian, Boris Al-
terman, the program Deep Junior and I had 
twelve hours per move, while our numerous 
opponents, taking into account discussion 
and voting, had 36 hours. And on 25 October 
1 won on the 62nd move, deep into a queen 
endgame (where Deep Junior was especially 
active). Over the 124 days of uncompromi­
sing struggle, the specially created site was 
visited by more than three million people 
from 75 of the world’s countries - unprece­
dented interest in a chess event!
I was convinced that the ‘worldwide web’ 
would open completely new opportunities 
for chess. And on the wave of the world 
boom in internet business, together with 
financial partners from Israel I set up the 
‘Kasparov Chess Online’ company, the core 
of which became the English language site 
KasparovChess.com, which greatly expanded 
the audience and content of the Russian 
language ‘Kasparov Club’.
In August of that memorable year a new 
FIDE champion emerged - the winner of the 
second knock-out championship Alexander 
Khalifman, but, alas, because of financial 
problems 
the 
Kasparov-Anand 
match 
planned for the autumn was postponed 
until the following year.
Necessary Demonstration
International Tournament in Wijk aan Zee 
(14-30 January 2000): l. Kasparov - 9Vi out 
of 13; 2-4. Kramnik, Anand and Leko - 8; 5. 
Morozevich - 7'/j; 6. Adams - 7; 7-8, Piket 
and Timman - 6V2; 9- Nikolic - 6; 10. Short - 
5’/2; 11-12. J.Polgar and Korchnoi - 5; 13- 
Lputian - 4’/2; 14. van Wely - 4.
Before the next festival in Wijk aan Zee 
the previous year’s tournament was re­
membered, where I scored seven successive 
wins, but in the end Anand finished just half 
a point behind. And many were interested
281

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
in whether there would be a new race 
between us - the probable opponents in a 
forthcoming match for the title. Immedi­
ately after the opening ceremony and the 
drawing of lots we held a joint press confer­
ence, at which we confirmed our readiness 
to play this postponed match in the autumn. 
In passing Vishy commented: '1999 was a 
good year for Kasparov, possibly the best in 
his career, but now Garry has to demonstrate 
everything anew. Therefore he is again under 
pressure.’
Naturally, I was anxious, and mainly be­
cause of my lengthy break in play, but I was 
burning with desire to repeat the previous 
year’s success.
The start went well, although it was very 
nervy. After playing well a prepared varia­
tion of the Griinfeld Defence against 
Korchnoi, I obtained a better endgame, but 
with my inaccurate 22nd move I lost the 
greater part of my advantage and in the 
ensuing time scramble the position almost 
reached a draw. Fortunately for me, the 
illustrious veteran went wrong and resigned 
on the 55th move. This was our last ‘classi­
cal’ meeting (overall score: +13-1=13).
In the second round I was again Black - 
against Piket and, after employing another 
novelty in the Griinfeld I nearly overstepped 
the mark in a complicated battle, but in the 
end it was a draw. In the third round I spec­
tacularly crushed van Wely in an English 
Attack (cf. Game No.56, note to Black’s 12th 
move), and in the fourth I had a difficult 
draw with Adams.
By that time the leading group had taken 
shape: Kasparov, Kramnik and Piket - 3 out 
of 4; Anand, Leko and Morozevich - 2y/i. In 
the fifth round I had White against the 22- 
year-old Muscovite Grandmaster Alexander 
Morozevich, who in this game tried a stun­
ning piece of opening preparation.

A novelty at high level! At the time I con­
sidered this audacious and energetic move 
to be dubious, but today it brings Black good 
results, and largely because of it White has 
been looking for other ways of combating 
the Slav Defence.

After some thought I managed to work 
out the resulting unfamiliar problems, and I 
rejected the obvious capture on e5:

12.. .gxf4 13 £>xf5 0-0-0 14 #C 2
A flexible move, retaining the option of 
queenside castling or <&fl, so that after the 
opening of the h-file the king’s rook will be 
in play. If 14 0-0 fxg3 15 hxg3, then 15-h5 is 
satisfactory (Kelecevic-Tukmakov, Winter­
thur 2003) or 1 5 - ^ 8  (Shirov-Morozevich, 
Monte Carlo (rapid) 2005).
14...£>g4?!
With this jaunty swoop Black as though 
acknowledges that he is now playing purely 
intuitively. It is probable that in his prepara­
tions Alexander studied 12 £>e3 and 14 # c 2 
less than other moves. Soon he produced an 
improvement - 14-£>c5 15 0-0 £>e6 and 
after 16 Sadi jLc5 17 £>e4 £b4 he equalised 
(Kramnik-Morozevich, Astana 2001; Bareev- 
Morozevich, Wijk aan Zee 2002). But 16 #e4l 
(Ponomariov-Gelfand, Plovdiv 2003) is more 
promising. Therefore instead of 15-£>e6 
Black began seeking counterplay with 
15-fxg3 16 hxg3 a5 17 Sfdl h5 18 Sxd8+ 
#xd8 19 Sdl #f6 (Ivanchuk-Gelfand, Sochi 
2005).
He has also tried both 14—2.b4?l 15 0-0! 
and 14...£>g6 15 0-0-0 (Gelfand-Morozevich, 
Sochi 2004) or 15 0-0 with the idea of an 
attack on the queenside (an example: Carl- 
sen-Wang Yue, Nanjing 2009). But probably 
the most topical nowadays is 14-fxg3 15 
hxg3 &b8 16 0-0-0 ji.b4 (Eljanov-Moroze- 
vich, Beer Sheva 2005; Giri-Aronian, Wijk aan

very unclear play, for example: 15 gxf4 (15

The essential transformation of one type

for a passive bishop, but I was inspired by 
the model game FischeT-PetTosian (Game 
No.lOl in Part IV of My Great Predecessors). 
In this way White avoids the possibility of an 
ending with opposite-coloured bishops, 
intensifies the pressure and soon wins a 
pawn.

Kramnik also won that day (this was his 
last win: he drew his eight remaining 
games), and with 4 out of 5 we were leading 
the race. But then I slightly stalled, making 
three successive draws.
In the sixth round against Short I ended 
up in a strategically hopeless position from a 
Closed Sicilian and extricated myself literally 
by a miracle. The inaccurate conversion of 
advantages against Korchnoi and Moro- 
zevich, and difficulties in games with Adams 
and Short, with whom I usually played very 
confidently - all these were symptoms of 
indifferent form. And also in the seventh 
round, when Anand unexpectedly gave me a 
pawn (cf. Game No.60, note to White’s 9th 
move), I was unable to create problems for 
my opponent. Then in the eighth round, 
after playing a Griinfeld well against Lpu- 
tian, on the 24th move I missed a chance to 
gain some advantage.
The leading positions at that moment 
were: Kasparov and Kramnik - 5V2 out of 8; 
Anand and Leko - 5. It was time to cast off 
the shackles, and in the ninth round I won 
with White in a Scotch against Timman (cf. 
Game N0.61, note to White’s 16th move), 
then in the tenth - a good Griinfeld with 
Black against Nikolic. I now had 7V2 out of 
10, a point more than Leko and Kramnik. In 
the n th  and 12th rounds I drew with them, 
having to conduct a difficult defence in a 
Griinfeld against Kramnik.
The result of these duels determined the 
fate of first place: before the last round I had 
8V2 out of 12, with Leko and Kramnik on T/i. 
At the finish both my pursuers had Black 
and contented themselves with draws. 
Therefore in my ‘white’ game with Judit 
Polgar a half-point would more than satisfy 
me. But at the very height of the opening 
battle I suddenly felt the urge to finish 
‘brilliantly’.

and Black’s chances are not worse (Anand-

However, the move I0...4?sf6 was also 
known to me: it was studied by my team in
preparation for the match with Anand 
(1995), and was suggested by Evgeny Pigu- 
sov. And suddenly our preparation was 
employed for the first time against me!

in return White does not obtain any imme­
diate pluses. But Black nevertheless has to 
spend time bringing the queen back, and 
White can try to exploit the weakening of 
the kingside.

After this simple reply I came to my 
senses and began cursing myself: White has 
no useful moves and not even a hint of 
compensation for the pawn. I felt an almost 
irresistible desire to resign, and it was only 
with difficulty that I forced myself into the 
mood for a tenacious resistance...
Incidentally, when after the round the 
journalists asked Kramnik: ‘Why did you so 
quickly agree a draw with Black?’, he replied: 
‘But I could not imagine that Kasparov 
would play like that with White!’. And, 
indeed, in such an important game with 
Polgar, against whom before this I had a 4-0 
score in ‘classical’ games, a defeat seemed 
almost unimaginable.

As a result, although I scored half a point 
less than in Wijk aan Zee 1999, there was no 
genuine battle for first place. From the press: 
‘In the opinion of many grandmasters, Kas­
parov was far from at his best, and he had an 
unusually large number of dubious positions. 
What told was a lack of practice. But, even 
though not in his optimal form, all the same 
he finished a point and a half ahead of his 
closest pursuers.’
Sergey Shipov: ‘Kasparov, achieved the 
round-by-round score planned in his training 
camp and even exceeded it by quarter of a 
point! There were no problems in the open­
ing. Anand and Kramnik were not at their 
best. In recent times Leko has obviously 
improved, but on seeing his game with van 
Wely, Kasparov was horrified and exclaimed: 
"If my successors will play the Sicilian so 
passively with White, I will have to stay in 
top-level chess for another 10 years!"
‘Morozevich can also be a real rival to Kas­
parov - I think that he has reached the main 
chasing group: Anand, Kramnik, Shirov and 
Leko... The gap between Kasparov and these 
five players is a result of differences in physical 
condition (Garry Kimovich, the eldest of them, 
is in the best shape!) and in opening prepara­
tion (again his work at home is more compe­
tently arranged). If these five do not close the 
gap, we will have to wait for some youngster...’

Fatal Choice
Double-Round Super-Toumament in Linares 
(27 February -10 March 2000): 1-2. Kasparov 
and Kramnik - 6 out of 10; 3-6. Leko, Anand, 
Khalifman and Sbirov - 4Vi.
After my victory in Wijk aan Zee I also 
wanted to perform worthily in Linares: by 
that time the question of an autumn world 
championship had finally been decided. Its 
prize fund of two million dollars was pro­
vided by a London company ‘Brain Games’, 
set up on the initiative of Raymond Keene. 
But my opponent, Anand, would not sign 
the contract, and the situation remained 
unclear, which unnerved both players.
I wasn’t able to prepare fully for this cate­
gory 21 super-toumament. Because of uncer­
tainty regarding its staging I was late in 
receiving my invitation - after I had already 
become involved in my renovated Kas- 
parovChess site with the organization of an 
international knock-out tournament of 16 
grandmasters with a time control of 60 
minutes per game (9-20 February 2000). Of 
course, I also played in it: I beat Barua (2-0), 
van Wely and Adams (each 1V2-V2), but in the 
final I unexpectedly lost to Piket (Vj-i ’/ j).
I remember my trainer saying sadly: 'Once 
again you have had to sacrifice yourself for the 
future of chess.’ Indeed, the internet used up a 
mass of energy and time. Between March and 
June of that year our company organised 
another unique knock-out tournament: the 
first world championship in chess history for 
general education schools. Already then I was 
dreaming of promoting a teaching program 
in schools and organizing chess enthusiasts 
throughout the world via the internet. An­
other dream was to write a book about recent 
chess history, to show its constant progress 
through the play of the world champions, and 
it was precisely then that I began working on
creating the series My Great Predecessors...
The line-up of Linares 2000, although 
slightly shortened, was fully traditional: only 
the old-timer Topalov, who was experienc­
ing a crisis, was replaced by the new FIDE 
champion Khalifman. The organisers col­
lided head-on with all the interested per­
sons, provoking arguments about who was 
now the world champion. Some said that the 
champion was Khalifman, and that Kas­
parov was simply the strongest player, but 
others saw things differently: ‘For llyumzhi- 
nov and perhaps a few people pom  Lenin­
grad it is Khalifman, but the overwhelming 
majority do not consider it to be him. We 
have one world champion...’ (Korchnoi).
Dokhoian and I felt that my creative 
surge, which began in 1999, was already on 
the wane: there was no sign of the freshness 
and energy of the previous year. And 
throughout the tournament I was pursued 
by ‘rises and falls’, even during the course of 
individual games. Nevertheless, the start 
went well: a theoretical duel with Shirov, 
who employed the Petroff Defence, was 
heading for a draw after a sharp tactical 
skirmish, when Alexey suddenly blundered a 
piece, and I was able to win an endgame 
with rook, bishop and two pawns (g and h) 
against rook and three pawns (f, g and h).
In the second round I had an equally sharp 
battle in a Griinfeld with Khalifman: on the 
20th move I missed a chance to seize the 
initiative, and the result was a draw. Also 
interesting was the course taken by my third 
round game with Kramnik, who employed a 
dubious novelty in the Petroff Defence (cf. 
Game No.82, note to White’s 10th move). I 
found the correct set-up, then I went slightly 
wrong, but Kramnik gave me a chance to 
cany out an unusual attack. Alas, short of 
time, I allowed the exchange of my important 
bishop, and on move 22 we agreed a draw.

Carry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
In the fourth Tound I won with Black 
against Anand, who played surprisingly 
uncertainly (cf. Game No.26, note to Black’s 
9th move), then in the fifth round I pressed 
on Leko’s position in a Griinfeld with 5 1®rb3, 
but was unable to extract anything Teal - a 
dTaw in a pawn endgame on the 39th move.
The positions in the Tace afteT the first 
cycle were: Kasparov and Kramnik - 31/* out 
of 5; Leko - iVr, Shirov and Khalifman - 2; 
Anand - V/i. The second cycle was also not 
distinguished by the number of decisive 
games: in the eighth round Khalifman won 
against Leko and in the ninth he lost to 
Anand, but the remaining 13 games con­
cluded peacefully. The tournament was a 
record one for the number of draws, al­
though many of them were fighting games.
For me the second cycle began with a bat­
tle against Shirov - another crazy Sicilian. 
From the opening I obtained a dangerous 
position (cf. Game N0.76, notes to Black’s 6th 
move and Black’s 10th move), then I seized 
the initiative, but on the 3lst move I missed 
a real winning chance, and my opponent 
forced a draw. In the seventh round I had 
good chances against Khalifman in a French 
Defence, but I again played inaaccurately, 
and Black set up a fortress.
In the eighth round came the second, key 
game with Vladimir Kramnik. The winner of 
this encounter would almost certainly take 
sole first place in the tournament. With 
White Kramnik tried to impose a battle on 
his opening territory.

this is a kind of ‘anti-Griinfeld’, and it was 
precisely the Griinfeld Defence that I wanted

'An unusual and highly interesting, large-

At the finish I felt extremely tired. In the 
ninth round against Leko I employed the 
variation with 6...£ig4 in the Najdorf, ob­
tained a more or less tolerable endgame (cf. 
Game N0.63, note to Black's 10th move), but 
with my ridiculous 20th move I suddenly 
gave up my a6-pawn. In his fright Leko 
thought for a long time, captured the pawn 
- and promptly squandered his entire 
advantage.
A draw was also the result in my ‘white’ 
game with Anand, who was sharing 3rd-6th
2 9 8

Second Peak
places. I gained some advantage from the 
opening (cf. Game No.82, note to White’s 
10th move), but I was unsettled by the 
thought that, in the event of me winning, 
Vishy would finish last on his own, and the 
sponsors’ interest in our match would cool. I 
was tormented by the ‘ghost of Karpov in Las 
Palmas 1996’: I was in danger of losing my 
opponent! Although Anand was literally 
shaking with fright, I was also unable to play 
normally, and after a senes of exchanges we 
concluded peace.
Kramnik also drew, and we shared first 
place, with all our four tie-break indicators 
turning out to be identical! The fifth indicator 
was a drawing of lots. Which of us two would 
be awarded the traditional prize for the 
Linares winner - a model of a mining derrick? 
To avoid this question being decided by the 
blind will of chance, the organisers suggested 
we play a blitz decider. And here, in Dok- 
hoian’s opinion, I made an inexcusable 
psychological mistake: I said that I already 
had several such trophies, and with a ‘Baku- 
like grand gesture’ I gave up this prize to 
Kramnik. My decision proved to be symbolic: 
in the spring Kramnik took the prize, and in 
the autumn he took the world title! Of course, 
I should have agreed to the blitz, but I was 
irresolute, assuming that in the autumn I 
would be playing a match with Anand...
After Linares I flew to Moscow, while 
Kramnik, Anand and Shirov went off to an 
exhibition tournament in Monte Carlo. For a 
further ten days the organisers of the Lon­
don match tried to persuade Anand to sign 
the contract, but after a long delay Vishy 
refused, stating: ‘The negotiations were cut 
short mainly in view of the absence of any 
guarantees for me. I suggested different 
variations, but in vain.’
I don’t know precisely what mountains of 
gold llyumzhinov promised him, but as a
result Anand did not miscalculate: at the 
end of 2000 he won the third FIDE knock-out 
championship, crushing Shirov in the final 
(3V2-V2).
Again I was left without an opponent, and 
I urgently had to decide what to do next. 
With whom should I now play a match - 
Kramnik or Shirov? Dokhoian thought that 
without hesitation the 1998 challenger 
Shirov should be chosen. But I objected: after 
all, in the competitive respect this was not 
interesting - in ‘classical’ play against Shirov 
I had an overwhelming score (+8=8). By 
contrast with Kramnik the score was equal 
(+3-3=17), many games had proved difficult 
for me, and it was clear to everyone that he 
was the most dangerous opponent. And I 
was convinced: the world champion was 
obliged to play against the strongest! I 
wanted to accept a genuinely serious chal­
lenge - that was the style of my entire life.
And I chose Kramnik. He quickly agreed, 
after requesting $50,000 in expenses for 
match preparations, and admitting: 'First I 
consulted with Anand and I still don’t under­
stand why they didn’t come to an agree­
ment.’ Of course, a clause about a return 
match should have been included in the 
contract, and Kramnik would not have 
objected. In the given instance this was a 
sensible idea, since the challenger had not 
participated in the organization of the 
match, he had not gathered the money for 
its staging, as happened in ancient times, 
and he was presented with all this on a silver 
platter (such a sinecure was unprecedented 
in chess history!), moreover without having 
to qualify - and after his win he tn'ed to 
persuade everyone that I must play in a 
qualifier... But all my life I had spoken out 
against obligatory return matches - and I 
decided not to make an exception.
For this choice I was to pay bitterly.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
Double Hat-Trick
International Tournament in Sarajevo (16-29 
May 2000): l. Kasparov - S'A out of ll; 2-3. 
Adams and Shirov - 8; 4-6. Morozevich, 
Topalov and Bareev - 6; 7 .1.Sokolov - 4V2; 8- 
11. Movsesian, Short, Kir.Georgiev and 
M.Gurevich - 4; 12. Bacrot - 3.
After Linares I won a rapidplay tourna­
ment (Reykjavik, 1-2 April 2000), taking first 
place in my group (4Vi out of 5), before 
defeating Wojtkiewicz (1V2-V2) and, in the 
final, Anand (l-l; 2-0). And then I began 
preparing for the category 19 super- 
tournament in Sarajevo, timed to coincide 
with the 40th anniversary of the well-known 
Bosna Club, for which I had appeared in the 
mid-1990s.
On this occasion there were not 10 players 
in the tournament, but 12: the eight grand­
masters from the previous year and four 
newcomers. Again, like a year earlier, Kram­
nik declined to play, having begun active 
preparations for our match in the autumn, 
and again he was replaced by Short, who 
lived not far away in Greece.
Shirov was in brilliant form, having evi­
dently decided to demonstrate to the chess 
world that he was the ‘lawful challenger since 
1998’. True, at the start Alexey was unable to 
convert a sound extra pawn in his game with 
Adams, but then he began crushing one 
opponent after another and he took the lead.
In the first round I was paired with the 17- 
year-old French prodigy Etienne Bacrot, who 
at that time was being trained by my former 
long-standing mentor Alexander Nikitin. For 
him this was a battle of the pupils! And 
whereas on that day (and on others) many 
seconds preferred the relaxed atmosphere of 
the press centre, Nikitin and Dokhoian sat 
rooted on one of the front rows of the play­
ing hall.

Since the time of my preparations for the 
match with Short (1993) I was unable to 
decide wbicb was stronger here - 12 Wle4, 
forcing ...f7-f5 (control of tbe e4-square!), or 
12 #f3, allowing ...f7-f6, for example:
12.. .£lb4! (I2...1rd413 £>c3 £>xc3 1 4 lrxc3! c5

A novelty! The capture with tbe bishop 
makes sense after ...f7-f5, since now Black 
does not have ...f7-f6, and after ...d7-d6 
followed by ...dxe5 and fxe5 White acquires 
a passed pawn. In tbe event of tbe alterna­

third rank is free for the rook raid to a3.
23.. .H5!
Exploiting the chance opportunity, Black 
tries to set up a fortress. After 23-..'4>e6 24 h5

Black cannot keep pace with the movements

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
After this good start I began to have prob­
lems. In the second round, with Black in a 
Sicilian (cf. Game No.99, note to White’s 8th 
move), I completely outplayed Adams, but 
was unable to finish him off. In the third 
round, with White in a French, I with diffi­
culty won a very nervy game against Gure­
vich. Then I gained a draw with Topalov (l d4 
d5 2 c4 c6 3 £>f3 £>f6 4 £>c3 e6 5 g3 £)bd7 6 
g3 dxc4l, etc.) and easily defeated Ivan 
Sokolov, who failed to equalise in a Petroff 
Defence (cf. Game No.82, note to White’s 
10th move).
In the sixth round with Short I again had a 
winning position in a Sicilian, but again I did 
not finish him off. In the seventh round I had 
a nervy, crazy duel with Morozevich: attack­
ing, I gave up a mass of pawns and should 
have lost, but on the 18th move my oppo­
nent played his queen to the wrong square 
and the result was a draw.
In the eighth round I had Black against 
the leader - Shirov, who was half a point 
ahead of me, and I employed the fighting 
novelty ll...Wb6 in my traditional Najdorf. 
But Alexey played for the result and did not 
seek a refutation, going into a slightly better 
endgame (cf. Game No.63, note to White’s 
11th move) - a draw on the 27th move. 
Since our closest pursuers won, before the 
final three founds the battle for first place 
sharply intensified: Shirov - 6 out of 8; 
Kasparov, Morozevich and Adams - S'A.
Vladimir Barsky: ‘Shirov was playing 
splendidly, and it appeared that a sensation 
was on the cards. Of course, Kasparov was not 
bound to win all the tournaments in succes­
sion, but for a very long time he had not had 
any other results. Shirov could have earned 
the applause of the entire chess world - it 
seemed all that was needed was a little more 
effort, and he would displace Kasparov from 
his customary first place... But here a new
hero came to the fore - Sergey Movsesian.'
The 21-year-old Armenian Grandmaster, 
then living in the Czech Republic, who before 
this was on 2 out of 8, scintillated in rounds 
9 and 10 with sensational wins over Moro­
zevich and Shirov!
As for me, like a year earlier I managed to 
win all three of my remaining games. The 
win over Bareev was a very difficult one: he 
faltered only on the threshold of my time- 
trouble in a slightly inferior double-rook 
endgame. Then I crushed Kiril Georgiev in a 
Sicilian and before the last round I was at 
last leading the race: Kasparov - 7'A out of 
10; Shirov and Adams - 7.
My remaining game was with Black 
against the formidable Sergey Movsesian. 
Taking account of the fact that both my 
pursuers were very determined (and in the 
end both won!), to take sole first place I had 
to aim for a win, but remember that in the 
event of a loss I might finish third. Therefore 
it would have been unjustified heroism to 
plunge into battle under the motto ‘death or 
glory’.
Our duel also had a personal aspect. In 
the summer of 1999 during the FIDE knock­
out world championship in Las Vegas, while 
customarily criticising the ‘tournament of a 
hundred’ as unsuitable for determining the 
strongest player on the planet, I tried to 
assess objectively the chances of the quarter- 
finalists and I arbitrarily divided the grand­
masters into four groups: the ‘favourites' 
Kramnik and Shirov, the ‘solid’ Adams and 
Khalifman, the ‘unpredictable’ Polgar - and 
the ‘tourists’ 
Akopian, 
Nisipeanu and 
Movsesian (curiously, both ‘favourites’ went 
out in the quarter-finals, and the tourna­
ment was won by the ‘solid’ Khalifman, who 
defeated Polgar, Nisipeanu and Akopian). 
Unexpectedly Sergey was offended by my 
jocular term ‘tourists' and he sharply ex-
304

Second Peak
pressed his objections in the press. Now this 
‘tourist’ was certainly intending to take my 
scalp as a souvenir and to become the 
‘conquerer of the kings’!
In principle, my opponent's fighting mood 
suited me. After taking all the factors into 
account I planned my game strategy - I 
chose a flexible Sicilian set-up, in order to 
launch a counter-attack at the first oppor­
tunity.

14...^a4 15 ^e2 jLe7 is also not bad. 
While there are many pieces on the board, 
White’s material advantage is impercepti­
ble, whereas his pawns are spoiled, his king 
is exposed, and it experiences greater dis­
comfort that its black opponent. Such 
compensation is something one can only 
dream of!
15 £>e2 JLe7
After the game Sergey said that van Wely 
had placed his knight on a4 and never played 
,.JLe7 and ...0-0. This is a psychological prob­
lem: when behind on material you want to do 
something immediately. But for a successful 
attack Black has to complete his development 
and bring all his pieces into play.
16 gS 0-0! 17 h4 £sa4!
An absolutely natural novelty: there is no 
reason to rush with ...d6-d5, although 17...d5 
18 h5 (Zagrebelny-Lingnau, Berlin 1993)
I8...£>a4 is also acceptable. The knight on a4 
is no weaker in the attack than a rook, and is 
even better!
Here I could not resist the temptation - I 
stood up from my board to see how things 
were going with my pursuers. And almost 
with relief I saw that both Shirov and Adams 
were confidently heading for a win. Now I 
definitely knew that I had to forget about
them, concentrate on my own game and 
win at all costs. When I returned to the 
board, all thoughts about cautious play were 
put out of my mind...
18 JLcl?!
A significant delay. 18 hs is more logical, 
although here after I8...£>e5 Black also has 
comfortable play: 19 ^.d2?! dsl, and on d2 
the bishop is just as awkwardly placed as on 
cl, or 19 ild4 £>c4 (Stohl).
18.. .£te5 19 h5
It is already hard to offer White any good 
advice. If 19 f4? there is the typical reaction
19.. .£>xd3 20 cxd3 ds! - Black even undou­
bles the opponent’s pawns, but now his 
bishops come into play: 21 exds (21 e5? d4 
and wins) 21...^.xd5, and after the rook 
moves from h i there follows 22...Sb8! with 
the threat of ...b5-b4 and a strong attack.
19.. .d5
This blow in the centre suggests itself 
(both ...f7-f6 and ...bs-b4 are threatened).
19 .f5 (Stohl) is not so clear, but serious 
consideration should have been given to

White resigned (0-1), and applause broke 
out in the hall.
So, ‘plus six’ - and a sixth successive vic­
tory in super-toumaments, a kind of double 
hat-trick: two in Wijk aan Zee, two in Linares 
and two in Sarajevo.
Vladimir Barsky: ‘A brilliant achievement 
by Kasparov. However, the tournament has 
shown that here is no gulf between him and 
the ‘rest of the world’. Kasparov is superior to 
his rivals mainly in physical preparation 
(remember that he again scored 3 out of 3 at 
the finish), and in his ability to organise his 
work on chess. In this second factor his de­
voted second Yuri Dokhoian deserves enor­
mous credit - Kasparov’s colossal knowledge 
is systematically 
arranged. Anyone who 
wants to fight for the title of the strongest 
player in the world must in the first instance 
surpass the 37-year-old Muscovite in these 
two components.'
This was my last ‘classical’ appearance 
before the autumn match for the world 
championship. A month later I played in a
308

double-cycle rapidplay tournament (Frank­
furt am Main, 22-25 June 2000): 1. Anand - 
7V2 out of 10; 2. Kasparov - 6; 3. Kramnik - 
5; 4. Sbirov -  4V2; 5-6. Leko and Morozevicb - 
y /2 . Burning with desire to repeat my tri­
umph of the previous year, I started with 2V2 
out of 3, then made three draws - and 
disintegrated, losing with White to Leko 
from an obviously better position. And in 
July, as usual, I set off with my team for a 
lengthy training session in Croatia.
Match with Kramnik
World Championship Match Kasparov -  
Kramnik (London, 7 October - 2 November 
2000): 6V2-8V2.
For understandable reasons I have never 
spoken in detail about my match with 
Vladimir Kramnik. My preparations for it 
were serious, but, unfortunately, inflexible 
and therefore ineffective: hardly any of our 
opening ideas came in useful in the match 
and they were employed only in subsequent 
tournaments. The state of my nervous 
system was also far from ideal. Emotional 
fatigue had accumulated from the constant 
tournament victories and endless organiza­
tional problems with internet projects. I was 
also wom out by a two-year lawsuit with my 
former wife living in the USA, for the right to 
bring my daughter Polina to Moscow at least 
once a year.
We held two big training sessions - in the 
summer on the Adriatic coast and in Sep­
tember on the outskirts of Moscow. On this 
occasion my usual team of Yuri Dokhoian 
and Alexander Shakarov was joined by the 
young grandmasters Andrey Kharlov and 
Mikhail Kobalia. At various stages Boris 
Alterman and Michael Adams also helped.
For White the main emphasis was placed 
on 1 e4. 1 d4 was studied superficially, and
only just before the match did I look a little at 
1 c4 with Boris Gulko, who was passing 
through Moscow. Because of this narrow 
repertoire, in the course of the match I lacked 
flexibility. On the other hand, after 1 e4 we 
made appreciable progress in all of the 
openings from Kramnik’s repertoire: we 
demolished the Petroff Defence (on the back 
of this I beat Adams - Came No.82), we 
combed through the Sveshnikov and Rauzer 
Variations in the Sicilian, and we renovated 
both the Caro-Kann with 3 e5 -&f5 4 £sc3 (in 
this way I later won against Karpov - Game 
No.77), and the French with 3 £sd2 - for 
example, 3...C5 4 £)gf3 £sf6 5 e5 £)fd7 6 c3 
£sc6 7 ^.d3 Wb6 8 0-0 (Kasparov-Bareev, 1st 
match game, Cannes (rapid) 2001) or 4...cxd4 
5 exd5 #xd5 6 &c4 »d6 7 0-0 £>f6 8 Sell? 
Jte7 9 £se4 (Kasparov-Gelfand, Astana 2001).
But we didn’t look at l...e5 2 £sf3 £sc6: 
Kramnik hardly ever played this, and I 
thought that starting from nothing it would 
be too much trouble to prepare for both the 
Ruy Lopez and the Scotch Game. It was only 
at the end of the second session that I said: 
we ought to look at the Berlin Defence 
(Kramnik employed it at Wijk aan Zee in 
1999 against Topalov and reached an infe­
rior endgame), but, although we had a 
Spanish expert in Adams, no deep analysis 
was made. Incidentally, I might have studied 
this new segment of theory back in the 
autumn of 1998, during my Prague match 
with Timman: according to his second, Ivan 
Sokolov, against 1 e4 he had prepared the 
‘Berlin Wall’. Alas, as fate would have it, at 
the time I played only 1 d4.
With Black I did not see any particular 
problems after 1 £tf3 £sf6 2 c4 (Game N0.64), 
and against 1 d4 I chose the well-tested 
Griinfeld Defence, tempted by the idea of 
‘engineer Garry’s hyperboloid’ - to refine 
and ‘sharpen’ on the computer all the main
309

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
forcing lines of this opening. After spending 
a mass of time, we made enormous progress 
in many directions, looking at literally every­
thing - apart from the old, ‘harmless’ line 7 
£rf3 c5 8 JLe3 in the main variation. And it 
was this that Kramnik employed!
I remember that when, just in case, I 
asked Sergey Shipov to give me some advice 
for Black in the Catalan, he exclaimed anx­
iously: ‘What, do you only have the Griin- 
feld?’ No, in reserve we also had the Queen’s 
Gambit Accepted - it was played by Kharlov, 
and we looked at it a bit. The black positions 
arising in this opening were not altogether 
to my taste, but I knew them and I was 
hoping to defend myself. In subsequent 
meetings with Kramnik the ‘OGA’ served me 
quite well, but in the first attempts - the 4th 
and 6th games of the match - things were 
difficult, and as an emergency I had to 
include the Nimzo-lndian Defence.
In addition I fairly wore myself out by ana­
lyzing l  e4 for Kramnik. He used to employ 
this move very rarely (against me in the mid- 
1990s, and after 1996 only in blitz games), 
but in the summer he used it to beat Leko in 
a TV exhibition match with a time control of 
one hour for the game (Cologne, 14th Au­
gust 2000). However, here also my efforts 
were in vain: in the match with me Kramnik 
did not play this.
It was with this wealth of, as it soon tran­
spired, superfluous opening knowledge that 
I arrived for the match, commenting on 5th 
October at a press conference before the 
start: ‘Kramnik is a player of universal style, 
which makes him a very dangerous oppo­
nent.’ In the given instance the marked 
difference in the ratings of the players - 
2849 against 2770 - did not play any role: it 
was meeting between grandmasters of the 
same class.
The challenger’s official helpers were Ev­
geny Bareev, Miguel lllescas and Joel Lautier. 
But other grandmasters also took part in his 
preparations - among them Vladimir Be­
likov, Sergey Dolmatov (my second in two 
matches with Karpov), Peter Svidler and 
Boris Gelfand, who had come to my place for 
a training session lasting several days before 
the proposed match with Shirov (1998). 
Moreover, Bon's did not consider it necessary 
to wam me that he was now helping my 
opponent. As Kramnik put it, ‘there was no 
systematic work’, but 'at least once a fort­
night they spoke on the phone’ and ‘ex­
changed certain ideas - say, about some 
interesting games’. (Recently Gelfand dis­
closed that he was offered my help before 
his 2012 match with Anand, and he angrily 
declined: how could he accept, since Kas­
parov had helped Anand before the 2010 
match with Topalov? But I only gave the 
champion a few bits of advice by telephone).
Bareev: ‘The team selected was an interna­
tional one, and in the main each worked at 
home, with Kramnik himself holding several 
training sessions with various players... Each 
was responsible for his own personal front. I 
worked on the white pieces, except for the 
Griinfeld Defence. The ‘Berlin Wall’ was pre­
pared by Dolmatov and Kramnik working 
together for about two weeks. As a matter of 
fact, neither Lautier nor I knew what was our 
main weapon against l e4... Kramnik and 
Lautier worked on the Scotch Game. And on 
the main opening for White - the Griinfeld 
Defence - it was lllescas who carried out some 
very serious work.’
The chief arbiter was Andrzej Filipowicz 
(Poland). In the spirit of the times the match 
was of 16 games (and not 20, as in the 1995 
match with Anand), but we still played four 
times a week - on Tuesdays, Thursdays, 
Saturdays and Sundays, with a time control 
of 40 moves in two hours, 20 in an hour, and
310

Second Peak
half an hour for the rest of the game. As has 
already been mentioned, immediately after 
a game the players gave a press conference. 
And, for the first time in the history of such 
matches, before play an anti-computer 
control operated: the players had to pass 
through a special X-ray machine.
But in general the level of organization 
was markedly inferior to my London 
matches with Karpov (1986) and Short 
(1993). The hall of the Riverside Studios in 
which we played and the way to the press 
centre reminded Cenna Sosonko of a cinema 
in Leningrad, where in 1947 he saw the film 
Secret Agent - in fact the cinema looked 
somewhat superior...
When in the first game after my 1 e4 
there followed l...e5 2 £sf3 £*c6 3 ,&b5 
&f6!?, I glanced at my opponent, smiled and 
shook my head. On suddenly encountering 
the ‘Berlin Wall’, I was unable to gain even a 
hint of an advantage - a draw on the 26th 
move. How to breach Black’s defences in this 
‘tedious’ endgame, resembling those which 
arise in the Spanish Exchange Variation? 
From the very start the problem of the white 
pieces raised its head, a problem with which 
my team later struggled unsuccessfully for 
the entire match (cf. Game No.80, notes to 
Black’s 9th move and White’s 10th move).
Before the second game I was not in the 
best of moods, but I was confident about the 
soundness of my Griinfeld. However, an­
other surprise awaited me.

did not achieve anything. But I disregarded 
the simple capture on b7, since Ivanchuk 
had condemned it in Informator No.54 
because of ll..JLxf3 12 gxf3 £sc6.

Also natural! After this I experienced a 
shock: where was Ivanchuk’s promised ‘clear 
advantage for Black’? And I realised just how 
carefully my opponent had trawled though 
my ‘black’ games. White’s novelty is a good 
one, of course, but objectively there is noth­
ing amazing about it - apart from the great 
psychological effect!
Frankly speaking, I was angered when this 
game was voted the theoretically most 
important in the 80th volume of Informator, 
whereas the eighth with the fantastic dis­
covery I6...£lc7! was placed only second. 
After all, at the time I6...£lc7 was not sug­
gested by any computer, whereas the moves 
11 Sxb7 and 13 -&c4 are fairly obvious. Is it 
possible that the experts were swayed by the 
competitive and psychological importance 
of the game?

This was an important moment: wanting 
to escape from the unpleasant pressure, I 
decided to give up a pawn here, hoping for 
the drawing tendencies of opposite-coloured 
bishops.

that after 18 JLb6 Wb4 19 a3! Wb2 20 Wxb2

At first sight the weakness of the oppo­

deficit. But in fact his position is uneasy: the 
d5-bishop is stronger than its opponent.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
A discouraging start to the match: it was 
not even so much the score, but rather my 
state of mind. I was shocked by the *holes’ in 
my opening repertoire that had been imme­
diately revealed, both for White and for Black. 
I did not know how to breach the ‘Berlin Wall’, 
and I had no desire to check what other 
surprises Kramnik would spring on me in the 
Griinfeld Defence. Almost my entire prepara­
tion had gone down the drain and I had to 
begin working virtually from zero!
Sosonko: 'As Boris Spassky used to say, in 
world championship matches it is important, 
expressing it in wrestling language, to keep 
your opponent on the mat, to create constant 
negative emotions in him. At the start of the 
match Kramnik has been more successful in 
this.'
In the third game, for the only time in the 
match, I was able to gain some advantage in 
the Berlin and to at least set Black problems. 
But Kramnik defended tenaciously and in 
time-trouble, when I began playing with fire, 
he could even have seized the initiative. 
Things concluded with a sharp endgame with 
connected passed pawns on opposite wings 
and a draw on the 54th move.
Subsequently with the white pieces I was 
not able to achieve anything at all (!) and a 
real battle developed only when I was Black.
Before the fourth game there was agonis­
ing indecision: should I or shouldn’t 1 play the 
Griinfeld Defence? We feverishly looked at 
various modifications of the main variation - 
now I was imagining tricks everywhere, and 
in the end I decided to change opening. This 
was a serious psychological concession: how 
much effort had been put into this defence 
before the match! Perhaps I should neverthe­
less have employed the Griinfeld right to the 
end (White doesn’t have a forced win there!), 
but the second game had left too bitter a 
taste in my mouth...
Thus it was that the Oueeen’s Gambit Ac­
cepted came on to the stage. Kramnik was 
somewhat surprised, he chose the variation 
with the exchange of queens (this was in 
accordance with his match strategy), and 
after another novelty he seized the initiative. 
On the 25th move I lost patience, launched a 
risky counterattack and reached a hopeless 
position. But after mutual mistakes in the 
second time scramble Kramnik missed a win, 
and the result was a highly dramatic draw on 
the 74th move.
This miraculous escape could have inspired 
me to great feats in the fifth game, played the 
following day, but this did not happen. On the 
eve of the match, on learning about the double 
games at weekends, Adams phoned and 
warned me: ‘Garry, bear it in mind: the one 
who has the white pieces on the Sunday will 
find it very difficult!’. Indeed, to play with full 
intensity after tense battles on the Saturday 
proved impossible, as was confirmed by the 
fifth, ninth and thirteenth games. In the fifth 
after the unexpected 1 c4 I gained a stable 
plus, but I played insipidly and failed to exploit 
some favourable chances, which led to a draw 
as early as the 25th move.
In the sixth game the Queen’s Gambit Ac­
cepted again occurred. This time Kramnik 
went in for complicated play, employing a 
novelty with a pawn sacrifice. I declined the 
gift and reached a normal position, but after 
a fierce battle, having passed the first time 
control, I made a serious mistake. My oppo­
nent was close to success, he won a pawn, on 
the 56th move he went chasing a second one, 
and - here literally by a miracle I found a 
spectacular draw by perpetual check. Another 
dramatic finish!
Kramnik was consoled by my terrible play in 
the seventh game: 1 c4 c5 2 £)f3 £>f6 3 d4 cxd4

4...e6 5 g3, threw me into a stupor) 5 £)c3 e6 6

Draw agreed: only Black can have the more 
pleasant position here.
The match was approaching its mid-point, 
and I did not see any ray of hope for myself: 
what to do next and how to regain my previ­
ous form was quite unclear (the situation 
partially resembled the first half of my 1995 
match with Anand). At this point, seeing my 
sufferings in the Queen’s Gambit Accepted, 
Dokhoian persuaded me to look at the 
Nimzo-lndian Defence. Such a restructuring 
in the course of the match was not easy, since 
all the free time had to be spend ‘reinventing 
the wheel’ both for Black, and for White. This 
work took an enormous amount of energy, 
which I later lacked for the play itself.
Nevertheless, before the eighth game I was 
in a good mood. Firstly, Adams and I had 
finally found the time for a proper analysis of 
the ‘Berlin’ and had found a worthy reply to 
the plan with ...'idS-cS (giving hope for the 
ninth game). And, secondly, an interesting 
novelty had been devised in a line employed 
by Kramnik against the Nimzo-lndian.

to his surprise (both at the board, and in

that after 23 Sfel (23 £ig3?! JLds) 23...Sxb2 
24 -&d4 Sc2 25 -&xb6 ^d5 “life is difficult for 
White’. However, according to Shipov, 26 jLf2 
would have given better chances of a success­
ful defence than in the game: ‘Black’s pieces 
are active, but there is nothing real’. Accord­
ing to Bareev, White has ‘clear equality:

Again the best, and more importantly, the 
psychologically correct decision: with time- 
trouble imminent, Kramnik simplifies the 
position at the cost of a pawn, hoping to 
gain a draw with the opposite-coloured 
bishops. He also considered other, far more 
complicated and risky continuations:

have to admit that I was content to have 
gained easy equality from the opening and 
was psychologically unprepared for the fact 
that within a few moves I would gain an 
obvious advantage. And I replied too 
quickly...

'An inexplicable blunder, immediately 
losing the advantage, and similar to the

Thus the first half of the match concluded 
with the score standing at rpA-3'A in Kram­
nik’s favour. I thought that the situation 
could still be repaired, and that I only 
needed to smoke my opponent out of his 
‘Berlin bunker'. But in the 9th game, played 
on a Sunday, Kramnik disconcerted me by 
unexpectedly rejecting his earlier 9..Jtd7 
followed by ...4c8 in favour of 9-h6. In my 
vexation I responded badly (cf. Game No.80, 
note to White’s 10th move), and as a result 
the prepared new strategic plan did not go 
into operation - a draw on the 3lst move.
To some extent this failure became deci­
sive: after it I was psychologically broken and 
I arrived for the 10th game in a terrible 
frame of mind. Due to chronic lack of sleep
my head was spinning - I was wom out by 
the lengthy night-time vigils at the board.

in some cases the knight on d6), and if

Bareev: Try remembering a worse game 
than this one in Kasparov’s career.' Kramnik: 
‘Probably the strangest game in the match. 
There is no way it can be called an opening 
win. It was obviously not Kasparov’s day. In 
general he calculates variations well, but here 
in a ‘pure calculating' position he became 
rattled. This happens both in matches, and in 
tournaments, when you are out of sorts and 
everything literally slips through your fin­
gers. ’
The score became 6-4 in the challenger’s 
favour. Arriving for the 11th game, I was 
tuned up for a ‘battle for Berlin’, but after l  
e4 e5 2 £)f3 £ic6 3 £b5 Kramnik made a 
wise move - he was the first to deviate, 
choosing the fashionable variation 3-..a6 4 
ia 4  £)f6 5 0-0 b5 6 i.b3 i.c5 Within 15 
minutes we reached an endgame somewhat 
favourable for White with rook and two 
pawns against two bishops, known from the 
game Kupreichik-Malaniuk (Munster 1995) 
and tested by me in a training game with 
Adams. 
But 
Kramnik 
defended 
more 
strongly and set up a fortress. The dismal 
outcome for me was another toothless draw 
with White.
And so, five games before the finish, I re­
mained on ‘minus two’ and it was still 
unclear how I was going to make up ground. 
But the 12th game was played on the birth­
day of my son Vadik (he was four years old), 
and I was hoping to engage in a genuine 
battle in the Nimzo-lndian, despite the long­
standing dismal experience in the 4 e3 
variation. After all, from the opening I al­
ways reached normal positions!
In principle Kramnik could already have
325

‘quietened’ me with l  <2^3 (as in fact oc­
curred in the 14th game), but he apparently 
wanted to conclude the battle in crushing 
style. He sacrificed a pawn, launched an 
attack (cf. Game No.69, note to Black’s 7th 
move) and for the only time in the match he 
overstepped the mark, allowing me real 
winning chances.

At this the match effectively concluded: a 
score of 7-5 with just four games to go - 
without the white pieces! After the 12th 
game I suffered a sleepless night (fancy 
missing such a chance!), and I was simply 
not in any state to play the next day. For the 
13th game I prepared an interesting idea in 
the variation of the Ruy Lopez from the llth, 
but Kramnik again chose the Berlin Defence 
and moved his king to e8, avoiding the 
preparation by myself and Adams. AfteT
losing the thread of the game, I made a 
couple of second-rate moves and immedi­
ately, now in a slightly inferior position, I 
offered a draw (cf. Game No.80, note to 
Black’s 10th move). Kramnik: 7 think that 
Kasparov was obliged to continue the game, 
but he could not find the strength to do this.’
It appeared to be all over. But in the 14th 
game my opponent unexpectedly afforded 
me one moTe chance to fight foT a win. After 
playing 1 £rf3, he played the English Open­
ing very unconvincingly (cf. Game No.23 in 
Kasparov vs. Karpov 1986-87, note to White’s 
10th move). What told, apparently, was the 
enormous tension, with which I was famil­
iar, caused by the burning proximity of the 
goal. Black began to take the initiative, but 
Kramnik found a subtle pawn sacrifice and 
defended himself. HoweveT, on the 34th 
move he suddenly went in foT the exchange 
of queens and found himself in a difficult 
endgame.

Carry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
A mistake, which was not noticed by the 
commentators. White should have com­
bated the menacing c-pawn with 37 2b6 - 
here the rook does not come under attack 
and in some cases there is a check from b5-
37.. .C3?
By breaking away from its remaining 
forces, the pawn become too vulnerable. 
According to my opponent’s analysis,
37.. .*4+8! 38 4g2 4e7 39 Sdl e5! would have 
given me good chances of success, when the 
desperate 40 a4(?l) is fatal because of

would have remained for White was the

4d6 - ‘despite the material equality, the 
endgame is very dangerous for him: the f3- 
pawn is weak, and the black king is all the

c5’ (Kramnik). After 43 a3 4d5 44 4e2 f6 
there is also the threat of ...g6-g5.

‘Quickly played: there was no time for

This was my last real chance of saving the

8-8 I would have retained my title. But now 
the score became 8-6. In the 15th game in 
desperation I played 1 d4 and employed the 
Catalan Opening. Kramnik ‘partially forgot’ 
the theory and thought foT a long time, but 
did not in fact equalise. However, I was 
unable to develop my initiative and on the 
39th move, now in an equal endgame, I 
offered a draw. And I congraulated my 
successor on his deserved victory in the

chose the correct tactics. I did not aim for 
immediate equality from the opening, but I 
was ready for a dijficult and prolonged 
defence of inferior positions. To some extent 
this was a novel approach.’
Indeed, Kramnik realised full well the 
danger of direct clashes and he endeavoured 
to avoid over-forcing ‘computer’ variations, 
having learned from the memorable 10th 
game of my 1995 match with Anand (Game 
No.19). Thus, in the analysis of the ‘Berlin’ 
endgame the computer is of little use, and 
this defence was deemed 'a good choice 
against Kasparov’. In his euphoria after the 
victory Bareev talked about ‘the triumph of 
human over computer preparation’, and he 
predicted: ‘Is it really possible to take the 
Berlin Defence seriously? Within six months it 
will be destroyed, and in ‘Informator’ there 
will be all the analyses of how White wins.’ 
But 13 years have already passed, and even 
now the ‘Berlin’ is played by many grand­
masters - no one has even come close to 
refuting it...
Speaking more broadly, I can say that 
Kramnik arrived for our match with new 
ideas and he made a great contribution to 
the further development of chess. The 
opening theory, philosophical outlook on the 
opening and tastes of numerous players in 
the early 21st century were formed under 
the influence of this match and the 14th 
world champion. For a time his approach to 
chess became the dominating one.
As for myself, I overestimated the role of 
computer analysis, I did not get the feel of 
my opponent, and I was unable to withstand 
the intensity of a battle in which much had 
to be devised along the way. The wound 
suffered in the second game proved impos­
sible to heal. I was let down by defects in my 
psychological preparation and a lack of 
nervous energy. I did not have alongside me 
an experienced, top-class grandmaster, and 
an overall conception of the match was not 
devised.
In that historic autumn, fate punished me 
for my excessive self-confidence and lack of 
practicality.

Chapter Three
Life after Death
Farewell to Wijk aan Zee
International Tournament in Wijk aan Zee 
(12-28 January 2001): 1. Kasparov - 9 out of 
13; 2. Anand - 8V21 3-4. Kramnik and Ivan­
chuk - 8; 5-7. Adams, Morozevich and Shirov 
- 7V2; 8. Leko - 6V2; 9. Topalov - 5Vi; 10-11. 
Fedorov and van Wely - 5; 12-13. Piket and 
Tiviakov - 4V2; 14. Timman - 4.
In my third Wijk aan Zee, a category 19 
super-toumament, the situation was un­
usually intriguing: I was now playing as an 
ex-world champion, which was psychologi­
cally difficult and uncustomary, and my 
main rivals were the two new champions - 
Vladimir Kramnik (in the historic line) and 
Vishy Anand (in the FIDE line). For me this 
was a very important test: I needed to dem­
onstrate that the London match had been 
merely a temporary failure, and not a total 
catastrophe.
I started very well, using two blacks to 
maximum effect: without problems I de­
feated Tiviakov and Fedorov in closed varia­
tions of the Sicilian - 2 out of 2! But when I 
met Anand after a free day, I realised that I 
would not have an easy life in the event.
In a Ruy Lopez with 3.a6 Vishy chose
5....&C5 (instead of 5-b5 6 Ab3 .&C5, as 
Kramnik played against me, llth  match 
game, London 2000) and gained equal 
chances, but suddenly he embarked on a 
dubious venture on the queenside and 
reached a losing position.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
25 #C2?
‘In the evening, when we were quietly 
dining in the hotel restaurant’, writes An- 
and’s trainer Elzibar Ubilava, ‘Kasparov came 
up to our table and said that, after analyzing 
the game with Fritz, he had found the fol­
lowing winning variation for White: 25 Hxa6 
#xc3 26 Sxf7 Eg8 27 Wfl! (it was this simple 
move, with the threats ofWxbS, 2/8 and 5 a8, 
that I overlooked - G.K.) 27...*5^8 (27...Wxd2 
28 2a8) 28 Sxg7 (28 Zf8(d7) is also decisive, 
and even 28 Wxb5 
xf7 29 Qrfl - G.K)
28.. .<&>xg7 29 Sxd6 2f8 30 #xb5 Wxe3+ 31 
<&>hl’. Or 29...1rxe3+ 30 <&>hl #f4 31 Wxb5 
£sf7 32 Sd3! (Anand).
To this day I am perplexed as to why I did 
not play 25 2xa6l, even if I did not see this 
forced win: after all, the more modest 27 
#g4 (threatening Sa8) 27...*5^8 28 Sd7 
would also have been decisive. A win was 
missed for literally no apparent reason!
25.. .H6 26 1U3 2b6 27 Sfal 2c6 28 2la3 
(28 2xa6! 2xc3 29 ®d5 would still have 
retained an advantage) 28...a5!
Here I exposed myself to the ...d6-d5-d4 
advance (incidentally, as also happened in 
Las Palmas 1996 - Game No.33) and almost 
lost, but by a miracle I saved myself in a 
fearful time scramble:
29 &h2?! d5! 30 ®b5? d4! 31 bxa5 dxc3 32
£sb3 £>c5?! (32...^d6! 33 Wxe5 c2 34 £scl 
2e8 35 #93 ®a7 36 a6 ^xe4 was more 
accurate, winning) 33 fic4 Sb8 34 ®xc6 
#xc6 35 £ ixc5 #b5? (35—g5! 36 Ra(c)xc3 g4 
was correct, with a sudden attack) 36 Scxc3 
2 37 £sd7 Sb2 yi-’/i
In the fourth round I confidently equal­
ised against Ivanchuk in a rare line of the 
Scheveningen (cf. Game No.7, note to Black’s 
8th move) - a draw on the 28th move. After 
this a leading trio emerged: Kasparov, 
Kramnik and Shirov - 3 out of 4.
And then came the 5th round, the ultra- 
crucial duel with Kramnik. Against 1 e4 my 
opponent again erected the ‘Berlin Wall’, but 
on this occasion he tried to manage without 
...h7-h6. Dokhoian and I had also prepared for 
this: I gained some advantage (cf. Game 
No.80, note to Black’s 9th move) and, in Yuri’s 
opinion, I ‘played enterprisingly', but Black 
nevertheless managed to consolidate. And 
here some incredible events began to occur.

Life after Death
24.. .5h5?
‘A blunder. Even if it wasn’t such, all the 
same the move was pointless’, comments 
Kramnik, and he recommends 24-^f5 or
24.. .f5 (in my view, in order to exclude the 
reply 25 £ xj5, 24-f6! 25 exf6+ gxf6 with the 
idea of ...£*e6 is more accurate).
Of course, this is a black-out. Black’s entire 
strategy in the Berlin is aimed at preventing 
White from exploiting his pawn majority on 
the kingside, and it could have immediately 
collapsed. But I returned the favour...
25 £>g5?
Now White is merely somewhat better. 25 
g4! would have led to a decisive advantage. 
Usually such moves are not made because of 
the capture en passant, but after 25...hxg3+?
26 £wg3 Black loses material: 26...Sh4(xh3)
27 2xd4! 2xd4 28 £rf5+ and ^xd4 (this 
simple fork, which neither of us noticed, was 
later pointed out by some journalists). And 
after 25...Shh8 26 f5 he would have been left 
empty-handed, for example: 26...fihe8 27 c3 
&b5 28 2xd8 2xd8 29 4>e3, etc.
The exchange of such blunders was not 
only ‘an indication of the by no means bril­
liant form of both players’ (Kramnik), but also 
evidence of the extreme tension reigning at 
the board and the tournament. In such a 
difficult struggle, nerves play a decisive role.
25...fihh8 (out of harm’s way) 26 2d3 £te6 
27 £txe6 4xe6 28 S cd l 2d5 29 c4 2xd3 30 
Sxd3 a5 31 bxa5 2a8
After 31...bxa5 White simply has an extra 
pawn on the kingside.
32 Sa3 4>f5 33 4f3 2a6 (of course, not 
33.JSxa5? 34 Sxa5 bxa5 35 g4! or 33„.bxa5?!
34 2d3) 34 c5! (otherwise ...c6-c5) 34...f6?
The adventures continue: Black voluntar­
ily creates a dangerous passed pawn for his 
opponent! However, even after 34-bxc5! he 
would still have had to work hard to achieve 
a draw: 35 4e3 c4 36 2a4 c5 (36...C3? 37 
4d3) 37 4f3 c3 38 4e3 c4 (38...Sg6? 39 4d3) 
39 2 xc4 2xa5 40 a4 c5 414>d3, ‘and here the 
manoeuvre ...2a6-g6 can be tried, as well as 
the switching of the king via e6 to d5’ 
(Kramnik).
35 Se3l 2xa5 36 e6 2a8 37 e7 2e8 38 a4
4>g6 (38...g5 39 Se4l) 39 He6 4f7 40 2xc6?
The clamping 40 f5! would have won. Thus 
after 40...bxc5? 41 a5! c4 42 4>e3 Black suc­
cumbs to zugzwang. In a joint analysis after 
the game we looked at 40...g5 41 2xc6 2xe7 
and the unclear continuation 42 cxb6(?) cxb6 
43 Bxb6 Sa7, but 42 4>g4! with the unavoid­
able breakthrough of the king to the f6-pawn 
is decisive: 42...bxc5 43 a5! Se4+ 44 4>h5 Sa4 
45 Sxc7+ 4>e8 46 2xc5, etc.
In Informator Kramnik also recommended

43 Sa7! with tbe threat of a4-a5-a6, Sb7, a6-

into tbe pawn endgame (43...Sxe7 44 Sxe7+ 
4>xe7 45 4>e3), and bis passed c-pawn is 
stopped by tbe white king.
The more resilient 40...Sxe7 would also 
not have saved Black after 4 1 fixc6 Sd7 
(4l...bxc5? 42 a5l) 42 cxb6 cxb6 43 2xb6 <4>e7 
(43-Sd5 44 Sb5 or 43-.Ba7 44 2b4 Sa5 45

(45 <4>g4 Bg3+) 45...Sxe3+ 46 4>xe3 f5 '/*•'/*
Tbe painful errors in my games with An- 
and and Kramnik left an unpleasant after­
taste. In tbe sixth round came a fourth 
successive draw - with Black against Moro- 
zevich in 14 moves. Never before in Wijk aan 
Zee bad I started so feebly!
Sbirov burst ahead, after scoring three 
successive wins - over the Dutchmen Piket, 
Timman and van Wely. He had 5 out of 6 (!), 
with me, Kramnik and Morozevich on 4.
In order to rectify the situation somehow, 
I needed to win in the seventh round against 
Veselin Topalov. Knowing the character of 
my opponent, I had no doubts that there 
was a sharp battle in prospect.

Planning with ...iLc8 to kill two birds with

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
with a probable draw.
33 Wh8+ &f7 34 Ac3 1-0
Now it is all over.
This win - perhaps not error-free, but 
partly conducted in the ‘good old style’ - 
improved my mood and enabled me to 
reduce the gap behind the leader: Shirov - 
5V2 out of 7; Kasparov and Kramnik - 5.
In the eighth round Leko chose against 
me the ultra-solid Reti Opening, avoiding 
any theoretical discussions, and although I 
obtained a promising position, I could only 
gain a draw. But Shirov won against Tiviakov 
and increased his lead - 672 out of 8 (!), a 
point ahead of me and Kramnik. The ‘cards’ 
had favoured Alexey from the very start of 
the tournament, but he faced a difficult 
finish: Kasparov, Anand, Ivanchuk, Kramnik 
and Morozevich!
To retain chances of first place, in the 
ninth round I needed without fail to win 
against Shirov. And I did everything possible 
to gear myself up for a fight, especially since 
the game was played on an important date 
for me - 30 years since my father’s death. 
Unfortunately, before the game, for the first 
time in my chess career, I did not shake 
hands with my opponent, for which I gave 
this explanation on my ‘Club Kasparov’ 
website:
‘In recent times Shirov has on several oc­
casions made insulating public comments 
about me. My patience snapped when I 
learned that my match with Kramnik was 
supposedly fixed. When I arrived in Wijk aan 
Zee, we had a conversation about this. I said: 
"Alexey, everyone can become impassioned, 
this is understandable, but mistakes should 
be admitted, and so it would be good if you 
were to apologise.” He couldn’t give me a 
clear reply. After this I am unable to shake 
his hand...'

We spent a lot of time looking at this key 
position and we came to the conclusion that 
in all the three main branches of the varia­
tion Black has definite problems.

This bishop retreat to the edge of the

2) ll...i.f5 12 b4l, cramping Black (Shirov-

In both lines we had deep preparations

never in fact came).

By the exchange of knights Black has 
spoiled the opponent's pawn structure, but 
his knight has abandoned the important 
outpost at e4, while for the moment the 
white knight is still on e5.

been positional capitulation: Black has a 
‘bad’ knight with a weak pawn on d5, and 
White’s two bishops guarantee him a stable 
advantage.
15 f4
Here I spent a long time calculating the 
tempting variation 15 Jb<h7!? g6 16 #d2

Sael H 6  is correct. Now by 21 g4l? White 
regains the piece and obtains a very com­
fortable ending: 21...#g7 22 Wxg7+ ^xg7 23 
gxh5 gxh5 24 Se3, etc.
But, afraid of selling my advantage too 
cheaply, I was looking for a decisive attack - 
21 £>d7 lg7(?) 22 lf4! f6 23 £)xf8 Bxf8 24 
Wd6 (my Informator move) or 24 g4! g5 25

At the board it was difficult to weigh up
accurately the consequences of these com­
plications, and in the end I gave preference 
to the consolidating move f2-f4.
I5...1.xe5?
To my surprise, Shirov committed an ob­
vious positional mistake. These alternatives 
were also insufficient: 15...Sc8 16 Bbl Wc7

With time-trouble approaching, to save

After 2 9 ...2 xc3 30 2xh6+ or the more 
resilient 29...2ec8 30 2g3 White also has 
every chance of converting his extra pawn.

Creating a modest escape square for the 
king. The line 30 #b3 Vie4 312g3 was more 
energetic, but the strongest move was 30

And so, I caught ShiTov. We now both had 
6Vi out of 9, with KTamnik and Morozevich 
(who had unexpectedly beaten the worid 
champion with Black) on S'A. Then came the 
last free day, and then the final fouT Tounds.
In the tenth round I drew with Black against 
Piket, after frying unsuccessfully to drag out a 
slightly better rook endgame. Meanwhile, 
Shirov completely outplayed Anand and could 
even have won in one move (32 Be81), but it all 
ended peacefully, after which the leading 
group looked like this: Kasparov and Shirov - 7 
out of 10; Morozevich - 6'A Kramnik and 
Adams - 6; Anand and Ivanchuk - 5'A
In the final rounds the distraught Shirov 
lost to Ivanchuk and Kramnik, with a draw 
against Morozevich. From the press: ‘This 
event, like a mirror, reflected Shirov’s problems: 
the heavy defeat against Kasparov and the 
subsequent poor finish pushed him back 
almost to the middle of the tournament table. ’
However, for me also the finish proved 
difficult. In the 11th round I won a very 
nervy game, full of mistakes by both sides, 
against Timman (this was our last ‘classical’ 
meeting, giving a final score of +20-2=23), 
and I finally took the sole lead, by a margin 
of a whole point. In the remaining games 
with van Wely and Adams I endeavoured to 
keep complete control of the situation, and 
two draws sufficed for first place. And it was 
Anand who burst through to second place. 
After receiving a powerful stimulus from 
Shirov, following his example he defeated 
the same three Dutchmen and as a result 
finished just half a point behind me.
Here is a brief extract from an interview, 
which I gave immediately afterwards in my 
then customary room 207 in the four-star 
Duin Hotel: ‘Before the start I thought that 
‘plus five’ would give first place. I felt that 
the tournament would be too nervy. And 
that was how it turned out: a nervy, big
342

Life after Death
tournament. I played so-so, but the champi­
ons played even worse. On the whole I was 
dissatisfied with my play, but I cannot 
separate it from the situation in the chess 
world and my terrible frame of mind. It is 
very difficult to play normally with such a 
trauma in your heart.’
In a farewell speech at the closing cere­
mony I permitted myself a rather bold 
comment: ‘This tournament has shown that 
there is life after death!’ And with a smile I 
added: ‘However, I am wary of the fact that 
my results in Wijk aan Zee are steadily 
deteriorating: ‘plus seven’, ‘plus six’, ‘plus 
five’... I don’t know what will happen next 
year!’ Alas, before the next tournament I fell 
ill and I never played in Wijk aan Zee again. 
So that this ‘plus five’ turned out to be my 
swan song...
Yuri Vasiliev: 'For three successive years the 
final table at Wijk aan Zee has invariably been 
headed by the strongest piayers in the worid - 
Kasparov, Anand and Kramnik. This was also 
the case in the 2001 tournament, the most 
imposing in its entire history. The name of the 
winner was aiso unchanged: Kasparov. Many 
were hoping that, after iosing the match to 
Kramnik in London in autumn 2000 and 
conceding the worid title to him, Kasparov 
would lose the aura of a super-player, and 
would become an ordinary grandmaster who 
it is possible to beat. This hasn’t happened! His 
hand is still just as strong, his calculation just 
as quick and his eye just as vigilant. The king 
has lost his crown, but not his strength. But 
will this strength be sufficient for him to 
regain the throne?’
Three-Point Margin
Double-Round Super-Toumament in Linares 
(22 February - 6 March 2001): 1. Kasparov -  
7V2 out of 10; 2-6. J.Polgar, Leko, Shirov, 
Karpov and Grischuk - 4Vi.
Before the next Linares it transpired that 
its category would be lowered from 21 to 19, 
since neither of the new ‘chess kings’, who 
had emerged at the end of 2000, would be 
playing: neither Kramnik nor Anand. Before 
the start I made the following comments: 
‘This is a question of responsibility. 
Linares used to be the ‘chess Wimbledon’, 
the most important and most prestigious 
tournament, where the strongest always 
played. Now this won’t be the case. It is 
unfavourable for the new world champions 
to play there; they put there own interests 
first... But there is also another problem with 
Linares: on encountering the refusal of 
Anand and Kramnik, the organisers are 
seeking to replace them on the principle of 
‘resonance’ of names. Everyone knows the 
names of Karpov and Polgar, but, alas, in the 
present-day chess hierarchy these players 
are not rated so highly. It is sad, but there is 
nothing to be done; Linares is Linares, and as 
before I consider it my duty to play there.’
At the start of 2001 Karpov still retained 
part of his once enormous practical 
strength, but he was playing more rarely in 
tournaments higher than category 14-16, 
achieving comparatively modest results. He 
came to Linares for the first time after a six- 
year interval, no doubt with the desire to 
demonstrate something to me and to the 
chess world. True, the nearly 50-year-old ex­
world champion might well be let down by 
his age... Our opponents were the far 
younger Peter Leko, Alexey Shirov, Judit 
Polgar and the 17-year-old debutant Alex­
ander Grischuk, a semi-finalist in the recent 
FIDE knock-out world championship. As had 
been the case since 1998, the grandmasters 
competed in two cycles, and so that no one 
should play three successive games with the 
same colour, the fourth and fifth rounds 
were interchanged.

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
After three days’ play the tournament had 
not produced eitheT leaders, ot outsiders: all 
nine games ended in draws. The start did 
not go well foT me. In the fiTst round with 
Black against Leko I ended up in a difficult 
position (cf. Game N0.67 in Part II of Garry 
Kasparov on Garry Kasparov, note to White’s 
9th move), gave up the exchange and saved 
myself only by a miTacle. In the second 
round I was unable to beat PolgaT with 
White (cf. Game N0.63, note to Black’s 10th 
move), and then in the thiTd round I had 
another Sicilian duel with Shirov (cf. Game 
No.7, note to White's 8th move). AfteT spend­
ing a lot of time in the opening I seized the 
initiative and had the better endgame, but 
in time-tTouble I missed a win. Although in 
this game I already showed some ‘signs of 
consciousness’, on the whole my play did not 
yet herald the final triumph.
The lack of decisive games provoked a 
squall of biting comments in the Spanish 
press. And after the free day, as if we had 
listened to the criticism, the score was finally 
opened. I had Black against a rising staT of 
worid chess - the Muscovite Alexander 
Grischuk. This was our first meeting at the 
boaTd, and my young opponent did not 
conceal his ambitions.

want to deprive him of such a gift.

Forcibly transposing into a roughly equal

more logical, when after 17....&C7 (Stohl) the

Instead of this White initiates play on the

ficiently energetic. I8...h5l was correct, 
immediately beginning to harass the weak

In the meantime Polgar won with White 
against Shirov, so that she and I were lead­
ing the race with 2'h out of 4.
In the fifth round, which concluded the 
first cycle, I had White against Karpov. We 
had not met in ‘classical’ play since Las 
Palmas 1996. This is what Yuri Vasiliev 
reported from the scene of events:
‘That day the tournament hall was unable 
to accommodate all those wanting to watch; 
people were standing in the aisles, and to get 
through to the stage, which was also a scene of 
activity, was extremely difficult There was a 
kind of parade of the top officials of Linares, 
the province ofJaen, and ofAndalucia in gen­
eral. They all wanted to witness the historic, 
166th (!) Kasparov-Karpovgame. You couldn’t 
move for reporters on the stage, while the 
grandmasters sat amongst all this madness.
‘Kasparov concealed a smile with his hand 
and slightly closed his eyes. Karpov was inscru­
table, and this sombre, aloof, impassive face of 
the Great Competitor staggered and drew the 
attention of the Spanish, who know their 
chess. The history of the ancient game has not 
known such a confrontation. Just think: five 
matches for the world championship! They 
have gone through five madly intense 
matches! In each of them there were more 
than 20 games. During one of these matches, 
which lasted nearly six months, in the Land of 
the Soviets there was a change of power, and 
one of the contestants almost died of exhaus­
tion... Karpov-Kasparov: this is a whole epoque 
in chess. And in our life - also an epoque..
‘And here they were sitting before their next, 
166th game, inundated by flashing lights. Just 
like then, back in 1984... And again they were 
ready to uphold their principles. Their views on 
chess. On the struggle. And on life.
‘The smile disappeared from Kasparov's 
face, and he acquired his familiar, slightly 
sinister expression, circulated a countless 
number of times by all conceivable and 
inconceivable publications in the world. But 
Karpov was still impassive. The Alcalde of 
Linares, Juan Fernandez Gutierrez, started the 
clocks, and the great battle began.’
Right from the opening I was able to set 
my opponent serious problems.

Life after Death
Up until then I had played this against the 
Caro-Kann only in simultaneous displays, 
while in serious games I once chose 3 exds 
(Game N0.23), but invariably 3 £id2 (Game 
Nos.8, 48), including against Karpov (Game 
Nos.34, 85 in Part II of Garry Kasparov on 
Garry Kasparov). ‘It became clear that the 
13th world champion had devised some­
thing truly murderous!’ (MakaTychev).
3...-&f5 4 £>c3
The sharpest line, which I had prepared 
for my match with Kramnik (2000). In 
simuls’ I had tried 4 £tf3 e6 5 a3 or 4 c3 e6 5 
.&e3, against Shirov (Game N0.129) and 
Jobava (Rethymnon 2003) - 4 £.e3, and 
against Vallejo (Linares 2003) - 4 £>d2.
4...e6
The usual reply, but after this game for a 
time Karpov turned to 4...1i rb6. To me the 
queen move seems second-rate (since it 
delays Black’s development), although I 
myself played it once, in order to pany 5 g4 
with 5..~&d7 (Velimirovic-Kasparov, Moscow 
Interzonal 1982). However, Black does not 
gain full equality either here, or after the 
quiet 5 £>f3 e6 6 jLe2 £se7 7 0-0 JLg4 (7..&d7 
8 b3 is no better) 8 £sa4 (8 b3 or 8 h3 is also 
suitable) 8...#c7 9 b3 b5 10 £sb2 £>d7 11 c4 
(Grischuk-Karpov, Linares 2001, 7th round) 
or 11 c3!? Sb8 12 £sd3 £>g6 13 a4 (Shirov-
Karpov, Monte Carlo (blindfold) 2001). 
5 g4 ^.g6 6 £>ge2
Threatening h2-h4 and £tf4.
6...£>e7
At that time this was the main continua­
tion - a prophylactic defence of the g6- 
bishop with the aim of retaining a flexible 
pawn chain in the event of the exchange 
£sf4xg6 after h2-h4 and ...h7-h5. 6...h6 7 .&e3 
£sd7 8 Wd2, etc., is too slow. 6...f6 is also not 
very attractive (Game N0.87 in Revolution in 
the 70s). But the most energetic is the im­
mediate attack on the centre by 6...C5!, for 
example:
1) 7 J&.e3 £ k6 (Game N0.88 in Revolution in 
the 70s) or the more modem 7....cxd4 8 £sxd4 
.£±>4! (examples: Motylev-Nisipeanu, Roma­
nia 2001; Shirov-Grischuk, Dubai (rapid) 
2002; Sutovsky-Bologan, Poikovsky 2007);

11 jLg2 <£f8 (Shirov-Topalov, Dresden Olym­
piad 2008), also with double-edged play.
It was because of 6...C5 that the variation 
4 £>c3 e6 5 g4 .&g6 6 £}ge2 declined in 
popularity, but this happened later, and at 
that time, in 2001,1 took an optimistic view 
of the complications resulting here.

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
Later it transpired that 7 f4! is even more 
dangerous for Black, for example; 7...C5 8 
£»g3l (Anand-Karpov, Wijk aan Zee 2003).
7...C5 8 dxc5!?
A seemingly anti-positional move (White 
himself helps the opponent to destroy the 
pawn centre), which a year earlier had been 
tried in the game Shirov-Karpov (Monte Carlo 
(blindfold) 2000). The dynamic nature of the 
resulting positions appealed to me: while 
Black is spending time on regaining the 
pawn, White can hide his king in a compara­
tively safe place and develop an initiative in 
the space vacated, with the hope of creating a 
direct attack on the enemy king.
The following line is quite acceptable for 
Black: 8 h4 cxd4 9 £»bs £>ec6 10 h5 ^.e4 11

the white pieces come into play very quickly:
H...iLe4 12 iLf4 W 6 13 g5 with a powerful

‘This unpretentious move is the whole 
point’ (MakaTychev). While preventing ...jLe4, 
White intensifies the threat of h4-hs and 
prepares We2, which creates a threat to the 
d5-pawn. His initiative is very dangerous, and 
determined measures are required of Black.
10...h5?!
Karpov incautiously repeats his blindfold 
game with 
Shirov. Soon he was to 
strengthen Black’s defence by I0...d4l 11 h5? 
dxc3 12 ^xdS-r 2xd8 13 hxg6 Si7xg6 (Al-

Of course, 11 <Sce2 should be played, and if 
ll-WaS-H 12 <4fl Wxc5, then 13 £sxd4 - I 
reached this position in my preparation for 
the game and I decided that White is not

Black still has to demonstrate equality 
(nevertheless, this was his best chance).

‘Surprisingly, White’s position is so strong

This important game is one of my most 
memorable (it was also rated very highly by 
Judit Polgar). By energetic and consistent 
play I was able to exploit Karpov’s opening 
error (by no means always did this happen), 
and in addition the win made me the sole 
leader after the first cycle: Kasparov - 3Vi 
out of 5; Polgar - 3; Leko and Shirov - 2'/r, 
Karpov - 2; Grischuk - lVi.
I arrived for the sixth round in an elated 
mood and confidently outplayed Leko in a 
complicated Spanish (cf. Came No.2, note to 
Black’s 10th move). This defeat was Peter’s 
only decisive game in the tournament... My 
lead over Polgar increased to a point.
After a free day Judit with White engaged 
me in a real battle for the lead, and on my 
territory - in a Najdorf with castling on 
opposite sides (cf. Came No.122, note to 
Black’s 13th move). She boldly sacrificed a 
pawn, but then suddenly incorrectly ex­
changed bishop for knight (22 jLxe4? dxe4), 
allowed a counter-blow in the centre, and - 
launched a desperate attack!

And a couple of moves later a draw was 
agreed ('A-'A). A fascinating battle and a 
splendid finish!
The following day Shirov surprised me by 
his choice of the Spanish Open Variation, 
resembling the tenth game of my match
with Anand (1995). I was able to exploit an 
inaccuracy by my opponent in a very compli­
cated endgame and to securely blockade the 
enemy passed pawns (cf. Game No.19, note 
to Black’s llth  move), after which the win 
became a matter of technique.
In that same eighth round Karpov gained 
his only win in the tournament - against 
Polgar. This settled matters as regards the 
fight for first place: by reaching ‘plus four’ - 
6 out of 8, I was now two points ahead of 
Judit.
The draw with Karpov in the ninth round 
was our last, 167th ‘classical’ game (cf. Game 
No.47 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988-2009). It 
did not tum out to be the most vivid, but it 
confirmed a pleasant trend for me that had 
long been taking shape: playing White, 
Karpov no longer created problems for me, 
as he had at one time in our matches; more­
over, I increasingly often obtained comfort­
able and rather promising positions with 
Black. This game determined the final score 
of our serious encounters: +28-20=119 in my 
favour, including +7-1=15 in tournaments.
Finally, I beat Grischuk with White in the 
‘anti-Sveshnikov’ variation l  e4 c5 2 £sf3 
£sc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 <£sxd4 £if6 5 <£sc3 e6 6 ^xc6 
bxc6 7 e5 ^d5 8 £se4 jtb7 (8...#c7 is faT 
more often played - Game No.89 in Part II of 
Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov) 9 JLe2l, 
etc. - also one of the variations that we had 
prepared for the match with Kramnik.
The results of Linares 2001 were truly 
paradoxical. This is not often seen: one 
contestant scored ‘plus five’, and the re­
maining five - all ‘minus one’. Regarding 
this, Seirawan joked: 'For the first time in his 
life Kasparov finished last but one!’. By win­
ning my eighth super-toumament in suc­
cession and finishing thee points ahead of 
my pursuers, I once again demonstrated 
that the 2000 London match was by no
354

Life after Death
means the end of my chess career, for which 
many of my colleagues-cum-rivals were 
hoping.
Here are some interesting observations by 
the well-known trainer Anatoly Bykhovsky, 
who was helping Grischuk in the tourna­
ment:
‘Linares 2001 was memorable above all for 
Kasparov’s performance. None of the other 
contestants played with such intensity and 
will-to-win. It is probable that after losing the 
title of world champion Kasparov has ac­
quired an ultra-important objective - to 
demonstrate that he is still the strongest 
chess player on the planet. And in tourna­
ment play he is now superior to everyone. He 
is a maximalist, in contrast to Kramnik and 
Anand, who apparently do not think that 
they should always try and beat everyone. 
But Kasparov aims for this constantly, in 
every game. And in Linares he played not 
simply for first place, but for the optimum 
result.
'Kasparov’s attitude to the game was al­
ready apparent from, for example - lunch. 
The other contestants spent at least an hour 
on it, talking among themselves and with 
their trainers. But Kasparov lunched very 
quickly and did not allow himself to be 
distracted at all before a game. The behav­
iour of Yuri Dokhoian was also an indication 
of Garry's frame of mind. The other trainers 
strolled about, chatted or drank coffee, but 
Dokhoian and Klara Shagenovna (who has 
been at all the tournaments in Linares, since 
she considers this to be one of the most 
important events for her son) sat in the hall 
and without distraction followed the play of 
their ‘protege’. In general, Kasparov's attitude 
to his own performance provoked admiration 
- although a Linares ‘old-timer’, he played 
here as though for the first time.
‘Naturally, the relations between Kasparov
and Karpov drew attention... The two 'Ks' 
have different aims: Kasparov wants to 
demonstrate (and for this he has every basis) 
that he is still the strongest player in the 
world, whereas Karpov simply wants to play 
chess and maintain his high reputation... But 
they have more things in common. They have 
both been world champion, and both speak 
out against the innovations of FIDE and 
llyumzhinov in the fields of rapid chess and 
the world championship. Karpov and Kas­
parov want to defend classical chess; to some 
extent nothing divides the ‘veterans' - they 
have no fundamental disagreements. When 
they shook hands before a game, played, and 
analysed it after the finish, one sensed their 
benevolent attitude to each other’.
The highly uneasy situation, which had 
developed by that time in the chess world, 
induced the champions of different eras to 
display solidarity. Roughly a month after 
Linares, Karpov, Kramnik and I published a 
joint ‘Appeal to the chess society’ - a decla­
ration in defence of classical chess, tradi­
tional tournaments and matches for the 
world championship (cf. Kasparov vs. Karpov 
1988-2009). The efforts of the champions, 
augmented by the activity of Bessel Kok and 
Yasser Seirawan, led within a year to an 
illusory compromise with the FIDE Board...
Fall of the Berlin Wall
Double-Round Tournament in Astana (19 
May -1 June 2001): 1. Kasparov - 7 out of 10; 
2. Kramnik - 6'/i; 3. Gelfand - 5V2:4-5. Shirov 
and Morozevich - 4V2: 6. Sadvakasov - 2.
Soon after Linares I gave rapid chess its 
due: in Cannes I won the FIDE World Cup (cf. 
p.488), and a month later in Zurich I finished 
second in a tournament to mark Korchnoi’s 
70th birthday. On the whole I played confi­
dently - I won my group (4V2 out of 5), easily
355

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
beat Korchnoi (1V2-V2) and Short (1V2-V2), but 
in the final I once more ran into Kramnik 
(V2-1V2): with White I was again unable to 
breach the ‘Berlin Wall’, while with Black I 
obtained a good game and could even have 
repeated moves, but I suddenly lost control 
over myself and over the situation.
Kramnik gained a new lease of life after his 
comparative failure in Wijk aan Zee, and the 
next round of rivalry between the 13th and 
14th world champions acquired particular 
importance - this was the category 20 May 
super-toumament in Astana, the new capital 
of Kazakhstan (which for me replaced Sara­
jevo). The day before the start we gave a joint 
press conference, which created enormous 
interest. And in general at this ‘tournament 
of six’ there was an unusually large number 
of spectators, including young players.
The line-up was also not altogether usual. 
To the two 2800 favourites and three 2700 
fighters was added the local 2500 hero, the 
22-year-old Darmen Sadvakasov (on the 
other hand, his trainer was none other than 
Yuri Razuvaev!). It was this debutant who 
nearly spoiled the final picture for me, by 
twice losing to Kramnik (with White in an 
equal endgame, and with Black by blunder­
ing on the 14th move) and gaining two 
draws with me, in both of which I had to 
suffer...
In the first round I beat Shirov with Black 
in a comparatively rare line of the 
Scheveningen (cf. Game No.99, note to 
White’s 8th move) - this good win gave me 
an additional charge of optimism. In the 
second round against Gelfand I employed a 
novelty in the French Defence, which had 
been prepared for the match with Kramnik, 
and I held a definite initiative, but to be on 
the safe side Boris gave up his queen (which 
was not essential) and set up a fortress - a 
draw on the 41st move. But Kramnik, by
beating Gelfand and Sadvakasov, started 
with 2 out of 2.
The next day I had Black against the un­
predictable Alexander Morozevich.

nor 13 a3, nor 13 Sfel, nor 13 £lce2 prom­

Gradually I realised that it was not so

while his dark-squared bishop stands on e5 
like a rock (Grandmaster Gufeld would have

26.. .#c5 27 b3 axb3 28 axb3 (28 £xb5? .£±>5)

27 
axb3 ^.c6 28 ^g3 was correct (cf. 
above). Sasha did not want to allow the 
activation of the a8-rook, but he allowed the 
activation of the d7-bishop. ‘The unjustified 
discarding of material makes White’s posi­
tion very dismal’ (Morozevich).
27.. .1.b5 28 £)f4!?
‘This has its drawbacks, but it is not a de­
cisive mistake. After the game in a joint 
analysis we both criticised this move, think­
ing that White should simply have made an 
escape square - 28 h3 ‘with only a small 
advantage for Black’. But it is far from clear 
what White should do in reply to 28...2g8! 
(threatening ...g6-g5; if 28...ihxe4 White 
equalises by 29 2xf7+i &xf7 30 Wh7+ - G.K.) 
29 #g5 2h8 30 2df3 (30 fog3? &c3l - G.K.)
30.. .2h5 31 #d2 g5l, and White has no

Instead of 31 #d2?, correct is 31 2xf6

*c6 35 2c8+ *b6 36 2b8+! *a5 37 2a8+

drawing chances. Therefore instead of
29.. .2h8 my Informator 29...&b2\ is more 
accurate, with a clear positional advantage.
28...£xf4?
With a time scramble approaching I de­
cided to exchange one of the opponent’s 
attacking pieces, to exclude tactical strokes 
such as 28...2g8?! 29 ^.xe6! fxe6 (29...#xc2

Black’s chances are slightly better.

For some reason, neither I nor my oppo­
nent noticed the simple possibility 28..JLxd3!, 
immediately regaining the exchange with an 
obvious advantage:
1) 29 £)xd3?! Wd4 30 £sxe5 Wxe5 31 #e3 
g5 and wins, or 30Wh4 Wxe4 31 Wxe4 £>xe4 
32 ®xb4 £c3 33 £sd3 2h8 34 2f3 £.d4, and 
White has an extremely difficult endgame;
2) 29 cxd3 Wd4 (threatening ...Sg8 and 
...g6-g5; Stohl called this position ‘roughly 
equal’!) 30 &c4 (30 Wg5 Sc8) 30...g5! 31

&xe6 Sa7 34 Wxg5 <4^7! and ...<4^6 - Black’s 
extra piece is superior to the pawns.

All the endings - 30 Wxe5?! dxe5 and 
,..^.xd3 or 30 2xd6?! Wxf4 31 2xf4 ^xd6 32 
2xf6 2a7! - are in Black’s favour. Therefore 
the most logical was 30 Wf2 2h8 31 h3 or
30.. .g5, and now 31 Wb6(?) 2h8 32 h3 
(Morozevich) is dangerous in view of
32.. .£>d7! 33 Wf2 2h7 with the intention of 
,.JLxd3 and ...g5-g4, and my Informator 31 
a4 bxa3! is too troublesome, but the cool- 
headed 31 'A’gl! maintains dynamic equal­
ity.

ending deserved consideration: 30...Wxf4!?

‘Although Kasparov never had the reputa­
tion of being a great lover of the endgame, 
nevertheless 1 did not consider my position 
to be so bad that I should exchange on e5

White is still far from being lost: 33 2e3 f5 
34 2cel iLc6 35 'A’gl, etc.
My Informator recommendation 31 Wd2 
is more accurate, for example: 3l .2h8 (not

In time-trouble I decided to repeat moves.
32.. .5.8(?!), which I gave in Informator, runs 
into 33 -&C4! -&xc4 34 lt7 +  2d7 35 ^xc4 
®xe4 36 4gl! (Morozevich), when White is 
okay. But 32..JLxd3 33 cxd3 (33 1137+?! £\d7 
34 cxd3 Sd8) 33-2h8! (Stohl) would have 
condemned him to a difficult defence.
33 Wf2 ' f6 34 Wb6 2h8?!
Again missing 34..JLxd3 35 cxd3 Sh81.
35 2xd6?
‘A bad oversight in not the most compli­
cated position, which spoils a very interest­
ing game. And yet to calculate the saving 
variation, despite having only two minutes 
left, was not difficult: 35 lc7+! £sd7 36 
2xd6! (a sacrifice within the bounds of my 
tactical vision) 36...2xh3+ (after 36...1rxe4 37

may have problems) 37 gxh3 l rxe4+ 38 ‘A’gl!

perpetual check (39...1rg3+), or unclear play

again the extra exchange proves the only 
but sufficient argument’ (Morozevich). 
3 5 ..M x d 6 36 #xd6+?!
Now the position stabilises. The non­
trivial 36 #xb5 gxh3 37 g4! was more resil­
ient, for example: 37...1d4! (not 37...1rd2 
because of 38 Wc5+! 4d8 39 I'gl) 38 H>7+ 
£sd7 39 ^.a4! (39 c3?! is weak in view of

and ... 2xd7 with winning chances, ‘but 
despite everything, White can still somehow 
fight on’ (Morozevich).
36...&xd6 37 Sxf6 2h7!
For an instant White has an extra pawn, 
but he faces insoluble problems. Black picks 
up the e4-pawn, creating a mobile passed 
pawn or even a pair of connected passed 
pawns. Meanwhile, the b4-pawn holds two 
of White’s pawns, and he does not manage 
to create counterplay.

fia3 0-1
This fighting win enabled me to catch 
Kramnik - we now both had I'/i. out of 3. 
The next day in the rearranged fourth round
came the duel of the leaders. For the first 
time since the tragic second game of the 
2000 match I risked repeating the Griinfeld 
Defence against Kramnik - and I confidently 
gained a draw in a crucial set-up (Game 
No.70 in Revolution in the 70s). My peace of 
mind in this important part of the battle­
field was restored.
But in the fifth round I suffered a misfor­
tune: I was unable to beat Sadvakasov with 
White. After playing a variation of the Eng­
lish Opening, well known from the second 
game of my 1987 match with Karpov, I 
ended up in a dubious position (cf. Game 
No.29 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1986-87, note 
to White’s 10th move), and although I then 
gained the initiative, this was not enough 
for a win - a draw on the 43rd move.
Meanwhile, my main rival won against 
Morozevich and was leading the race after 
the first cycle: Kramnik - 4 out of 5; Kasparov 
- 3V2. However, the next day I breached 
Shirov’s French Defence (cf. Game No.lO, 
note to White’s 10th move) and again 
caught the leader - we both had 4I/2 out of 6.
In the next three rounds Kramnik beat 
Sadvakasov and scored two draws, while I 
had to be satisfied with half-points: with 
Black against Gelfand in a Griinfeld, with 
White against Morozevich in his sideline of 
the Slav Defence (cf. Game No.62, note to 
Black’s 7th move), and with Black against 
Sadvakasov. This was a terrible game: I tried 
very hard to seize the initiative, and ob­
tained an interesting, promising position, 
but I went wrong and in the end I nearly lost.
Although I was terribly vexed at being 
unable to beat Sadvakasov and catch Kram­
nik, the tournament arbiter Vladimir Dvork­
ovich later saw that this had its plus points: 
‘Had the leaders been equal before the last 
round, their game might not have been the 
main event of the tournament! It is quite
363

probable that they would have agreed to 
share the last point and victory in the tour­
nament, as happened at Linares 2000. Now, 
however, there could not be a share of first 
place, but victory for Kasparov would enable 
him to become the sole winner. Winning 'to 
order’ is doubly difficult, but possible; 13 
years earlier Garry managed to beat Karpov 
in the 24th game of the match in Seville and 
to retain the title of world champion. The 
number '13’also operated in Astana...’
And so, before the finish Kramnik was on 
6^/2 out of 9, I had 6, and I was due to play 
the leader with White. I had to compose 
myself for a decisive battle.

what he had prepared for our 2000 match

(Sadvakasov-Kramnik, 2nd round).
Of course, I could also have played 3 d4, 
but I didn’t want to avoid the Spanish be­
cause of the Berlin Defence! I considered 
myself obliged to go in for its main variation 
and demonstrate that in it Black did not 
have easy equality. During the six months I 
had already accumulated many ideas here.
3...^f6
I sensed that Kramnik would again erect 
the ‘Berlin Wall’: at that time he constantly 
played this not only against me, but also 
against Leko, Shirov and others.

It would appear that Black has an inferior 
version of the Spanish Exchange Variation: 
apart from the pawn minority on the king- 
side (usually in the Exchange Variation this 
is fully compensated by the two bishops), his 
king, unable to castle, hinders the coordina­
tion of his pieces, and the e5-pawn cramps 
his position (in the Exchange Variation he 
usually plays ...f7-f6). But, on the other hand, 
with his pawn on e5 White’s control of the 
light squares is weakened, and also after the 
exchange of queens the intensity of the 
battle is reduced. And with accurate play 
Black hopes gradually to solve his problems. 
He even does not especially value the two 
bishops, often exchanging the dark-squared 
one, when the ‘unopposed’ light-squared 
one is sufficient for him.
The position is still a middlegame without 
the queens, but there is a great risk that the 
play will quickly simplify and become too 
tedious, not allowing any scope for flights of 
fantasy.
9...h6
Kramnik used to skilfully vary the differ­
ent branches of the Berlin, making it hard 
for me to prepare. Here the computer is 
useless: everywhere the play is viscous and

non-forcing, with a variety of possible plans. 
Because of the frequent change of scene it is 
not easy for White to formalise the position 
and find the most effective method of 
converting his pawn majority on the king- 
side. In the 2000 London match I experi­
enced great problems with this, but later I at 
least began making natural moves.
Our dispute began with 9..~&d7, for ex­
ample: 10 bB h6 (later Kramnik also success­
fully played 10...&C8!? 11 .&b2 JLe7) 11 -&b2 
<&c8 12 hB (12 Sadi b6! 13 £se2 c5, 3rd 
match game, London 2000) I 2...b6 13 Sadi

Sdl &c8 11 £>g5 i.e 8 12 £sge4 b6 13 h3 
&b7 14 g4 £se7 (Zurich (rapid) 2001). Inci­
dentally, the idea of moving the black king to 
c8 and b7 was upheld long ago by Lasker, 
and in the mid-1970s by Romanishin.
But in Wijk aan Zee 2001, 9...^e8 (the tra­
ditional plan) was unexpectedly ‘detonated’: 
10 h3 .&e7 (according to Kramnik, he had 
prepared this for the 15th game of our 2000 
match), although after l l  ^.g5l? .&xg5 12 
£sxg5 h6 13 £sge4 b6 14 Sfdl £se7 (I4...<&e7! 
is better, Anand-Kramnik, Leon (advanced

aged to gain a minimal advantage (cf. Game 
No.73).
10 h3
When I first encountered 9...h6 I chose 10

i.e 6 13 g4 £se7 14 £sd4 £sd5 15 £>ce2 ^.c5 
with equality (9th match game, London 
2000). As it transpired, with the black king 
on e8 the set-up with ^.f4 and Sadi is 
preferable, so that in case of necessity the 
bishop can comfortably return to cl.
10.. .^.d7 (here also 10...^>e8 disconcerted 
me: 11 £se4 c5 12 c3 b6 13 Bel i.e 6 14 g4

£sf4 (Anand-Nakamura, London 2010), in 
both cases with some initiative. This was our 
very detailed preparation!
12 &b2 Sd8
The idea of Black’s new plan is to ex­
change one pair of rooks on the d-file. The 
main drawback to this plan is that the black 
king remains in the centre, and White must 
try to exploit this factor as quickly as possi­
ble.
13 S a d i £se7
An important manoeuvre: the knight 
switches to g6 and hinders the advance of 
White’s kingside pawns. In similar positions 
the first to begin playing this was Zoltan 
Almasi (1995), and the evaluation of the 
Berlin Defence as being unpromising for 
Black gradually changed.

ble problems:
1) 17..JLc8?! 18 £>f6+! 4e7 19 £sh4! (an­
other difficult move!) 19...g6 20 £id7l Sxd7 
(20..JLxd7 21 ,&xh8, and 21...f6? is bad in 
view of 22 £ixg6+ 4f7 23 £ixf8 £ixf8 24 Sd2 
and Sedl, winning) 21 Sxd7+ .&xd7 22 
,&xh8 winning the exchange (again 22...f6? 
23 £>xg6+ 4f7 24 £ixf8 £ixf8 25 Sdl is bad 
for Black), or 19...Sxdl 20 £>f5+ 4d8 21

£ixf6 2f8 24 £ixd6 gxf6 25 £>f5+ and .&b2 
with an overwhelming advantage;
2) 17...Sc8 18 £sh4! (this is what neither of 
the players saw; if 18 ,&f6? only I8...gxf6! 19 
£ixf6+ 4e7 20 <S^xd7 2d8 would have saved 
Black, but not my earlier I8...2a8(?) on account 
of 19 JLe5l) 18...C5 (the best defence against 
the threat of f2-f4-f5: I8..£h7? 19 f4 &e7 20 
£if5 .&f8 21 £ifg3! and wins) 19 f4 jLc6 20 f5 
,&e7 21 £>f3 f6 22 fxe6 fxe5 23 £>xe5, and Black 
has a very difficult position, for example:
23...2f8 24 £ixc6 bxc6 25 g4 2d8 26 2xd8+ 
.&xd8 27 2dl with the threat of 2d7.
But at the board 17 £>d4 also seemed dan­
gerous for Black: it is not immediately clear 
what he should play.
17...C5?!
This move took Kramnik nearly three- 
quarters of an hour, after which he had just 
18 minutes left for 23 moves. There are 
indeed very many possibilities in the posi­
tion, and a mistake is possible at every step:
1) 17....&C8? 18 £ixe6! (18 £if6+ gxf6 19 
£ixe6 2xdl 20 £ig7+ 4d7 21 2xdl+ Ji.d6 is 
not so clear, although it was this variation 
that Kramnik feared most of all) l8...2xdl 19

this is more forceful than my earlier 22 2d8 
jLf5 23 ^d2 jLxc2, although even here after 
24 4fl! and ,&d6 Black will not have full 
compensation for the exchange) 22...f6

(24...g5 25 £>f5) 25 Se8 ,&g7 26 2e6 g5 27 
£if5 .&f8 28 Se8 and wins;
2) 17...Sh7! (if 17-Sg8 there is 18 Sd3 
with the idea of Sg3 and £if6+!) 18 f4! c5! 19 
£sf3 4c6?l 20 Sbl!, defending the bishop in 
the variation 20..JLxe4 (20..JLe7? 21 f5 £id4 
22 f6!) 21 2xe4 g6 22 g4 .&g7? 23 f5 and 
wins. 22...Sd5?! is also insufficient: 23 c4 
2d3 24 4f2! (my earlier 24 £iel is slower on 
account of 24...Sd2! - Wedberg) 24...4d8 
(24...h5 25 4e2l) 25 .&f6+ 4c8 26 f5 with 
pressure. It is better to play 22...4d7 23 
£ie5+ 4c8 24 £sxg6 - White regains the 
pawn, but his advantage may not be suffi­
cient for a win (I reached this position in my 
calculations during the game). But the main 
thing is that instead of 19...Ac6, Black could 
play 19.-f5! 20 £ ic3 i.e7 or 20 £sg3 .&c8!, 
calmly panying the threats.
With the move in the game Black drives 
the white knight to f5, so that f2-f4-f5 is not 
threatened. But now he acquires other 
problems.
18 £>f5 2h7
The only move: 19 £ixg7+ was threatened, 
and if I8...2g8 there is 19 £ixh6.

19 .&f6! (played with great pleasure)
19...Sc8?
A mistake, which was not noticed by any 
of the commentators. 19...Sa8!, moving the 
rook away from possible attacks, was more 
resilient, although even here after 20 f4 £lc6 
21 ^.h4l with the threat of £sfg3 and f4-f5 
White has excellent play for the pawn.
20 JLxg7?
Over-hasty. A cruel trick was played on me 
by my preceding game with Sadvakasov, 
where in a complicated position with a time 
scramble I did not capture a pawn on a5 and 
in the end I lost all winning chances. There­
fore I was impatient to restore material 
equality.
20 f4! ^.c6 21 £sfg3! was significantly
stronger - this was the move that Kramnik 
was most afraid of. Black has a difficult 
choice:

White.
‘Moves such as 20 f4 are in Kasparov’s

arisen by force, one where he has real

after which I was intending 26 4Ti2l) 26

Continuing to fight for an advantage - an

especially unpleasant in the opponent’s 
time-trouble. Black would easily have gained 
a draw in the event of 26 i f l  <£ixg2 or 26

White would have continued to trust in his 
extra pawn on the kingside.
27 £lg4 Sd5l
The correct idea - centralizing the rook. In 
the variation 27...h5 28 £se3 White has a 
small but stable plus. ‘I could have held this 
inferior endgame, undoubtedly with draw­
ing chances. But I had 10 minutes left to the 
time control, and I needed to make several 
accurate moves which were difficult to find. 
Therefore I decided to force events. Unfortu­
nately, Black’s play did not ‘knit well’ tempo- 
wise, and I became rattled...’ (Kramnik).
28 2el+!
Also the correct move. In the knight end­
game White has no advantage: 28 Sxd5

Blundering a piece: in time-trouble Black

course, Kramnik did not want to resign 
prematurely.

For all its imperfections, this was a very 
precious game: not only a win in a decisive 
encounter, enabling me to overtake a very 
dangerous rival and take first place (in a 
ninth successive tournament!), but also my 
first win against Kramnik after the ‘blank’ 
score in the 2000 match (the overall balance 
of our meetings in ‘classical’ play was now 
+4-5=40), as well as the winning of a crucial 
opening dispute - the fall of the ‘Berlin Wall’!
Soon afterwards I said in an interview that 
my win in Astana ‘not so much buries the 
entire qualifying cycle, about which Kramnik 
is constantly talking, but makes it completely 
pointless in the eyes of the world community, 
including the eyes of sponsors’. It was pre­
cisely then that I was phoned from America 
by a potential sponsor of world champion­
ships, who was supporting my junior chess 
projects, and he asked: ‘Well, is it time to put 
together money for a return match?’.
I began thinking and speaking about this 
immediately after the 2000 London match. 
But I remember our team doctor Alexander 
Polkhovsky looking sadly at me and asking: 
‘After playing a whole match with Kramnik, 
do you not realise who you are dealing with?’ 
Indeed, if Kramnik had resembled Euwe in 
something other than his height, after my 
three tournament victories in 2001 the 
question of a return match would have been 
decided automatically. During Euwe’s time 
the concept of ‘reputation’ was not an empty 
phrase!
Why I did not include in the London con­
tract an item about a return match is some­
thing that is hard to explain, based on the 
logic of Kramnik or Anand, who have always 
been concerned in the first instance about 
their own well-being. But whereas Anand did 
this openly, Kramnik, as has happened many 
times in history, tried hypocritically to cam­
ouflage his personal benefit ‘with the inter­
ests of chess’.
After becoming the challenger and the 
champion without any qualifying process 
(and after before that losing all the qualifying 
cycles in his career), Kramnik promptly de­
clared: 7 went in for this in order to restore the 
qualifying system... The question is about the 
system itself. To a large extent it is of no sig­
nificance who is the strongest. In his time 
Fischer was obviously superior to the remain­
ing candidates. But this did not mean that he 
should have been freed from having to qualify. 
It is a completely natural situation: if you are 
strongest, then you should in fact win the 
qualifying tournament. I understand Kas­
parov’s enormous desire to play a match for 
the world championship, but, I have to admit, I 
don't see the logic in his words... Is he alto­
gether for’ or ‘against’ qualification? I person­
ally think that there should be qualification! 
And he? I should like to hear from him a clear 
and unambiguous reply to this crucial ques­
tion.’
My reply was not only ‘clear and unambi­
guous’, but also quite exhaustive:
‘When I won the title of world champion I 
was the No.l on the rating list, and I regularly 
won matches against Karpov and all the 
tournaments in which I took part, but new 
victories continued to be demanded of me. 
Confirmation was constantly demanded of 
me, and this is probably normal. In the chaos 
of the current situation only one fact can 
remain undisputable: the world champion

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
should be the strongest player on the planet. 
The London match gave Kramnik the title, but 
he needs to confirm it with victories. The 
champion had the possibility of doing this in 
Wijk aan Zee and Astana. The outcome is 
known...
‘My position has always been very simple: 
if there is a sound qualifying system, the 
automatic right to a return match is an 
incorrect idea. Now I am zealously fighting for 
my right to a return match because I am 
winning all the tournaments in which I take 
part - including those where Kramnik plays. 
He does not now need to seek a new oppo­
nent.
‘It would be very good to create a new 
qualifying system. But for the system to be 
legitimate, one must be sure that the world 
champion is the strongest player on the 
planet. If Kramnik wins a second match 
against me, there will no longer be any 
questions. If he loses, then, although the 
outcome of the London match was right, a 
conclusive change will not yet have occurred.’
After properly restoring my strength at the 
traditional summer training session by the 
sea, I ‘chalked up’ 11 out of 12 in a Europe 
against Asia rapidplay match (Batumi, 17-19 
September 2001), won S'A-2Vi in a double­
round clock simultaneous against the Czech 
national team (Prague, 18-20 October 2001), 
and played quite well in the Botvinnik Memo­
rial - a short match with Kramnik in three 
forms of chess (Moscow, 30 November - 9 
December 2001).
Initially in memory of Mikhail Botvinnik it 
was planned to stage a four-cycle match- 
tournament with three of his pupils - Karpov, 
Kasparov and Kramnik. However, Karpov 
suddenly withdrew, but arrived for the start 
of the FIDE knock-out championship, which 
began three days earlier in Moscow. Since he 
went out in the very first round, chess fans in
the foyer joked: ah, what a pity that Karpov 
withdrew from the match-tournament of the 
three ‘Ks’ - he would still have been in time.
When there were just the two of us left, 
Kramnik insisted on reducing the number of 
classical games to four, so that the match 
should not have too much importance. Our 
chess triathlon began with a draw in ‘classi­
cal’ play (2-2), and in rapidplay (3-3), and 
concluded in victory for me in blitz (6V2-3V2). 
After Astana I played quite successfully 
against my main opponent and did not lose 
to him again in ‘classical’ play. The burden of 
responsibility which pressed on me in the 
2000 match had obviously been lifted.
Who is the Real King?
Double-Round Super-Tournament in Linares 
(22 February -10 March 2002): 1. Kasparov -  
8 out of 12; 2. Ponomariov - 6V2; 3-5. Ivan­
chuk, Anand and Adams - 6; 6. Vallejo - 5; 7. 
Shirov - 4V2.
On this occasion the background to 
Linares was provided not by the preceding 
tournament in Wijk aan Zee (of the Linares 
players, only Adams took part there), but the 
recent FIDE knock-out world championship, 
which produced several sensations. Anand 
was relieved of his title after losing in the 
semi-final to Ivanchuk, who, in turn, unex­
pectedly lost in the final to a rising start of 
Ukrainian chess, the 18-year-old Ruslan 
Ponomariov. The new FIDE champion, who 
strongly resembled Kamsky and Karpov in 
their youth, played freshly and energetically 
- in the preceding rounds he knocked out 
Morozevich, Bareev and Svidler!
Now Ponomariov was making his debut in 
a category 20 super-tournament, and in a 
battle with five of the top ten in the world 
rating list he was eager to demonstrate that 
his success in the knock-out was no accident.
372

Life after Death
The other Linares debutant was 19-year-old 
‘2600’ player Francisco Vallejo - at that time 
the strongest native Spanish Grandmaster.
'Notable by his absence is Vladimir Kram­
nik, whose serious plans for this year would 
appear to be limited only to a match in 
October with the computer Deep Fritz’, wrote 
the Ukrainian journalist Nikolai Fuzik. 
'Vladimir will also have to miss his favourite 
traditional July tournament in Dortmund, 
since on this occasion it will have the status of 
a candidates event, the winner of which will 
earn the right to a match with Kramnik for 
the historic’ version of the world champion­
ship title. But even without him Linares 2002 
promises to be exceptionally interesting. For 
Kasparov, who has not found his niche in 
either of the world championship systems, 
there only remain tournaments in which to 
demonstrate who is the real king in the 
kingdom, regarding which the other partici­
pants may have their own opinion.’
Of course, I was psychologically depressed 
by the absence of any real prospect of playing 
a match for the world championship, and 
initially I was nervous (however, that was the 
case in the majority of similar tournaments). I 
started, like the year before, with three draws. 
In the first round I was unable to beat Vallejo 
with Black, although for a long time 1 had an 
excellent position, and after my opponent’s 
time-trouble blunder 40 Wc2? I could have 
won with 40...^xf5l. But, alas, I took the 
wrong pawn, and White managed to escape. I 
was terribly vexed: surely I wasn’t going to be 
struck by the ‘Sadvakasov syndrome’?
In the second round I was free, then in the 
third I played Vishy Anand and engaged him 
in a complicated, viscous struggle in a 
Paulsen Sicilian. I gained some advantage, 
but in the time scramble a parade of mutual 
mistakes began, and after the time control I 
missed a wonderful chance.

The two missed wins were a pity, but I 
had to move on. The next day I played an­
other viscous game - with Ivanchuk, which 
ended in a draw on the 34th move.
In the fifth round, which took place after a 
general free day, I met Michael Adams, the 
only player who at that moment was on a 
plus score - 2 out of 3.

The green light to this variation was given 
by the 4lst game of the Karpov-Kasparov 
match (1984/85). Today this is played auto­
matically and, as they rattle off these well- 
known moves, players sometimes do not 
even suspect that back in early 1985 for a 
participant in a world championship match 
it was a problem to find a worthy reply to 9

even 13...Wd6 (J.Polgar-Karpov, Hoogeveen
2003).

14...Sfe8
And here is Adams’s novelty - instead of 
the premature 14...iLf6 (15 iLf4, Kasparov- 
Dao Thien Hai, Batumi (rapid) 2001; Kas- 
parov-Kasimdzhanov, Linares 2005), or the 
timid l4...Wd6 (15 a4, Sutovsky-Schandorff, 
Esbjerg 2001). We also looked at 14.2ad8?! 
15 iLf4, forcing 15~.Wa5, since if 15~.Wd7 
there is the unpleasant 16 ji.b5, while after 
15-iLd6 16 c4 We4 Black runs into 17 iLg5! 
Sd7 18 M l Wg4 19 h3 Wh5 20 d5.
15 ii.f4 Sac8
The position after this move, which is 
considered the strongest, has become a 
tabiya. 15.~ji.d6 is weaker (here the bishop 
prevents the pressure on the d4-pawn), in 
view of 16 c4 We4 17 -&e3 Sad8 18 5a2! 
(Game N0.51 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988- 
2009).
16 c4
Later White tried a good dozen moves 
here - including 16 iLd3 Wd7 17 Sbl (Leko- 
Anand, 
Linares 
2003; 
Kasparov-Anand, 
Linares 2005), 16 h3 (Kramnik-Anand, Wijk 
aan Zee 2003; Kasparov-Motylev, Moscow
2004), and 16 £sd2 (Adams-Kramnik, Wijk 
aan Zee 2005), etc. However, at the time this 
was all still unusual.
16.. .We4 17 i.e3 ilf6
The fashion for a rapid c3-c4 fell sharply 
after 17...Wc2! (Leko-Kramnik, 3rd match 
game, Brissago 2004). We also looked at the 
queen move, but for some reason we con­
sidered it insufficient.
18 Sa2
Black would have been set far more prob­
lems by the alternative 18 Sell, as I later 
played in a rapid game against Karpov 
(Game No.49 in Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988- 
2009). But I very much wanted to switch the 
rook to the centre, following the example of 
the old game Karpov-Portisch (Lucerne 
Olympiad 1982).
18.. .b6
This move, made after a long think, was 
one that I awarded an exclamation mark to 
in Informator, judging that White was better 
after l8...2cd8 19 Sd2 (19 d5 £>e5 is equal, 
Grischuk-Huzman, Rethymnon 2003). But 
here also after I9...h6 Black has quite a solid 
position: 20 h3 We7 21 c5 £>a5 or 21 d5 £>a5 
22 £d3 Wd7, etc.
The ...b7-b6 idea has a good positional 
basis. Black’s main problem is the vulnerable 
position of his queen, and he needs to solve 
it somehow, without allowing a break­
through by White’s central pawns. Overlook­
ing the radical solution 17-Wc2!, Adams 
found another possibility: place the knight 
on a5, where it will be defended by the b6- 
pawn, and if necessary retreat the queen to 
b7.

Carry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
19 hB
Realizing that too little was promised by 
19 Sd2 £ia5 20 jk.d3 #g4, after lengthy 
hesitation I decided to begin a pawn offen­
sive away from my king!
19.. .£>a5 20 g4
When in the tournament table you have 
nothing but draws, advances such as g2-g4- 
g5 demand a certain courage. But if White 
does not drive back the powerful black 
bishops and create at least some slight 
pressure, he will simply have nothing to 
hope for.
20.. JLg6
My activity markedly perturbed Adams, 
but he made the best move, placing his 
bishop close to his king. 20...JLxg4? 21 hxg4 
#xg4+ 22 <4+11 was incorrect, while if
20.. .jLd7?!, then 21 Jtd3 was strong, for 
example: 21...#b7 22 g5 Jtd8 (22..JLe7? 23 
£ie5 and wins) 23

c5(c6) 28 Sae2 with an overwhelming 
advantage for White.
21 g5 Ae7 22 <5ie5 (the black queen is still in 
danger) 22..JLd6!
Again best! 22...#b7? is weak in view of 23 
ik,g4 Scd8 24 Af4! (but not my Informator 24 
#a4(?) because of 24...iLd6) 24..~&d6 25 Sae2, 
and White develops powerful pressure.

Now is the time! Nothing was given by 23 
JLd3 #h4 24 £>xg6 hxg6 25 #g4 #xg4+ 26 
hxg4 ^-f4! with equality (Svidler-Gelfand,

^.g4 ^.xe5! 25 .&xc8 5xc8 26 dxe5 #xh3 27 
Sd2 h5 or 27...£ic6 with a pawn for the 
exchange and excellent counterplay.
23.. .hxg6 24 C5!
It seemed to me that White was about to 
seize the initiative. If 24 iLg4 both the quiet
24.. .flcd8 25 #a4 Af8 and the gambit line
24.. A xc4 25 ^.xc8 Sxc8 were satisfactory.
24.. .6.8!
And again the best move: Black has a solid 
defence! I spent a long time calculating the 
variation 24-bxc5 25 dxc5 ^.f4?! (25-.&f8!) 
26 &g4 2cd8 (26...Sb8 27 Sae2!) 27 Sd2

25 i.g4 Scd8 26 Sae2 #d5
In the Anand-Adams game from the 13th 
round there followed 26...#c6! 27 cxb6(?l) 
with a draw, although after 27...cxb6! the 
advantage is now with Black. Equality would 
have been retained by 27 #c2 bxc5 28 dxc5

#xa3 32 Hxc7 ± cS 33 ie61.
27 Jcf4! Sxe2 28 #xe2
28.. .C6?
Nevertheless my pawn offensive dis­
turbed Adams’s composure: for a long time 
he found the correct defence, but at the 
board this was not easy to do, and in the end 
he cracked under the pressure. The move in 
the game looks natural - the pawn moves 
away from an attack, but now the situation 
suddenly changes sharply and Black encoun­
ters insoluble problems.
The capture of the d4-pawn also had to be 
calculated: 28...<5}c6? 29 jLxc7 £>xd4 30 #e4! 
#xg5 (30...bxc5 31 .&xd8 #xd8 32 h4 or
30.. .#xe4 31 2xe4 Sd5 32 cxb6 axb6 33 
jLxb6 is no better) 31 .&xd8 #xd8 32 c6! f5

30 ,&d6! ,&xd6 31 cxd6 2xd6 32 #e8+ <&h7

<&g2 2xe3 38 #xe3 £>c6 39 #e4 £>e7 40 a4, 
and White has a technically won ending.
However, 
after 
the 
accurate 
reply
28...#c6! Black would have maintained the 
balance: 29 #e5 (29 ±f3 #d7) 29...bxc5 30 
dxc5 &xc5 31 #xc7 #b6! with the threat of 
..Jtxf2+ or ,.JLxa3. Although White has two 
active bishops, there are too few pawns on 
the board, and also the ‘bad’ knight on a5 
quickly comes into play.
291x7 2a8
Necessary, since after 29...#xg5? 30 l.xd8 
#xd8 31 #e8 or 29...#xd4? 30 lxd8 #xd8 
31 cxb6 axb6 32 h4 there is no compensa­
tion for the exchange.
30#e5?
Alas, I was lured by a pretty false trail, not 
noticing its refutation. 30 #a6! was correct, 
forcing 30...#c4 (I was afraid of 30...#xd4(?) 
31 cxb6 lc 5  and I underestimated the 
simple 32 #xa5 #xf2+ 33 ^ h l lxb6 34

31 #xc4 <5^xc4, after which White has two

choice, especially on the threshold of time- 
trouble.

This first win in the tournament enabled 
me, with Vh out of 4, to replace Adams as 
the only player on a plus score.
In the sixth round I had my first encounter 
with Ruslan Ponomariov, and against my 
Najdorf he employed the sharp English Attack 
(cf. Game No.17, note to White’s 12th move). 
By the 2lst move a roughly equal endgame 
was reached with rooks and opposite- 
coloured bishops. From the press: 'Possibly the 
most unexpected moment for Kasparov came 
when in an obviously drawn position his 
young opponent decided to fight for some­
thing more. "He’s playing for a win?!” they 
exclaimed in surprise in the press centre.’
On the 31st move Ponomariov suddenly 
gave up his g5-pawn for the a5-pawn, 
allowing me to create a dangerous pair of 
connected passed pawns, and in the time 
scramble he overstepped the mark and 
ended up in a lost position.

A third missed win, and in an important 
game! The next day I chose against Shirov l 
e4 c5 2 £)f3 £)c6 3 .&b5 (since I was psycho­
logically not prepared for the Sveshnikov 
Variation), played unconvincingly and did 
not achieve anything - a draw on the 26th 
move. But nevertheless I ended the first cycle 
as the leader: Kasparov - 3'A out of 6; Po- 
nomariov, Ivanchuk, Adams, Vallejo and 
Shirov - 3; Anand - 2Vi.
At the start of the second cycle I neverthe­
less won with White against Vallejo, al­
though I again played unconvincingly: I had 
a considerable advantage, but then I gave up 
a pawn without gaining any particular 
compensation for it. However, in time- 
trouble the young grandmaster went wrong, 
and his game went downhill. The lead over 
my pursuers grew to a full point.
In the ninth round I was free, and behind 
me Ponomariov led the chase by beating 
Adams. In the tenth round, in which it was 
Ruslan who was free, I had Black against 
Anand and I seized the initiative in a sharp 
branch of the Najdorf (cf. Game No.93, note 
to White’s 9th move), but by some miracle 
my opponent held out - a draw on the 40th 
move. It need hardly be said how happy 
Vishy was-. foT the first time afteT out 1995 
match he did not lose to me in Linares!
Then I made two further Sicilian draws: 
with White against Ivanchuk and with Black 
against Adams. And two rounds before the 
finish I was caught by Ponomariov: we both
had 6 out of 10, with our closest pursuers on 
just 50%. Thus my second duel with the new 
FIDE champion became the decisive game of 
the tournament.

Possibly my opponent had prepared for 6

jLd3 c5 10 #62!? cxd411 #e4 g6 12 0-0-0, as 
I played against Anand (2nd match game

furt (rapid) 2000), or 6 JLd3 £>xe4 7 ^.xe4 
£sf6 8 jLg5 #d6 9 £d3!? #b4+ 10 £d2 #xb2 
110-0 with quite good compensation for the 
pawn (Kasparov-Anand, 3rd match game 
(blitz), Reykjavik 2000). But under the influ­
ence of Adams I had taken a fancy to a 
different plan.
6.. .£sxf6 7 c3
A rare and fresh move (Dokhoian and I al­
ways looked for such continuations!), which 
from 2002 became popular. The classical line

Life after Death
is 7 ^.d3 c5 (Maroczy-Rubinstein, Karlsbad 
1907) or 7...b6 (Teichmann-Rubinstein, Bad 
Pistyan 1912). If 7 .&C4 Black plays 7...£.e7,
7.. .C5, or even 7 .a6 and ...c7-c5 (Ivanchuk- 
Anand, 1st match game, Moscow 2001). And 
after 7 £>e5, in contrast to that which oc­
curred in the game, 7...£>d7 is suitable (Reti- 
Mieses, Gothenburg 1920).
7.. .C5
A delay in the attack on the centre -
7.. .^.e7 and ...0-0 broadens White’s options. 8 9
8 £>e5l?
An attempt to improve on the variation 8 
&e3 1Brc7 (8...cxd4 9 ^.xd4 is less good) 9 £>e5 
a6 10 Wa4+ £>d7, which was tested in the 
sixth round game Adams-Anand. In it after 
11 0-0-0 cxd4 12 £>xd7 Wxd7?! White could 
have gained an advantage by 13 Was!, but
12.. JLxd7! 13 ®xd4 ^.c6 with equality is 
more accurate. Black is also not too afraid of 
11 £b5 cxd4 12 i.xd7+ £xd7 13 Wxd4 £b5 
14 a4 ^.d6 15 ^xf7 &xf7 16 axb5 axb5 (an 
example: Ponomariov-Akobian, 2nd match 
game, Khanty-Mansiysk 2009).
8.. .£>d7?
The rare variation disconcerted Ruslan, 
and he immediately made a mistake. If
8.. JLe7(d6) or 8...cxd4 there is the unpleas­
ant 9 ^.b5+ ^.d7 10 £>xd7. If 8...'Brc7 - again
9 -&b5+ (Topalov-Milov, Prague (rapid) 2002)
or 9 ^.f4 ^.d6 10 ^.b5+. White is also better 
after S.-WaS?! 9 WbS! (again threatening 
jLb5+) 9-.a6 10 £>c4 1^7 11 ^ 6  (Doring- 
Grabliauskas, Litomysl 1996).
Therefore correct is 8...a6l, when 9 £t.e3 
Wc7 leads to an unclear position from the 
previous note (9 ^.g5Wc7 is no better), while, 
as became clear a few days later, the end­
game after 9 # a 4+ S-d7 10 £>xd7 fixd7 11 
1Brxd7+ &xd7 12 dxc5 ^.xc5 is almost drawn 
(Kasimdzhanov-Dorfman, Bundesliga 2002). 
9£b5!
This is the point: the pin on the knight 
combined with the threat of fif3 puts Black 
in a difficult position. Here Ponomariov 
realised that he had gone wrong some­
where, and he sank into thought...
9.. 
.£d6
Already the only move. It is bad to play
9.. .a6? 10 1^3 I ,e7(f6) 11 £xd7+ and 1 ^ 7 , 
or 9 .cxd4? 10 1^3 W e7 (I0...f6? 11 IT15+;

A strong move, although 10 jLf4! is also 
promising (10 jLe3 0-0 or 10 0-0 a6!? 11 
jLxd7+ ^.xd7, Mellado Trivino-Bofill Mas, 
Spain 1990, is not so clear).

‘True to his attacking manneT, Kasparov 
goes in for a pawn sacrifice, hoping in

(Zaitsev). However, here I spent too much 
time studying the tempting alternatives:
1)

Black cannot hold out. But as it is, his posi­

15.. .1.xg5

variation 15...4e7?! 16 f4 a6 17 f5! with a
decisive attack: 17...axb5? 18 fxe6 WeS 19

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
19.. .a6! 20 fih3 (20 JLa4 b5 with equality)
20.. M e7
20..Jtd7l is more elegant, when no ad­
vantage is promised by 21 ii.c4 Sag8 22 Sdl 
b5l (instead of the Informator 22...Sg7(?l) 23 
Shd3) or 21 JLe2 Sad8 22 Sdl 1^5, while 21 
jtxd7 Hrxd7 221i rxh7+ leads to an equal rook 
ending.
21 JLd3 f5
At this moment I realised to my distress 
that White now merely had decent compen­
sation for the pawn. Black is about to com­
plete the development of his queenside, and 
therefore the safest thing would have been 
to force a draw by 22 'Srxh7+. But I developed 
an irresistible desire to ruffle the opponent’s 
forces - it was a pity to part with such a 
promising attacking position!
22 g4!?
This risky move, made on the threshold of 
a time scramble, unsettled Ponomariov. Up 
until now the young champion had de­
fended confidently, but here he began to be 
overcome by doubts, and he gradually lost 
the thread of the game.
22...#f6 (the immediate 22...b5l? was more 
subtle, and only if 23 S el - 23...1Srf6 with 
double-edged play) 23 fidl!
The appearance of the rook on the d-file 
creates certain problems for Black.
23.. .b5
23...fxg4?! 24 Sg3 e5? 25 .&C4+ 4>e8 is 
suicidal in view of 26 Sgd3l (this is even 
better than the Informator 26 2d5). But to 
maintain equality 23...g5 24 #h5+ #g6 25 
gxf5 l^hS 26 Sxh5 exf5 27 h4 (27 Sxg5 
JLe6! - Stohl) 27...<4>g6 28 Sxg5 4>f6 or 27 f4 
Ji.e6 28 fxg5 Bad8 is quite sufficient.
24 JLe2 e5
It would appear that Ruslan was already 
imagining he had winning chances - other­
wise he could have restricted himself to one 
of two more modest continuations:
1) 24-Sa7 (with the idea of ...Sd7) 25 
#xh7+ (if 25 Shd3, then the equalizing
25.. .g5 26 ®15+ 4^7 27 gxf5 h61? 28 fxe6

ariov - 6, Ivanchuk, Anand and Adams - S’A
In the last round Ponomariov drew with 
Anand, after accurately performing the 
Marshall Attack. I had Black against Alexey 
Shirov. Before this the score of our decisive 
games in ‘classical’ play was 13-0 in my 
favour, and Shirov fearlessly launched into a 
tactical fight, having apparently decided

with the aid of some cabbalistic computa­

tures should come to an end.

An indication of Shirov’s determined 
mood: he captured on f6 quite firmly and 
quickly, although up to 2000 he used to 
prefer the quieter 9 £id5 (Game Nos.ll, 13, 
49,104).

When I played 10...f5,1 was almost certain 
that in reply Shirov would capture with his 
bishop on b5: he had already played this, 
and with success.

A piece sacrifice rich in chances, which 
periodically causes Black problems. The 
typical plans - either 11 jLd3 .&e6 12 c3, 12 
Whs or 12 0-0, or 11 c3 .&g7 (if ll...fxe4?l the

Axfs 13 £>c2 and £ice3 - were very familiar 
to both players.
11.. .axb5 12 £ixb5
After picking up two pawns, White is 
threatening a check at c7, against which 
there is no normal defence - only to give up 
material.

A counter-attacking idea of the Moscow 
master Sergey Gorelov. Initially 12...Sa7 13

showed that White’s chances were better 
after both 14 exf5 (Vitolins) and 14 c3 - say,
14...£>b5?l 15 a4! (stronger than 15 exf5 ®c7

13 b4
Another sacrifice, this time of a pawn, 
with the aim of cutting off the aggressive 
rook or opening lines on the queenside, 
where the black king is hoping to hide. This 
dramatic move, which has been known since 
1979, was also employed by Shirov’s compa­
triot, the Latvian master Alvis Vitolins - a 
great lover of unfathomable complications, 
which in the pre-computer era did not lend 
themselves to accurate assessment even in 
home analysis.
The source game Levchenkov-Gorelov 
(Jurmala 1977) went 13 £sbc7+ *d7 14

£>e7 16 #xf7 * c6 17 c4 Wd7 18 £ a 8! £>g6! 
with dynamic equality (Game No.18 in 
Revolution in the 70s). The 13 b4 thrust was 
an attempt to breath new life into the 11 
JLxbS gambit.
A fresh idea of McShane’s, which, it is 
true, signifies a rejection by Black of at­
tempts to refute the piece sacrifice in the
opening and an agreement to a quick draw. 
Of course, one would like to capture the b4- 
pawn, but with what?

It appeared that this risky idea was 
knocked down by the ‘advanced chess’ game 
Shirov-Topalov (Leon 2001): 16 c3l? (being 
two bishops down, White does not immedi­
ately capture the queen!) I6...2xe4 (lS-Wby

Jakubiec, Griesheim 2002).
But the most popular line is 15-2g8!? 16

in the 21st century, 17...Vixc7 18 cxb4 fxe4 or

However, all the questions in the 
controversial variations with 13-2xb4 had 
been far from resolved when the move
13.. .'irh4 appeared on the scene.
14 0-0 2g8
Here, after little thought, Shirov confi­
dently pushed forward his f-pawn.
15 f4l?
A novelty! In the event of 15 c3 f4! a draw 
results from both 16 H,xa4 (16 i ’hl? 2g6!)

IT14 or 17...1,g5 18 g3 fxg3 19 hxg3 1^4 
with the transparent aim of .J5xg3+.
The ambitious 15 f4 looks threatening: 
White prevents ...f5-f4 and opens up the 
position (if I5...exf4? 16 c3 Black is in trouble). 
At any event, my deliberations over the 
resulting position took me about an hour (my 
opponent was burning with impatience!). 
Initially, to be honest, I was horrified: all 
around there appeared to be terrible threats. 
However, Black has an extra piece, and this 
must be exploited in some way! Gradually I 
calmed down, and literally by the method of 
elimination I found a worthy reply.
15...&d8!
It is curious that the computer immedi­
ately suggests this move, not an easy one for 
a human to find. Black needs to coordinate 
his pieces, defend against the impending 
checks and other attacks (for example, 16 
c3), and it turns out that the best place for 
his king is on d8! It is now White who has a 
difficult choice.
16 c3
As was planned. True, a move later Shirov 
not only fails to gain an initiative compen­
sating for the piece, but he himself comes 
under a swift attack. But did he have any­
thing more cheerful? We will discard the 
reckless 16 £ixd6? ,&xd6 17 £ib6 £id4! 18

Threatening to clear the long light-

deep trance. It would appear that at that 
moment he sensed that the history of our 
bloodshed would not be restricted to the

That was how my record three-year senes 
of ten ‘classical’ tournament victories con­
cluded. ‘Kasparov once again steam-rollered 
his way through Linares’, wrote David Lyada 
in the 64 magazine. 'By a margin of one and 
a half points he won his fourth successive 
Andalucian trophy and decisively demon­
strated who in the chess world is still ‘number 
one’. There is no disputing both his superior­
ity in the current Linares, and the fact that 
Garry has won 13 of the last 15 super- 
tournaments. Today only the elusive Kramnik 
remains a dangerous opponent for him.’
Immediately afteT the tournament I 
stated in an interview that KTamnik was 
concerned only about his own interests and 
was neglecting his obligations to the chess 
world:
‘The champion's title had a sacred mean­
ing only because it belonged to the strongest 
player. It is ridiculous when Kramnik talks 
about some ‘official’ title, match ot qualifi­
cation. His unwillingness to play a return 
match has led to a devaluation of the tradi­
tional title, since today KTamnik is not the 
strongest playeT. He had no otheT way of 
demonstrating that he is the strongest, 
other than to play anotheT match with me...
‘Unfortunately, Kramnik has done every­
thing he can to avoid the most dangerous 
opponents, and not only me. (In the Candi­
dates Tournament held in July 2002 I did not 
participate, and neither did Anand, Ponom- 
ariov or Ivanchuk - G.K.). It is staggering that 
Anand and Kramnik did not want to play a 
match against each otheT. On becoming 
champions, they could have come to an 
agreement, but they preferred to Tetain theiT 
split achievements and not place them 
undeT threat.'
Last Olympiad Triumph
35th World Chess Olympiad (Bled, 25 Octo­
ber - 10 November 2002): l. Russia - 38V2 
out of 56; 2. Hungary - 37'A; 3. Armenia - 
35; 4. Georgia - 34; 5-12. China, Holland, 
England, Slovakia, Israel, Yugoslavia, Mace­
donia and Switzerland - 33V2, etc. (alto­
gether - 134 teams). The winning team 
comprised Kasparov (71/2 out of 9), Grischuk 
(7 out of 11), Khalifman (7 out of 9), Moro- 
zevich (7 out of 11), reserves SvidJer (6 out of 
9) and Rublevsky (4 out of 7).
By early 2002 the London firm ‘Brain 
Games’, which had staged my match with 
Vladimir KTamnik, was on the verge of 
bankruptcy and in February it sold the rights 
to staging the next world championship to 
the ‘Einstein Group’ financial company. 
Foreseeing serious problems in attracting 
majoT sponsors ‘undeT Kramnik’, the well- 
known American grandmaster Yasser Seba- 
wan suggested a plan for uniting the world 
championships undeT the aegis of FIDE. This 
idea was supported by me, by Bessel Kok, 
and at the last moment also by Kramnik.
I spent the whole of March and April on 
setting up this new concept of unification, 
assuming that I had no other chance of 
playing a match for the worid champion­
ship: all the illusions with TegaTd to Kramnik
392

Life after Death
had already been dispelled. At the cost of 
enormous nervous expenditure a compro­
mise with the FIDE board was reached.
On the eve of these seemingly historic 
decisions Bessel Kok arranged an excellent 
rapidplay knock-out tournament for the 
Eurotel Trophy (Prague, 29 April - 5 May 
2002). After beating Milos (2-0) and J.Polgar 
(2-0), in the quarter-finals I lost a fierce 
battle to Ivanchuk (1-1; 1-1; O-l), and he lost 
in the semi-final to Anand. The other finalist 
was Karpov, who beat Short, Kramnik, 
Morozevich and Shirov! But in the final 
Anand defeated Karpov, gaining mini­
revenge against him for Lausanne 1998.
On 6th May 2002 the FIDE President Kir- 
san llyumzhinov, together with the 13th and 
14th champions, Kok and Seirawan, signed 
the famous Prague Agreement - ‘Resolution 
on the Unification of the Chess World’. From 
then on FIDE became the sole custodian of 
the World Chess Championship title and the 
only organization staging official world 
championships. But at the same time it was 
obliged to become a management organiza­
tion, to set up a precise schedule which 
would satisfy potential sponsors (essentially 
this was an attempt to carry over into the 
2lst century the positive experience of the 
GMA and PCA), and to approve a unification 
plan, according to which the FIDE champion 
Ponomariov had to play a match with the 
leader of the world rating list Kasparov, the 
‘historic’ champion Kramnik with the win­
ner of the ‘Einstein Group' candidates tour­
nament, and the winners of these two 
matches were to meet in a unifying match 
for the world championship.
The agreement admitted that ‘the unifica­
tion plan is not perfect and will not satisfy 
everyone’. Indeed, soon 22 grandmasters, 
including Anand, Shirov, Leko, Lautier, Yusu- 
pov and almost the entire Russian team,
expressed in an open letter: ‘our concern 
about the violation of sports principles’ and 
called on all parties to ‘resolve the injustice’, 
since 'there are better ways of reunification'. 
Possibly there were indeed other ways, but 
the letter was signed by people who con­
ceived the unification process in completely 
different ways, and it looked like an attempt 
to hinder this process.
At a press conference devoted to the 
opening of a stage of the FIDE Rapidplay 
Grand Prix (Moscow, 1-5 June 2002), I stated: 
‘Many of those who have signed this letter 
do not want any unification at all. Since it 
demands not only sacrifices, but also joint 
energetic work. Without the securing of a 
five-year calendar, and in particular money 
for 2003, we will not get anywhere. The 
enormous work which is now being carried 
out needs the support of grandmasters, and 
notits torpedoing!’
On this occasion I managed to concen­
trate on playing and I won this rapid knock­
out tournament, beating Ehlvest, Lautier 
(both 2-0), Grischuk (1V2-V2), Khalifman (l-l; 
1V2-V2) and, in the final, Radjabov (lyi-’/i). 
‘My immediate plans are associated with the 
world championship. I also intend to play for 
Russia in the Olympiad’, I stated at the 
concluding press conference. ‘But in general 
the year will be dominated by rapid chess: 
unfortunately, there are now no ‘classical’ 
tournaments left...’
Meanwhile, Kramnik’s friends, in confor­
mity with his aim of not playing a return 
match with me, organised a ‘qualifying 
cycle’, which now became part of the unifi­
cation plan. The ‘Einstein Group’ Candidates 
Tournament (Dortmund, 6-21 July 2002) was 
memorable for the absence of four favour­
ites, the participation of the ‘2600’ player 
Lutz and the ridiculous format. The eight 
grandmasters were divided into two double­
553

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
round mini-groups, the top two players from 
each played semi-final mini-matches of four 
games, and the winners met in a final mini­
match. Success went to Peter Leko, who 
finished second in his group, but then beat 
Shirov and Topalov.
All these months I continued my involve­
ment in organizational work, and I held 
endless discussions, on which masses of 
energy were spent. Already then it became 
clear that all FIDE’s plans were ‘up in the air’. 
This hectic regime led to a disaster for me in 
the rapid match Russia vs. Rest of the World 
(Moscow, 8-11 September 2002). In each 
team there were ten players, who played 
each of the other team members on the 
Scheveningen system, and I scored just 4 out 
of 10! An unprecedented failure and with a 
nightmarish quality of play! Kramnik also 
did not distinguish himself (4 out of 9), and 
the Russian team lost 48-52.
After this serious failure I very much 
wanted to rehabilitate myself at the 2002 
Olympiad which began six weeks later in the 
Slovenian town of Bled, where unforgettable 
triumphs were achieved in their time by 
Alekhine (1931) and Tal (1961). Kramnik 
declined to play for the team - evidently he 
realised that, with my much higher rating, I 
was not going to concede board 1 to him.
On this occasion the Russian team did not 
have any great problems: nearly all played 
well, but especially Khalifman and I. At the 
start we crushed Costa Rica and Belarus (both 
3 V2-V2) - by tradition I did not play in the first 
round, but in the second I opened my account 
with a win. Here is what our team trainer 
Naum Rashkovsky wrote about this: 'Garry 
defeated Aleksandrov in simply classical style: 
his opponent did not even understand what 
had happened, with what strength of player 
he had encountered! He lost without a whim­
per, without making a single move that at
least somehow would have sharpened the 
play. After this game Kasparov was full of self- 
confidence. We all also breathed an obvious 
sign of relief, since in a team much depends on 
the form of the leader...'
In the third and fourth rounds we confi­
dently defeated India and Georgia (both 3-1), 
and I won, correspondingly, against Sasiki- 
ran and Mchedlishvili. 3 out of 3! In a diffi­
cult fifth round match with Armenia (2-2), I 
drew with Black against Akopian. Then 
without me Russia crushed Bosnia and 
Herzegovina - again S’/z-Vz!
After scoring 18V2 out of 24 we were lead­
ing the race by a margin of three points over 
our closest pursuers - the Hungarians. And 
it was they who proved to be our main rivals. 
We only needed to slow up slightly in 
matches with Poland (3-1; I beat Krasenkow) 
and Holland [2V2-1V2), for Hungary to win 
twice 3V2-V2 and reduce the deficit to one 
and a half points. And in the ninth round the 
Hungarians also beat us - 2Vi-lVi.
Playing Black against Leko (cf. Game 
No.93, note to White’s 9th move), I gradually 
gained the initiative, and had an enormous 
lead on the clock and a somewhat better 
endgame, but... With the score standing at 
1-1 Svidler suddenly made an incredible 
blunder of a pawn and lost, and I, on seeing 
this, became nervous, rushed things and 
first lost all my winning chances, and then 
blundered into a two-move fork. Fortu­
nately, in desperate time-trouble Leko 
missed a win, and two moves later we 
agreed a draw.
And so, Russia - 251/2 out of 36, Hungary - 
25. The battle for Olympiad ‘gold’ intensi­
fied! In the tenth round I won a tense Sicilian 
duel against Ye Jiangchuan, taking my score 
to 6 out of 7, while our team beat China (3-1) 
and increased the lead over the Hungarians 
to a point.

Life after Death
The destiny of first place was decided by 
the eleventh round, in which Hungary were 
paired against England and Russia against 
Germany. My opponent was the 31-year-old 
champion of the country Christopher Lutz, an 
outsider in the recent Candidates Tourna­
ment. Before this I had beaten him in Horgen 
(1994), and earlier in a simul’ against the 
West German national team (Came No.103), 
but Olympiad encounters are distinguished 
by their completely special intensity.

22 h3?!
An indecisive and unnecessary move, 
which takes away the h3-square from the

there could have followed 22...£sd5 23

24.. ~&d7 25 C4) 25 e5 iid7 with a roughly

balanced by the weakness of the c3-pawn. On 
the other hand, White would have retained a 
perfectly comfortable and safe position.
22.. .1.e8 23 Sfcl
Openly playing for equality. In the event

more complicated play.
23.. .^d5! 24 y$xe7 (avoiding the unclear 24

24.. .£sxe7
Lutz was apparently confident that a 
draw was not far off. I also thought that the 
endgame was equal. But nevertheless the 
black bishop is more mobile than the knight, 
and the a5-pawn may become weak.

On general grounds White centralises his 
king. Nothing good was promised by 25 g4

‘The critical moment in the game. Now

29...J.b5
The bishop breaks out into the open. The 
white knight on b6 looks well placed, but it is 
ineffective, and it is hard even to imagine 
where it will end up.

unattractive, but nevertheless this was the 
lesser evil.
30.. .5xe5 31 £lf4 £id4?!
I rejected the sharp 3l...g5?! because of 32

pressurizing 3l.-J.c6!?, blocking the c-file.

This shocked Lutz. ‘With one move Black 
unexpectedly contrives to attack all the 
white pieces: neither of the knights on c8 
and f4 nor the rook on fl feels safe, and 
neither does the king on gl - it comes under 
check from e2!’ (Dokhoian).

Sadly necessary: White loses after both 35

35...&d7

when the knight endgame is difficult for 
White. But I very much wanted to cut off the

cisive 36...g5! (White’s downfall is caused by 
his errant knight) 37 Sc4 gxf4 38 flxd4 2a8

36.. .h5
It was simpler to send the knight after the 
a5-pawn - 36...£sb3!? 37 £sb6 ,&e6. But I had 
the idea of creating an unusual attack on 
the king with a small force.
37®b6
A difficult choice. 37 <A>h2 was dangerous:
37.. .£sb3 38 £sb6 JLe6 39 Sf2 (after 39 Sel 
which I gave in Informator, 39...'4>f7 and

In time-trouble White blunders. The last

which there are two tempting options:
39.. .1.xd3 40 £sxd6 Be6 41 S d l Bxd6 42

42 ^ h l Se6 (with the threat of ...Bh6+) 0-1 
‘A splendid example of domination play’
(Dokhoian).
This was my last, 50th win in Olympiads. 
Russia crushed Germany (3V2-V2), whereas 
Hungary beat England only by the minimum 
margin and three rounds before the finish 
they were now trailing us by two points.
In the 12th round we maintained the 
margin by beating Croatia (2V2-1V2). The 
13th round matches Russia-lsrael and 
Hungary-Armenia and the 14th round 
match Russia-Yugoslavia quickly ended in 
draws. My draw with Gelfand (cf. Came 
No.82, note to Black’s 9th move) produced 
the final score in our ‘classical’ meetings 
(+8=8) and also a pleasing result: by scoring 
7V2 out of 9 (+6=3), I stepped on to the 
Olympiad podium as the possessor of the 
highest performance (2933).
‘I can say that I was very happy to hold the 
gold medal in my hand. This is already the 
sixth victory for Russia in Olympiads and my
eighth’, I said at a concluding press confer­
ence in Bled. I made four appearances for 
the USSR and four for Russia, including six 
times on board 1, with an overall score of 
+50-3=29. After 2002 I did not play in the 
Olympiads, and in them Russia did not finish 
first for more than a decade...
The sham FIDE presidential elections, 
which took place at the Congress in Bled, 
were a pure formality: the Kirsan llyumzhi- 
nov team remained in charge. With the 
benefit of hindsight, I have to admit that 
Bessel Kok and I made a serious mistake, by 
going along with Seirawan’s tempting 
unification plan and concluding peace with 
llyumzhinov. It should have been foreseen 
that this plan would collapse, and a battle 
should have been begun for a change in the 
FIDE leadership. Kok should undoubtedly 
have been put forward for the post of presi­
dent: in 2002 llyumzhinov was weakened 
(his power base in Kalmykia had become 
shaky), and Bessel would have had excellent 
chances of winning. The 2006 attempt, alas, 
was too late...
Despite the Olympiad triumph, to some 
extent the departing year marked the end of 
my period of domination in the chess arena. 
This was confirmed in an exhibition match 
of four rapid Kasparov-Karpov games (New 
York, 19-20 December 2002), which I unex­
pectedly lost 1V2-2V2 (cf. Kasparov vs. Karpov 
1988-2009, 
Game 
Nos.48- 51), faltering 
under the burden of numerous problems. In 
particular, I was unnerved and kept in 
suspense by the unclear situation regarding 
my forthcoming match with the computer 
program Deep Junior. It was twice post­
poned, and it was only just before the start 
of the first game that llyumzhinov informed 
me by telephone that within a month the 
encounter with the machine would never­
theless take place.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
Borderline Condition
Double-Round Tournament in Linares (21 
February - 9 March 2003): 1-2. Kramnik and 
Leko - 7 out of 12; 3-4. Kasparov and Anand 
- 6V2; 5. Ponomariov - 5V2; 6. Vallejo - 5; 7- 
Radjabov - 4V2.
Linares 2003 saw the meeting of all the 
participants in the expected Ponomariov- 
Kasparov and Kramnik-Leko matches, as well 
as Anand - the N0.3 in the world rating list 
and the winner of Wijk aan Zee 2003. 
Somewhat apart from this ensemble were 
two ‘2600’ players: the local representative 
Vallejo and the 15-year-old debutant Tei- 
mour Radjabov - the hope of Azerbaijan 
chess. And much depended on which of the 
favourites would score the most points 
against the outsiders.
I hardly prepared for this category 20 su­
per-tournament, which I played just two 
weeks after my ultra-tense New York match 
with the computer program Deep Junior (3- 
3) and experienced clear signs of nervous 
exhaustion.
David Lyada: ‘The anxiety for Kasparov be­
gan with the drawing of lots, when it tran­
spired that in the first round he would have 
Black against Kramnik. And the latter, figura­
tively speaking, is a kind ofthom in Kasparov’s 
flesh. And whereas before the drawing of lots 
Garry was very sociable and amiable, after it 
his face changed. Suddenly he became very 
serious, then he proceeded silently out of the 
Cervantes Theatre (where the opening cere­
mony took place) to the Hanibal Hotel, and, 
after giving his apologies, did not even show 
up for the ceremonial dinner. He went off to 
prepare for the game, and his mother asked 
for a meal to be brought to his room. The 
stellar duel between Kramnik and Kasparov 
turned out to be short... '
We continued our duel in the Queen’s
Gambit Accepted, begun more than two 
years earlier (1st match game (rapid), Mos­
cow 2001), and in a complicated, roughly 
equal position on the 18th move Kramnik 
offered a draw, which I accepted with alacrity.
In the second round I had White against 
Radjabov and, of course, I was not contem­
plating any result other than a win. I gained 
some advantage in a French Defence (cf. 
Game No.10, note to Black’s 7th move), but 
the position remained rather complicated. 
The critical moment arrived on move 21.

piece coordination - I overlooked that the
queen on d5 was defending the rook on hi. 
And after thinking here for nearly 15 min­
utes, for some reason I decided that 24 ^ 4  
would also win.
24...g5!
The point: I missed the fact that 25 .&xg5? 
was not possible because of 25...Sdg8. Now, 
for the first time, the position becomes 
sharper. Radjabov judged it to be already in 
Black’s favour, but this is probably going too 
far: it would be more accurate to say that 
the position is dynamically balanced.

29.. .!fg6 with the deadly threat of ...H)l+. 
After a desperate but hopeless resistance, 
White failed to make his 40th move and lost 
on time (O-l).
A terrible defeat, which ruined the entire 
tournament for me. The press labelled the 
game 'a surprise, which will go down in chess 
history’. And, indeed, I had not lost in Linares 
for 62 games (since my defeat against Ivan­
chuk in 1997), it was even longer since I had 
lost with White (since my defeat against 
Kramnik in Dos Hermanas 1996 - Game 
No.27), and in general I had never lost to such 
a young opponent. I was very indignant when 
at the end of the tournament the ‘experts’ 
awarded the brilliancy prize to this game 
(with such terrible blunders!), but I neverthe­
less congratulated Radjabov himself.
The day after this severe shock I decided 
to engage Peter Leko in a real battle. I delib­
erately chose a sharp and very dangerous 
variation of the Sicilian (cf. Game No.17, note 
to White's 12th move), came under an attack 
- and the risk proved justified. For almost 40 
moves Leko persistently attacked, but in a 
terrible time scramble he faltered, allowed
the powerful stroke 38...2xb3+! and suffered 
the loss of material.

At the end of the game an unpleasant 
incident occurred. I had five minutes left, 
Leko had ten seconds, and he decided to 
claim a draw in view of the three-fold repeti­
tion of the position. But he did this incor­
rectly: with me to move he suddenly stopped 
the clocks and appealed to me and the 
arbiters, stating, moreover, that Black was 
tTying to win on time (as if he had not done 
this with Kramnik in an endgame with rook 
against bishop, 10th match game (rapid), 
Budapest 2001). My opponent’s behaviour 
made me terribly angTy, but in the end the 
arbiters calmed things down and recorded 
the draw. A little later Peter apologised to 
me - apparently his trainer and father-in- 
law Arshak Petrosian had had a few words 
with him...
Lyada: 'Kasparov again left the stage in a 
very bad mood. In the end did this waste of 
energy affect his performance in the tourna­
ment?’
In the fourth round I was free, then there 
was a general free day, and in the fifth 
round came a crucial duel with Ruslan 
Ponomariov. The FIDE champion had started 
with l  out of 4, so there was no way back for 
either of us. In our preparations for this
‘white’ game, for a long time Dokhoian and I 
were unable to decide what to play on this 
important occasion.

10 cxd5 exd5 11 i-f4 -S^xcB
A slightly premature exchange. As has

typical ll...£>a6 followed by ...c7-c5 is more 
flexible.
12 bxc3!
It would appear that Ruslan underesti­
mated this reply, expecting 12 Sxc3 c5. The 
capture with the pawn changes the charac­
ter of the play: now c3-c4 or e2-e4 is on the 
agenda, and ...c7-c5 is no longer so effective.
12.. .£>a6?!
And this is already a mistake: with the 
white pawns on c3 and d4, the black knight 
is in danger of being stranded on the edge of 
the board. However, easy equality was not

‘The most energetic: with one move 
White is able simultaneously to include 
several of his pieces in the play. The pro­
posed arena of battle is the centre and the 
kingside, and the knight on a6 requires too 
much time to reach there.’ (Dokhoian).
13.. .dxe4?!
This exchange aggravates Black's difficul­
ties, but it was not an easy choice. After
13.. .C5 there were several tem pting options:
14 e5,14 2 el and 14 exd5 #xd5 (l4..Jtxd5

Here I again stopped to think, deciding 
where to move my queen - to fl, g4 or h5. 
For the moment White is a pawn down, but 
he is effectively playing with an extra knight. 
20#g4
‘In view of the impending lack of time for 
thought, White’s decision must be deemed 
practical, to say the least: his following 
moves are understandable and clear’ (Dok­

is weaker on account of 20...£sc5! 21 2f5 
#xa2 22 2xg5+ ^ 8  23 »f6 (Stohl) 23...2e6! 
24 #g7+ &e7, when Black still holds on.
Objectively the most forceful winning 
move was 20 #h5!? with the threat of 
£)f3xg5, and if 20...2xc3 21 2xc3 ®xd4+, 
then 22 2f2! Wxc3 23 1^7+  *h8 24 *67! 
with an irresistible attack: 24-Sg8 25 ^e4 
or 24—Wg7 25 Sf7 #d4+ 26 *hl! - the 
triumph of White’s strategy! However, in 
this case I would have had to find the only 
moves, whereas 20 Vtg4 leaves White a 
comfortable choice.

With time-tTouble approaching I began 
playing unconvincingly, and the game was 
prolonged. The moves came to me with 
great difficulty: there was the pressure of 
the tournament situation, and I was afraid 
of squandering my advantage... On seeing 
the 28 a3 resource (cf. the note to Black’s 
23rd move), I did not think for long. Mean­
while the attack 22 Scfl! would have been 
immediately decisive, for example: 22...1Brxc3
23 Sxf7 VHe3+ (23...Sg6 24 1M) 24 * h l or

After 24-Me4 the most effective is 25

27 Scfl, breaking through to the f7 point, 
since if 27~.1Bre8(e7) White mates by 28 Slf4

Black tries to save himself in an endgame

<&h8 30 Sg7. If 27...1re4, then 28 £sf5 is also

Or 35 2h6l. By now I had calmed down: 
White wins with the advance of his pawns.

40 g5 £>e8 41 4e5 Sd7 42 4e6 Sf7 43 2f6 
£ixf6
And without waiting for 44 gxf6 with the 
threat of £ih6+, Black resigned (1-0).
This win gave me some momentum, but 
nevertheless it was insufficient. In the sixth 
round I employed the Slav Defence against 
Vallejo (cf. Game No.62, note to Black’s 7th 
move), and my young opponent handled the 
resulting complicated endgame very crea­
tively. It all ended with opposite-coloured 
bishops and a draw on the 42nd move. The 
leading positions before the seventh round, 
the last of the first cycle, were as follows: 
Anand and Kramnik - 3’/z out of 5; Leko - 3; 
Kasparov - V/i. The competitive importance 
of my ‘white’ game with Anand need hardly 
be explained...
After 1 e4 Vishy chose l...c6 2 d4 d5 3 £>d2 
dxe4 4 £ixe4 iLf5 and on the 17th move he 
offered the exchange of queens, hoping to 
draw without any problems, but then he 
played uncertainly, as though under some
pressure. Gradually I gained a marked 
advantage, but just before the time control I 
lost it by a premature exchange of bishops. 
In turn, on the threshold of a draw in a 
straightforward rook endgame, Anand sud­
denly began to go wrong and after the fatal 
57-..4h8? he lost. This was my last win over 
Anand - later we played four more draws, 
making the final score of our ‘classical’ 
meetings +15-3=30 (in Linares.- +7=10).
For Vishy this game was a real tragedy 
and it ruined the entire tournament for him. 
I suspect that under its impression he later 
also lost a rook endgame against Leko. And 
yet initially he was playing better than 
anyone and could have taken first place - if I 
had not been in Linares...
And so, after the first cycle things did not 
look so bad for me: Kramnik - 4 out of 6; 
Kasparov, Leko and Anand - Vh. However, I 
drew all my games in the second cycle, 
although I fought as hard as I could. I had 
real winning chances only in. the penulti­
mate round with Vallejo, but I squandered 
them with time-trouble approaching. My 
fighting draw with Anand at the finish was 
also memorable: we were both half a point 
behind the leaders, and in an Accelerated 
Dragon I tried desperately but unsuccess­
fully to seize the initiative.
Despite everything, an interview I gave 
soon afterwards was full of optimism. ‘After 
my loss to Radjabov I set myself a minimum 
program: to win the tournament of the 
strongest players (i.e. without Radjabov and 
Vallejo). Against the main players I scored 
‘plus two’ and, despite bad luck, my ’border­
line’ condition and poor form, I finished just 
half a point behind first place, after missing 
much more. So perhaps things aren’t so 
bad? Is it not rather early for me to be buried 
- as usual, if I miss out on first prize - by 
some well-wishers?’

Life after Death
Linares 2003 brought to an end my long 
series of tournament victories. For me this 
was a warning before the planned match 
with Ponomariov: I needed to prepare more 
seriously and revise much anew. However, at 
the age of 40, and still irritatingly dependent 
on decisions of the FIDE board, it was far 
more difficult to reach a new peak.
Evgeny Bareev: To judge by this tourna­
ment (althoughpom it one cannot make any 
judgements) before his match Leko is in 
excellent form, and Kramnik is very strong. 
Whereas Kasparov and Ponomariov are in 
decline. But, remembering what an incredible 
surge he had eighteen months ago, Ruslan 
should be able to overcome the crisis and 
return to his peak form. And Carry too is 
quite capable of preparing brilliantly for an 
individual event and of returning to the 
proper level of his physical and psychological 
condition. There are two very interesting 
matches in prospect. In them the strongest 
players in the world are indeed coming 
together! Incidentally, at present Anand has 
no motivation, he is simply not interested in 
pghting, perhaps because he is not involved 
in this.’
Alas, my hopes of playing in the unifying 
cycle were not destined to be realised...
Instead of Yalta -  to Crete
European Club Cup (Rethymnon, 27 Sep­
tember - 4 October 2003): 1. NAO (Paris) - 13 
out of 14; 2. Polonia (Warsaw) and 3- Kiseljak 
(Bosnia) - 12; 4. Norilsk Nikel - 11; 5. Ladya 
Kazan-1000 (Kasparov - 4-V* out of 6) - 10, 
etc. (altogether - 45 teams).
Initially FIDE planned to hold my match 
with Ruslan Ponomariov in the summer of 
2003 in Buenos Aires, then from 18th Sep­
tember in Yalta, where a Commonwealth of 
Independent States summit was planned. It
was even announced that the symbolic first 
moves would be made for the players by the 
presidents of Russia and Ukraine.
However, Ponomariov was in no hurry to 
sign the match contract: together with his 
manager Silvio Danailov he put forward 
some twenty corrections, demanding that 
‘the lawful rights of the world champion 
should not be encroached upon’. Then the 
list of corrections was reduced to four. After 
accepting two of them, FIDE announced a 
final date for the signing of the contract - 
midday on 28 August. Ponomariov sug­
gested continuing the discussions in Kiev, 
but on 29 August the FIDE President llyumz- 
hinov suddenly held a press conference at 
the Interfax News Agency and cancelled the 
match. Here is an extract from the official 
press release:
‘FIDE shall not allow the selpshness of any 
one player to cause a hindrance to the unifi­
cation process... It is with deep regret that 
FIDE has to cancel the Ponomariov-Kasparov 
match. However, FIDE shall endeavour to 
proceed with the unification process. A 
proposal shall be placed to the forthcoming 
FIDE Congress in Halkidiki, Greece, 27 October 
- 3 November. The winner of the FIDE World 
Championship in December 2003 shall be 
crowned World Champion and he shall play 
Grandmaster Garry Kasparov next year. The 
winner of this match shall then play the final 
unification match.’
My reaction to the cancelling of the 
match was predictable: ‘The situation shocks 
me - I find myself in an idiotic position. I 
expected that my opponent would try my 
nerves, that provocations were possible, but 
I could not imagine that my opponent would 
simply escape! I have suffered serious moral 
damage, and, not unimportant, material 
damage, comparable to the prize fund of the 
match. For six months I have had to decline
409

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
various invitations and I have invested a lot 
of time and money on preparing for the 
match with Ponomariov.’
My team of helpers comprised Dokhoian, 
Shakarov, Kobalia and, for the first time, 
grandmaster Viorel Bologan.
Later I said: ‘I should like to know who in 
fact wrecked this match. The Ukrainian side 
complicated the situation by raising obsta­
cles in the form of some ridiculous condi­
tions, and effectively the 19-year-old Po­
nomariov was a puppet in the hands of 
influential chess and political officials, while 
I was a hostage of their behind-the-scenes 
intrigues.’
It was rumoured that the Ponomariov 
team received part of the prize fund in 
advance, that the FIDE champion played 
poorly in training matches with Morozevich 
and Short (years later Nigel showed me one 
of the games from the match, which he lost 
SVi-A'A), and that either Danailov & Co., or 
the organisers, decided that it would be 
better not play Kasparov.
The curtain over the secret cancellation of 
the match could some day be opened by 
llyumzhinov himself, but we can only make 
conjectures. Here is the opinion of my oppo­
nent’s representative - Silvio Danailov, the 
current President of the European Chess 
Union:
7 
can firmly say that the Ukrainian side 
was not to blame: neither Ruslan, nor myself. 
It is quite inexplicable why FIDE fought so 
fiercely against our proposals. We had a very 
great desire to play the match. Who in fact 
wrecked it? It is very possible that something 
happened at a high political level in Russia. 
We all know who Kasparov constantly criti­
cises in his articles about politics... I think that 
Kasparov and llyumzhinov know perfectly 
well who in Russia wrecked the match and 
why.
'We have absolutely trustworthy informa­
tion that the day before the cancellation of 
the match Kasparov phoned llyumzhinov and 
said directly: “Accept all Ponomariov’s condi­
tions!" But the following day llyumzhinov 
cancelled the match. We watched his ap­
pearance on Russian television, and he looked 
terrible - it was obvious that for him this was 
a big blow. And one last thing: if Ruslan was 
to blame for everything, why didn’t FIDE 
apply any sanctions against him? The reply 
suggests itself... Of course, it is impossible to 
demonstrate anything.’
Apparently this was destined to happen: 
too many ‘interested persons’ - in both 
chess and in politics - did not want me to 
regain the title of world champion (try then 
getting it back!), llyumzhinov keenly sensed 
this mood, and in addition he has always 
been a faithful soldier of the Kremlin. The 
unification of the world championships took 
place, but only after I left the stage...
And so, in the autumn of. 2003, after my 
intense preparations, I suddenly found 
myself completely without any tourna­
ments. But here Bologan invited me to 
appear in the European Club Cup - to play 
on board 1 for the Kazan team Ladya, the 
2003 Russian champions. And I readily 
rushed into battle, without even signing a 
contract, but restricting myself to a verbal 
agreement with Kazan about payment for 
my participation. I simply needed to play 
chess somewhere!
After arriving beforehand with Dokhoian 
on the Greek island of Crete, we took up 
residence in the cosy village of Panormo, 
some 20 kms. from Rethymnon, where the 
Cup was being held. And on 23 September I 
played a short training match with Zurab 
Azmaiparashvili, at rapidplay (Game No.130) 
and blitz. The score: 2-0 and VA-'A.
The favourites for the European Club Cup

were NAO (Grischuk, Svidler, Adams, Lautier, 
Vallejo, Bacrot and reserve Fressinet) and a 
Russian quartet - Ladya (Kasparov, Bologan, 
Rublevsky, Smirin, Kharlov, Timofeev and 
reserve Khasangatin), Norilsky Nikel, Len- 
transgaz from St. Petersburg and Tomsk 400. 
But, as often happens, life produced its 
changes.
For two-thirds of the tournament both my 
Ladya team and I myself played very success­
fully. In the first round we met a weak 
Belgian team, but it was led by quite a 
strong grandmaster, Vladimir Chuchelov, a 
former Muscovite, who had long been living 
in Belgium. The game took place exactly on 
his 34th birthday.

I had been wanting to employ this ag­

castle on the queenside (where his king will 
feel perfectly comfortable) followed up by 
pressure in the centre or a swift attack 
against the king.

In the second round Ladya managed 
without me (6-0). In the third I won a good 
game against Jobava in a Caro-Kann with 3 
e5 ii-f5 4 ii.e3, after employing an important 
improvement (cf. Game No.129, note to 
Black’s 6th move). After a viscous positional 
struggle things again ended with a direct 
attack on the king.
As a result we defeated the young 
grandmaster team from Tbilisi [4V2-1V2), and 
the following day also Lentransgaz (4-2), 
when with unexpected ease I beat Konstan­
tin Sakaev with Black in a Slav (cf. Game 
No.97 in Part II of Garry Kasparov on Garry 
Kasparov, note to Black’s 10th move). Inci­
dentally, in the early 2000s for a time he 
took part in my preparations: I played some 
training games with him.
Thus I started with three wins. ‘Probably 
the 'highlight of the program’ was the appear­
ance of Kasparov’, Evgeny Atarov, the 64 cor­
respondent, shared his impressions. ‘It was 
evident that, after the forced break of six 
months, the thirteenth world champion had 
terribly missed playing and the tournament 
atmosphere. Even on his only free day Garry 
‘hungrily’ strolled between the boards - in 
dark glasses, hands in his pockets and noncha­
lantly chewing gum; he would glance at the 
score sheets and stand for a long time by 
positions that interested him. And he looked 
completely different - a genuine bird of prey, 
ready to tear its victim to pieces - on days 
when he was playing: the arbiters strictly 
ensured that the public did not crowd around 
the board at which Kasparov was playing... He 
arrived, as for any event that was important 
for him, with his team - trainer and family. 
And all the remaining stars were to some extent 
overshadowed by him. The hall was electrified 
by his presence - as soon as Kasparov finished 
his game, this intensity disappeared, and 
around they were only playing chess.’

Life after Death
After four rounds, having won all their 
matches, the leaders were Ladya (20'/i) and 
NAO (18V2). In view of the short tournament 
distance (just seven rounds), the central 
match between the leaders, which took 
place in the fifth round, could have been 
decisive. And it was a grandiose battle! I had 
White against Alexander Grischuk and 
towards the end of the first time control I 
held the initiative, but my team was losing 
1-2 (on board 2 Bologan lost to Svidler).
Atarov: 'Soon Smirin also appeared in the 
hotel foyer - he had drawn with Lautier and 
he sadly reported to Klara Shagenovna: "We 
would appear to be losing...” At this moment 
Kharlov had a difficult position against 
Vallejo, and even Kasparov's heroic efforts 
against Grischuk should not have been 
enough to save the match.
‘Fenced in by two rows of chairs against 
the spectators, who were pressing in from 
every side, Garry, as though in a cage, kept 
walking from comer to comer - from his 
board to Kharlov’s, from time to time wiping 
his brow with a handkerchief and rapaciously 
glancing first at Grischuk, and then at Vallejo. 
And here a minor miracle occurred, one of 
those that usually occurs with Kasparov: "He 
had nothing, but what a merry-go-round he 
has set in motion!" said the Belgian grand­
master Chuchelov in delight. “How he plays! It 
is something incredible...", those around 
whispered.’

Gustafsson, Calvia Olympiad 2004). It was 
precisely in 2003 that 10 ^ 3  became 
popular, and Bologan and I even played 
some training games with this variation.
10.. .£a6!
A novelty! In the event of 10...h6 11 iLh4 
c5 12 £k3 (Bareev-Karpov, Cap d’Agde 
(rapid) 2002) or 10...C5 l l  £ ic3 (I.Sokolov- 
A.Sokolov, France 2003) White solves his 
development problems and it is more diffi­
cult for Black to equalise. The virtues of
10.. .1.a6 were known to me, but I decided to 
try and squeeze my opponent on the queen- 
side.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
11 b4?!
The position hardly gives White grounds 
for such an aggressive and risky advance, l l  
e4?! h6 12 Ji.h4 d5! 13 e5 g5 is also not good. 
Meanwhile little is promised by 11 #c2 
(transposing into the 7...^.a6 8 e3 d6 9 £>e2 
£sbd7 10 #c2 variation) 11...C5 (Agrest- 
Korchnoi, Malmo 1996).
In the seventh round a new line appeared 
- 11 <£ic3 d5 12 Wc2 A xc4 13 .&xc4 dxc4 14 
#a4 h6 15 i-h4 c5 16 #xc4 cxd4 17 #xd4, 
and in the endgame after I7...^c5 18 ,&xf6 
1Brxf6 19 Wxf6 gxf6 with accurate defence 
Black gained a draw (Ivanchuk-Kasparov, 
Rethymnon 
2003). 
In 
2004 
Grischuk 
achieved the same with 17...g5 18 ^.g3 £*c5 
or 17..Mc7 18 0-0 fifc8, but soon in place of 
16 #xc4 came 16 Sdl! (Atalik-Gershon, 
Athens 2004).
11.. .C5 12 b5 (after 12 dxc5?l bxc5 13 b5 
there emerged 13...^e5 14 ^ 3  .&b7)
12.. .1.b7 13 £>c3 a6
Immediately attacking the pawn chain. 
Later Black tried 13...h6,13..Me7 and l3...Sc8 
(Rowson-Beliavsky, Calvia Olympiad 2004).
14 f3 (preparing &.e2 and 0-0) 14...h6 15 
i.h4
15...*e7
15...axb5! 16 £*xb5 d5 was more ener­
getic, emphasising the drawbacks of White’s
position: 17 cxd5?l exd5 18 &e2 c4 19 ^ 2  
JLc6 20 <S^c3 He8 and ..Me7 with an attack 
on the weak e3- and a3-pawns, or 17 &e2 
,&c6 18 0-0 (18 £>c3 Sa5l 19 0-0 #a8)
l8..Jtxb5 19 cxb5 Se8 followed by ...C5-C4 
and ...e6-e5.
16 ^.e2 cxd4
I6...axb5 17 £*xb5 d5 18 0-0 is now un­
clear (Stohl). By delaying, Grischuk allowed 
me to disentangle myself.
17 #xd4 (not blocking the d-file) 17...e5
A responsible decision, but if Black ‘stands 
still’ - 17...<2^5 18 Sbl! (more accurate that 
my Informator 18 £dl) I8...£fd8, then after 
19 0-0 White’s chances are slightly better. 
I8#dl
In Informator I gave this move an excla­
mation mark, but 18 #d2 was at the least no 
worse: I8...g5 19 .&g3 axb5?! 20 £*xb5 d5 is 
unfavourable on account of 21 cxd5 J.xd5 
22 0-0 or 21...£>xd5 22 e4 £>f4 23 1^61, while 
after I8...£*c5 19 bxa6l? (instead of my 
earlier 19 Bdl) 19-Sxa6 20 Sa2 £fa8 21 0-0 
Black still has to defend accurately.
I8...g5
Exploiting the position of the queen on 
dl, Grischuk prepares a counter in the 
centre. I8...e4 19 Wd4l (not Stohl’s move 19 
f4 because of 19...axb5! 20 ^xb5 d5) 
19-.exf3 20 gxf3 was dangerous for Black,
416

Life after Death
while after l8...£)c5!? 19 0-0 axb5 20 £)xb5 
White would gain what he wanted: he has 
the two bishops, for the moment the weak­
ness of the a3- and c4-pawns is not felt, and 
the black pawns on b6 and d6 are fixed.
19 £g3 axb5 20 £sxb5 d5 210-0
Of course, not 21 cxd5?! £)xd5. White fi­
nally completes his development with the 
hope of exploiting his strategic pluses - the 
advantage of the two bishops and the weak­
ness of squares in the opponent’s position 
(especially in the vicinity of his king) - and the 
possible invasion of his knight on d6.
But for the moment the play is double- 
edged and White’s position is merely some­
what the more promising: he first needs to 
stabilise the situation in the centre and on 
the queenside, without squandering his 
advantages, which is difficult, since all the 
black pieces are active.
21.. .fiac8 (21...fifc81, not moving the rook off 
the a-fife, was more accurate) 22 IfbB
22 
cxdsl? is also possible: 22„JLxd5 23 
1 fd2 or 22...£sxd5 23 e4 £)e3 24 1^6! I ,xd6 
25 £>xd6 £)xfl 26 £)xc8 (there would not 
have been this resource after 21...Sfc8)
26.. .£sxg3 (26...Sxc8 27 -ixfl) 27 £)e7+ &g7 
28 hxg3 with a favourable endgame.
22...«re6?!
Here the queen comes under attack. After
the better 22...£)c5 White would have re­
tained some pressure with 23 14Sfb2, and if
22.. .dxc4 23 i.xc4 £)C5, then 241^2 £sh5 25 
.&.el and JLb4.
23 *b4?!
Black’s eiror could have been exploited in 
one of three ways: by the simple 23 H ad or
23 cxd5 .&xd5 (23...^xd5?! 24 ^.c4 Wc6 25 
Sfcl! £)c5 26 #32) 24 W32, and also by the 
gambit 23 Sfdl dxc4 24 1Td4 Hc5 25 e4 JLa6 
26 £)d6 or 24...Sc6 25 H ad £sd5 26 I to , 
trusting in the power of the two bishops. 
However, as long as diagonals have not been 
cleared for them, White’s advantage is not 
yet so serious.
23.. .HC5
Not 23...dxc4?! 24 Hfdl! (cf. above; my 
Informator line 24 e4 -&a6 25 £>d6 is worse:
25.. .Hc6!). After 23..JLa6!? 24 Hfdl i.xb5 25 
cxb5 White’s position is also more pleasant.
24 a4
Grischuk underestimated my leaving the 
c4-pawn en prise, and was more expecting 
24 cxd5 £>xd5 25 1i ,d2 - objectively this was 
indeed stronger.
24.. .fifc8 (if 24...dxc4, then 25 e4 £)h5 26 
Hfdl, aiming for d6) 25 Hfdl
After 25 -&f2 not only my Informator 
25-.e4 would have done, but also 25...^.a6. 
But now a critical moment has arrived.
417

Carry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
25.. .1.a8?
The wrong square! 25...dxc4? 26 e4 £sh5 
27 fid6 or 26...C3 27 Jk,f2 c2 28 2dcl was also 
incorrect. But 25..~&.a6! with the idea of 
...Jk,xb5 would have maintained the balance, 
for example: 26 cxds (26 JLf2 JLxbS and ...e5- 
e4) 26...£sxd5 27 # d 2 i.xb5 28 ±xb5 £i7f6 
(threatening ...e5-e4) 29 e4 £sc3, or 27 1i rb3 
£sc3(f4) 28 Wxe6 £sxe2+ 29 &f2 fxe6 30 
2xd7 £sf4 31 exf4 exf4 with a drawn end­
game. Now, however, Black’s position could 
have deteriorated sharply.
26Ia3?!
26 JLf2?! is also inaccurate in view of
26.. .e4 27 cxd5 ixds! (instead of the Informa- 
tor 27...£sxd5? 28 1i rxe4!) 28 £sd4 We8. The 
strongest was a difficult move to find, the 
prophylactic 26 Wa3! with the threat of cxd5 
and e3-e4, for example: 26..Jtc6?! (26...e4 27 
f4l) 27 cxd5 £sxd5 28 e4 £sf4 29 ,&,xf4 gxf4 30 
<?>d6 or 26...dxc4 27 e4 g4 28 £sd6 gxf3 29 
gxf3 28c6 30 £sf5, and the miraculously 
surviving knight joins the battle!
26.. .g4
In sharpening the play, Grischuk again 
misses a chance to exchange the powerful 
knight - 26...±c6!? 27 &el (27 £sc3 e4!)
27.. ~&xb5 28 axbs <4lg7, when there is still all 
to play for.
27 cxd5 lxd 5  (27..~&xd5!?) 28 e4!
Restricting the bishop on a8, which Black 
failed to get rid of in time. 28 2xd5 was too 
modest: 28...JLxd5 (this is even better than 
my Informator 28...£sxd5) 29 e4 2cl+ 30 .&.el 
JLb3! 31 2xb3 Hxel+ 32 ®xel 1i rxb3, etc. 
There is no reason to help the opponent with 
the development of his pieces!
28...Sxdl+ 29 i.x d l gxf3 30 gxf3
30.. .£sc5
The only way: after 30...£sh5? the white 
knight leaps across to the kingside - 31 £sd6 
2c6 32 £sf5 ^ 7  33 i.e2 or 3i...Sd 32 Wd2 
Sbl 33 £sf5 £sc5 (more resilient than the 
Informator 33...£sxg3(?) 34 hxg3 and wins) 
34 1ttrc2 2b4 35 A el 2c4 36 1^2+ 4>h7 37 
jtd2 with a growing initiative.
3lWb2!
Although White has been left with a wor­
rying weakness on a4, he has also been left 
with the two bishops and active pieces, now 
obviously aiming at the king.
31.. .£sfd7 (if 3l-2d8, then 32 iLe2 £sfd7 33 
Sal! and2dl) 32 ®d2! &c6?!
Allowing the knight to go to d6 and f5, 
after which Black’s defence is very difficult.
32.. .‘£b7?! 33 £sd6 2g8 34 &e2 2g6 35 £sf5 
(Stohl) or 33-.2d8 34 £sf5 is also weak, and 
34~Jtxe4 35 fxe4 £sxe4 36 1i rb4 £sdc5 
(36...'irxf5?! 37 2f3 ®g6 38 #e7! and wins) 
37 £se3 2d4 38 Wb5, etc., is also insufficient.
418

Life after Death
32...£rf8 or 32...Sc6 was more resilient, 
although it is understandable that with such 
moves one will not go far. The dormant 
bishops are awaiting their hour!

If 33...Sd8, then 34 £>f5 'A’h? 35 JLb3! 1T6

34-.£>b3? 35 Sxb3! Wxb3 36 &C4 1 ^ 3  
(36...#bl+ 37 *g2) 37 £)xf7! would have led 
to immediate disaster.
35£)f5
Allowing Black to regroup his knights. 35 
JLc4!? deserved attention: 35...£)e6 (after the 
passive 35~.Sf8, 36 £sf5 is now strong) 36 
J.xe6! Wxe6 (36...fxe6?! 37 WC2 £ ic5 38 a5l is 
worse) 37 £)f5 £k5 (in Informator I gave
37...Exa4(?), overlooking the murderous 38

£>f5 and wins) 38 &xe5! &h7! 39 a5 Sg8+ 40 
jLg3 bxa5 411Brf4 with a growing initiative - 
most probably Black cannot hold out. 
35.<.&h7 36 Ac4 (threatening JLxf7) 36...<2^e6
Of course, not 36...Exa4? 37 Sxa4 ^.xa4 
38 ±xf7! ^ e 6 (38...1rxf7? 39 l rxh6+ &g8 40 
JLh4! or 38 JiSg5?! 39 ^ 6 !  is even worse) 39 
&f2 <£ig5 40 jLd5, when White dominates. 
Or 36...Ea7?! 37 i.xf7!, and 37-.^.xe4 38 fxe4 
<^xe4 does not work because of 39 WdS!
#xf5 40 JLe6 #g6 41 Sf3 ^df6 42 #xe5 or
4l...^ef6 42 Wc6 with a triumph for the 
white bishops.
37 Sd3!
Into the thick of the battle! 37 JLxe6?! fxe6
38 <£)d6 Sxa4 is now pointless, and 37 ^ 6  
Sxa4 (rather better than the Informator
37.. .£>f4) 38 #xc6 Sxa3 39 l fxd7 Sc3! is also 
not so clear.
37.. .£)dc5!
There is nothing else: 37...£>d4? 38 JLxf7! 
(more resolute than my earlier 38 <£ixd4)
38.. .£>xf5 39 exf5 Wxf7 40 Ed6 or 37...Sxa4? 
38 J.xe6 Eal+ 39 <4>g2 ^Sixe6 40 We3(c3) and 
Ed6, winning.
38 fid6 £xe4!
This piece sacrifice is the only counter­
chance! After 38..Jk.xa4?! the simple 39 Exb6 
or 39 Jk.xe5 1^5+ 40 &f2 is possible, but the 
best is 39 ^

40 h4, when it is hard to offer Black any good 
advice: 40...Sc8 41 Wb4 £)dc5 42 WxbB Jk.e& 
43 ^.d5 and wins.
39 ^.xe6
The alternative is 39 fxe4l? £)xe4 40

Played on the last move before the time 
control with an illusory hope of creating an 
attack! 40 jLxf5+! ’itfxfS was correct, for 
example:
1) 41 2xh6+ ^ 7  (if 41...'&,g8?, then 42 
2h4! 1^6 43 2g4+ ^ 7  44 ®c2+ e4 45 2xe4! 
is decisive) 42 2h4l (the previous 42 2xb6 
£)e6 43 #d5 2xa4 44 ®xe5+ is weaker, 
above all because of 44...'&g6!) 42...2h8! (not

retains drawing chances;
2) 41 ifxhe+l ^g8 42 2f6! - a resource 
not noticed by anyone: 42...1Srbl+ 43 ^ 2

2xh6 4f8 46 ilf6 ^e8 47 ^g2, and in both 
cases White has an excellent position with 
active pieces and an extra passed pawn.
40.. .% 5
Instinctively simplifying the play in time- 
trouble, although the seemingly dangerous
40.. .11.g7! 41 ^hl! 2a7l (only not 41...2xa4?
42 JLxeS) would have led to a dynamically 
balanced position:
1) 42 Aa2 i.g6 43 2xb6 (43 2d8 2d7)

2) 42 JLxeS <5^e4! (a phenomenal com­
puter move, inaccessible beforehand to a

coloured bishops: 44 JLxh6 £*e4l 45 fxe4

JLf8 £>xd6 47 i.xe7 £>xb5 and ... JLd7(d3).
41 Wxg5 hxg5 42 £xe5
In view of the limited number of pawns, 
White has chances of success only with the 
rooks on: after 42 2xb6 2xa4 43 2f6?l JLh3l 
44 i.xe5 £*d7 45 £b3(e8) £sxf6 46 i.xa4 
&g6 the position is a draw. The time control 
had passed, and here Grischuk sank into 
thought...
42.. .£>d7?
Fatal! 42...£)xa4? 43 h4l or 43 2f6! was 
also bad, but after 42...2xa4l 43 2xb6 (43 
2d8 ^h6) 43...^sd7 44 2b7l 2a3l (instead of 
the ‘cooperative’ 44...^xe5? 45 -&b3+ and 
^.xa4, winning) 45 -&e8 2d3 Black would 
have retained quite good drawing chances, 
although he would still have had to work 
hard. Incidentally, on the 42nd move Vallejo 
also faltered, missing a win against Kharlov.

Engaging an interesting mating mecha­
nism. It is surprising that White is able to 
create deadly threats even deep in the 
endgame! It was not easy to foresee this... 
43.~£>c5

Life after Death
44 h4!?
AfteT hitting on the decisive combinative 
idea, foT a long time I was unable to select 
the most precise move OTder. If 44 -&d2 I was 
concerned about 44...g4l. 44 Sf61? looked 
tempting. And after the game I tried to 
uphold the flamboyant 44 a5l? bxa5 45 h4l, 
denying Black a possibility which he had on 
the 45th move (although, as it later tran­
spired, it also would not have saved him). 
44—gxh4 (44...g4? 45 2d5 and wins) 45 a5l 
(45 Sd4? Sxa4 46 Sd8 4b6 47 Sh8+ i.h7 is 
equal) 45...bxa5
Grischuk and I, as well as many commen­
tators, thought that Black could have saved 
himself with 45...£>a4 46 jLd4 2a7l (not
46.. .bxa5? 47 Sf6! Sd8 48 jLe5 and not

jLb3! or 48...‘&g5 49 4^2! £ ic5 50 jLc3l, 
winning), but then there is the decisive 47 
2f6! 2xa5 48 4>h2, putting the opponent in 
a surprising zugzwang: 48...h3 (48...^.d3 49 
2f4l or 48...2b5 49 2d6! and 2d8 is hopeless) 
49 4>g3 2b5 50 2d6 2b4 51 M6! and 2d8, 
winning.
46 2d5! (the most accurate way to the goal)
46.. .£ta4
After 46..JLg6 47 iLxg6+ ^>xg6 48 2xc5 a4 
49 f4 Black is simply a piece down.
47 £d4! £g6 48 &e6! £c2
If 48..JLe8 both 49 f4 and 49 &f2 would 
have won, but the most forceful was 49 2g5l 
2a6 50 2g7+ (apart from the laformator 50 
i.f5+) 50...*h6 512e7! i.h5 52 i.f5l &g5 53

Mate is unavoidable, and Black resigned 
(l-O). A tense battle and an impressive little 
finish! Despite the mistakes, this was one of 
my best games in the 21st century.
The scores became level, and a few min­
utes later Kharlov agreed a draw with 
Vallejo, making the result 3-3. Now the 
destiny of the cup would be decided by the 
two final rounds. But whereas NAO man­
aged to win both matches, Ladya stalled.
The next day we were unable to beat the 
Israeli team Beer Sheva - strangely enough, 
because of me. After four wins in a row, the 
last of which had taken a great deal of effort, 
my play suffered an obvious slump. I was 
desperately in need of a rest, but at the team 
meeting I heard: you have to play! And I went 
into battle, achieved an excellent position, 
and - committed a terrible blunder.

Had it not been for this catastrophe and 
the drawn match (3-3), we would still have 
been in the fight for first place... In the 
seventh, concluding round, Ladya also stood 
better, but we lost to Polonia (2-4), and I 
drew with Black against Ivanchuk (cf. Game 
No.91, note to White’s 11th move).

Life after Death
As a result we finished only fifth and in 
my six games I scored ‘plus three’. Not bad, 
but the bitter after-taste of my tragic blun­
der remained. ‘It will be interesting to see if 
conclusions will be drawn and will those, who 
financed the project, be able to find a ‘scape­
goat’for the poor performance of the team?', 
inquired the sports correspondent of the 
Respublika Tatarstan newspaper. Of course, 
a ‘scapegoat’ was found: the sponsors 
decided that since the team leader had not 
taken first place, it was altogether not 
necessary to pay him for appearing! Such 
are our Russian customs...
The FIDE Congress, which took place soon 
afterwards in Greece, moved the world 
knock-out championship to the second 
quarter of 2004 and selected as its venue the 
Libyan capital Tripoli (this immediately 
brought to mind the 1996 KaTpov-Kamsky 
match, which nearly took place in Baghdad). 
And I, awaiting a new match opponent, was 
again left in a suspended state. Kramnik and 
Leko were also not in a hurry to play their 
match, citing the lack of sponsors...
I concluded this extremely nervy year with 
another match against a chess program - 
Fritz X3D (New York, 11-18 November 2003), 
which also ended in a draw: 2-2. The historic 
moment was inevitably approaching, when 
it would become pointless even for world 
champions to fight against the computer.
Different Sorts of Draws
Double-Round Super-Toumament in Linares 
(18 February - 5 March 2004): 1. Kramnik - 7 
out of 12; 2-3. Kasparov and Leko - 61/2; 4-5. 
Radjabov and Topalov - 6; 6-7. Shirov and 
Vallejo - 5-
Failing to find an outlet for my efferves­
cent energy on the chess board, I again 
became involved in politics and I headed the 
Committee-2008 ‘Free Choice’, founded on
17 January 2004. For the whole year we 
made public statements about the current 
political situation and the need to unite 
democratic forces, and I made speeches 
about human rights and the character of 
political trials in Russia to the US Commis­
sion for security and collaboration in Europe 
and at the Baltic Development Forum in 
Hamburg. Then in December I took an active 
part in the organization of a Citizens’ Con­
gress ‘For democracy, against dictatorship’.
For the super-toumament in Linares in 
February 2004, which was of the usual cate­
gory 20, I was quite well prepared, but I did 
not play as successfully as I had hoped. What 
nevertheless told were my involvement in 
other matters, and my lengthy lack of prac­
tice. Strangely enough, my result was an 
exact copy of Linares 1998: eleven draws and 
just one win. Only on this occasion there was 
no Anand, the winner of Wijk aan Zee 2004: 
he supposedly was unable to come to an 
agreement with the organisers (the press 
wrote that he wanted to avoid meeting me).
But there are different sorts of draws, and 
if you look at some ten games of mine from 
this tournament, it can be seen with what 
passion I battled, trying to demonstrate that 
I was still the strongest player in the world.
In the first round I had another serious 
battle in the Najdorf with Alexey Shirov. As 
we took our seats at the board before the 
game, we sprung a little surprise on the 
spectators: for the first time after a three- 
year interval we shook hands.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
£k3 a6 6 i.e3 e5
I more often employed 6...£ig4 against 
Shirov (Game Nos.40, 51), but in time this 
set-up became too hackneyed.
7 £)b3 i.e6 8 f3 £)bd7
Instead of 8..JLe7 (Game No.45), Black 
tries to sharpen the play immediately by 
beginning counterplay on the queenside. 
9#d2
The alternative is 9 g4. The reply 9-h6 
weakens the kingside (Kasparov-Huzman, 
Tel Aviv (simul’) 1998; Kasparov-lvanchuk, 
Frankfurt (rapid) 1998), and therefore 9-b5 
10 g5 b4 is better, with chances for both 
sides - 11 £>d5 £)xds 12 exd5 i.f5 13 i.d3

in Linares 2004 against Leko (3rd round) and 
Vallejo (14th).
9.. .b5
Planning 10...^b6. From there the knight 
aims for c4, and White also has to reckon 
with ...b5-b4, since the c3-knight cannot 
jump with impunity to d5.
10 a4
In tum, White aims to exploit the early 
advance of the b-pawn by switching the
weight of the struggle to the queenside. 
Other topical lines are:
1) 10 g4 ^b6, when 11 £sa5?l b4 12 <£ie2

White, but he can try for an advantage by 11

Anand success in games with Kasimdzhanov

With the long-known idea of Sa4 and 
£icl-a2, attacking the b4-pawn which is cut 
off from its forces. If 15 0-0-0, then not only
15.. .g6 is good (Sax-Ftacnik, Lucerne Olym­
piad 1982), but even I5...h5l? and ...g7-g6 
(Sandipan-Sutovsky, Pune 2004).
15.. .g6!
A novelty which I had already tried 
against Shirov (Frankfurt (rapid) 2000), 
giving Black good counterplay in return for 
the inevitable loss of the b4-pawn. l5..JLe7 
is weaker in view of 16 Sa4 2b8 17 ^cl! 
(Game No.33 in Revolution in the 70s). Now, 
however, the bishop emerges on to the 
attacking diagonal h6-cl, where it puts the 
dark squares under fire and prevents the 
evacuation of the white king to the queen­
side. In view of the fact that the black queen 
is ready to occupy the a7-gl diagonal, there
424

is every chance of White’s king remaining in 
the centre.
16 Sa4 Eb8 17 Wd3 (not rushing with 17 
Qcl) 1 7 - S a 8 18 Wd2 2 b8

In the afore-mentioned rapid game Shirov 
forced a draw - 19 WdB. Now, when the
15.. .g6! idea had been tested in some thirty 
games "(Shirov himself had even played it!), 
he was ready to fight for an advantage.
19.. .h5l (disclosing colossal tactical nuances)

23 &fl Sxb2 24 Sb4 £)g4!, when 25 fxg4? 
even loses after 25...1i rf4+, and so White has 
to force a draw by 25 Bb8+ or 25 ^ 8 +  
(Karjakin-Naiditsch, Pamplona 2004).
20.. .1.h6!
Insistently inviting the capture of the b4-

have left White with a positional advantage:
21 ^.xd5 #xd5 22 £)xb41135 23 b3.
2i l e 2l
More subtle than 21 l rxb4. Here 21...1ra7? 
no longer works (as with the knight on e2) 
because of 22 !xd6 le3+ 23 £ fi Sxb2 24 
Sal!, but double-edged play results from
21.. .1.c7 22 1^3 (22 #C3? £>xd5!, Ivanchuk-

Tel ^.h6 with the threat of ...e5-e4 and 
excellent compensation for the pawn.
21...0-0!
Again ‘voting’ for a complicated middle- 
game a pawn down, instead of an inferior 
endgame with equal material in the event of
21...£ixd5 22 i.xd5 Wxd5 23 £)xb4 Wbs 24 
b3l, etc.
22 £txb4
For what has the pawn been given up? 
White will now castle, when Black will have a 
weakness on a6, and in addition the inva­
sion of the knight on c6 is unpleasant. It is 
clear that Black must reveal his trumps 
immediately.
22.. .Wd7!
And here is my preparation: such 
‘strange’ moves very much appealed to me - 
the computer does not find them! Here

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
23 £sc6
Of course, if 23 b3 there would have fol­
lowed a queen sacrifice - 23...Wxa4! 24 bxa4 
2xb4- Rook and knight against queen and 
pawn - this would appear to be an unfa­
vourable material balance for Black (that is 
also what the computer thinks). But on 
looking more deeply, we discover that if 25 
0-0 2xa4 Black altogether has nothing to 
fear, while after 25 .&b3 2a8 26 0-0 <5M7! 
(suggested by Dokhoian) his pieces occupy 
comfortable and solid positions, whereas 
constructive possibilities for White are very 
limited. Therefore Shirov does not take the 
queen and even gives up the b2-pawn, 
pinning his hopes of an advantage on the a- 
pawn.
23...Sxb2 24 0-0
This looks very attractive: the a6-pawn is 
doomed, and .&b3, trapping the rook on b2, 
is also threatened.
24...h4!
A very important part of the plan: the 
weakening of the white king’s defences is 
Black’s best chance! The swift march of the 
h-pawn to h3 (h6) was one of my favourite 
attacking devices - remember, among 
others, my games with Shirov and Anand in 
the variation with 6...£>g4 (Game Nos.40, 
116 ).
25&b3
Dokhoian and I also analysed 25 1i rd3 h3
26 g3 Se8 27 .&xa6 Wfs! (an unexpected 
reply) 28 VHxfs gxfs, when, thanks to the h3- 
pawn, Black has a good endgame.
25...H3 26 g3 (otherwise the black pieces will 
acquire the f4-square) 26...e4l
Black has to huny: the rook on b2 and the 
a6-pawn are in danger. Note that the rook in 
the opponent’s rear is not only a weakness, 
but also potentially, in combination with the 
pawn on h3, an enormous strength.
‘It is obvious that in the opening duel 
Black has gained the upper hand. Once 
again Kasparov shows that as regards open­
ing knowledge in the Najdorf Variation no 
one in the world can compete with him’ 
(Bareev). However, for the moment the 
position is dynamically balanced.

In analysis after the game I tried to up­

able to hold out: 32...We3+ 33 1®rxe3 .&xe3+

The missed opportunity 3 l-'i,e3+! did 
not seriously spoil my mood. In the second 
round I was eager to ‘repay the debt’ to 
Radjabov for the previous year’s Linares
(Game No.87), and I reached a rook endgame 
with a powerful passed d-pawn and excel­
lent winning chances. But just before the 
control - in my opponent’s time-trouble! - I 
threw away the advantage with my ridicu­
lous 39th move. This draw was the first 
painful blow.
In the third round I had a very compli­
cated Najdorf in my game with Leko (cf. 
Game No.93, note to White’s 9th move). 
After a mistake on the 25th move I was on 
the verge of defeat and I saved myself only 
with a series of difficult moves. In the fourth 
round I was free, and in the fifth I was 
unable to achieve anything against Kramnik 
in a Queen’s Indian with a2-a3 (cf. Game 
No.lOl in Revolution in the 70s, note to 
Black’s 7th move). Then with Black I confi­
dently repelled Topalov’s attack in a Slav and 
with White I won a decent game against 
Vallejo in an Anti-Meran.
That same day Kramnik also scored his 
first win (against Topalov), and Leko his 
second (against Shirov). This unusually 
decisive round concluded the first cycle, 
after which the leading group was as fol­
lows: Leko - 4 out of 6; Kasparov and Kram­
nik - 31/2; Shirov - 3.
In my eighth round game with Shirov a 
rare misfire in my opening preparation 
occurred. In an ‘anti-Marshall’ with 8 h3 (cf. 
Game No.2, note to White’s 8th move), I 
decided to improve on a variation from my 
game with Kramnik (Linares 2003) and I 
played 19 £ih2, underestimating the simple 
equalizing reply 19...^xd5! (such inexplica­
ble ‘dead zones’ in analysis sometimes 
occur). After thinking for a whole 80 minutes 
(which had not happened since the 1987 
match), I made the poor move 20 £ig4?! and 
after 20...h5l I quickly ended up in a difficult 
position, lost a pawn and also used up 
nearly all my time! Fortunately, on the 27th
428

Life after Death
move Alexey went wrong and, as Yuri Va- 
siliev expressed it, ‘the boomerang whistled 
past Garry’s forehead’: in time-tTouble I 
gained a draw with energetic play. But it 
was a pity that so much nervous energy was 
spent on this...
The next day I had Black against Radjabov. 
This was a festive Saturday - the Linares 
people were marking Andalucia Day, and 
there were many people in the hall. When 
Teimour played 1 e4, I hesitated for 10 
minutes while 1 assessed my playing condi­
tion (in a Najdorf I could expect 6 Ag5), and I 
preferred the solid l...e5. In a fashionable 
variation of the Scotch an equal endgame 
was quickly reached (cf. Game N0.65, note to 
Black’s 10th move). Then my young oppo­
nent gave up a pawn, and for a long time he 
had compensation for it, but immediately 
after the time control he began to ‘flounder’ 
and with his 45th move he made a serious 
mistake, after which my position became 
easily won.

58.. .5g4 or 58...Sg5+ 59 ^d6 Sf5. Then 
suddenly I impulsively made the ‘brilliant’ 
move 55...Sf2 with the idea of 56 <id5(?) ^f5 
and ...Sfl, overlooking that now White 
would succeed in bringing up his king...
56 Sa6+ &f5 57 444! S fl 58 4e3! Vi-Vi
In view of 58...Sxgl 59 4f2.
This was a genuinely severe blow: I could 
not believe that I had contrived not to win 
such a position! Vasiliev: 'It was painful to 
look at Garry. White as a sheet, he forced his 
way through the noisy festive crowd, not 
noticing the papers being thrust in front of
429

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
him - for autographs.’
After the shock I had experienced I 
thought it best to make a 19-move draw 
with Leko, even with White, and in the next 
round, the 11th, I was free. It was precisely 
on that day that Kramnik won a fateful 
game with Black against Leko. From the 
press: ‘Three rounds before the finish a 
change of leader occurred: Kramnik ‘jumped’ 
over Leko and reached the 'plus two’ mark. 
Last year this was sufficient for a share of first 
place. This year -for sole first place!’
In the 12th round, by a tradition estab­
lished in the 21st century, I employed 
against Kramnik the Queen’s Gambit Ac­
cepted. On the 7th move my opponent chose 
a variation with the exchange of queens, 
and already on the 17th move a draw was 
agreed.
And so, two rounds before the finish Leko 
and I were trailing Kramnik by half a point. 
In the 13th round Kramnik was free, Leko 
rattled off a 19-move draw with Vallejo, 
while I desperately threw myself with White 
against Veselin Topalov - I needed to win! In 
a Spanish ‘anti-Marshall’ I did not play 8 h3, 
as five rounds earlier against Shirov, but 8 
a4 (cf. Game No.2, note to Black’s 13th 
move), and I fought with all my might, 
endeavouring to change my fate.
By the 29th move I had less than ten min­
utes left, and on the board a storm was 
brewing: I concentrated nearly all my pieces 
against the black king, allowing my queen- 
side to be tom apart. When Topalov, true to 
his fighting style, replied with the counter­
thrust 29...f5?l, for the success of my attack I 
had to sacrifice a piece. My heart was 
thumping in my chest, pumping adrenalin 
around my body. I felt that a decisive blow 
was imminent, and that I only needed to 
give a discovered check. But where to move 
my knight - to e6 or to e4, forward or back?

G.Kasparov-V.Topalov
Linares, 13th Round, 04.03 2004
32 £se6+?!
A consequence of tiredness and time- 
trouble - I had just two minutes left on my 
clock, and I was extremely agitated. The 
game would have been prettily and quickly 
decided by 32 £se4+ (eliminating the f6- 
knight - the key defensive piece) 32...^g4 33

At the board I suddenly imagined that

variation he would be saved by 34...1Srcl+ 35 
4h2 ^ 4 . When after the game Topalov said 
to me that 32 ^e4+ would have won, I 
retorted: 'But what about the queen check 
on cl?’ And from the perplexed expression 
on his face I realised to my horror that this 
move was not possible, since there was no 
way for the queen to reach cl. A complete

After again missing a certain chance of 
catching the leader and at the least sharing 
victory in the tournament, I experienced a 
terrible vexation and disappointment. More 
than anything I was distressed by such a 
blunder in tactics, which had always been 
one of the strongest aspects of my play.
Nevertheless in the last round I chose 
against Vallejo the same complicated line of 
the Najdorf as against Leko (cf. Game No.93, 
note to White’s 9th move), doggedly tried to 
win and just before the first time control 
was close to my goal. But I squandered an 
obvious advantage, and the result was a 
draw on the 55th move, a long time after 
either Leko or Kramnik had been on the 
stage.
Nikolai Fuzik: 'A drawing epidemic struck 
practically all the competitors... The chess 
‘gods' suffered especially from short ‘grand­
master’ draws. In Linares 2004 the players
who flourished in this occupation were Leko 
and especially Kramnik. True, it was Kasparov 
who was credited with the greatest number 
of draws (ll). However, in his 12 games he 
made 470 moves (on average about 39 per 
game), whereas for Leko and Kramnik it was 
379 (32) and 321 (27) respectively. Moreover, 
Kasparov played only two games shorter than 
25 moves (with Leko and Kramnik), whereas 
Leko played 6 and Kramnik 7. 'Plus one’ is, of 
course, not the result that was expected of 
Kasparov, but he cannot be reproached for an 
unwillingness to fight.’
Sergey Shipov: ‘Kasparov's performance in 
Linares left mixed feelings. On the one hand, 
from the positions reached he could have 
achieved a decent plus score and first place. 
He fought and outplayed his opponents, 
demonstrating his former energy and asser­
tiveness. But only until the fourth hour! I 
think that he lacked concentration and his 
former confidence in his powers. Or perhaps 
he was simply unfortunate! One lucky win 
could have provided a new impulse for the 
next one. But as it was, losing one half point 
after another, Kasparov was not in the best 
frame of mind, which led to fresh losses. In his 
game with Topalov he attacked in his charac­
teristic style and was close to a win, and it 
was only his inner problems that prevented 
him from ‘not strongly, but accurately strik­
ing at the gates'. He confidently won such 
positions when he was a 13-year-old youth...'
After Linares 2004 my self-confidence was 
shaken, and I realised that the time had 
again come to readjust somehow. At the age 
of forty I was much older than most of my 
opponents, who were under thirty or even 
twenty. If age was beginning to affect my 
results and my tactical play was misfiring, 
how long could I remain at the top? I needed 
to thoroughly analyse all aspects of my 
game, and in particular my tactical vision.

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
As later victories showed, I was still in 
quite good form, and in reality the problem 
was not the time-trouble mistakes them­
selves, but the fact that I was getting into 
time-trouble. At critical moments a lack of 
practice told. This manifested itself in inde­
cisiveness and a lack of trust in the accuracy 
of my calculations: precious minutes were 
wasted on re-checking variations, which 
should have been played very quickly. Time- 
trouble is a direct consequence of uncer­
tainty...
A couple of weeks after Linares I won, 
with a fair degree of luck, a rapidplay tour­
nament in Reykjavik, where for the first time 
I met the young Magnus Carlsen (Game 
No.131). And in the summer I took part in 
the Tigran Petrosian Memorial (Moscow, 
10-15 June 2004): a world team (Anand, 
Svidler, Adams, Bacrot, Vallejo and van Wely) 
played on the Scheveningen system with a 
Petrosian team (Kasparov, Leko, Gelfand, 
Akopian, Vaganian and Lputian).
At the start I beat van Wely, but that was 
all. The next day I employed the Sveshnikov 
Variation against Anand, and when instead 
of the canonical 10...f5 (Game N0.85) I chose
10...JLg7, 
grandmaster 
Sveshnikov 
ex­
claimed: ‘Wrong move!’. Here I could not 
refrain from responding: ‘What to do, life is 
difficult!’. In the end Vishy and I drew, I 
scored 3V2 out of 6, and the world team beat 
the Petrosian team lX'/i-lT'/i.
That same summer, after lengthy delays, 
the fifth FIDE world knock-out championship 
nevertheless took place in Tripoli. None of 
the previous winners (Karpov, Khalifman, 
Anand and Ponomariov) took part, nor did 
any of the first seven nominees for the 2003 
chess ‘Oscar’. The 24-year-old Uzbek grand­
master Rustam Kasimdzhanov became the 
new knock-out champion, after defeating 
Ivanchuk, Grischuk, Topalov and Adams
(true, all four only in the ‘rapid’ tie-breaks). 
However, it remained absolutely unclear 
when my match with Kasimdzhanov would 
take place, and this uncertainty played on 
my nerves.
In the autumn, having nothing else to do, 
I again played in the European Club Cup 
(Izmir, 2-9 October 2004), but this time for 
the Yekaterinburg ‘Max Ven’ team. After 
losing to my former Ladya team-mate 
Rublevsky, I won against Shirov, the leader of 
the Bosna Sarajevo team (this game pro­
duced a final score in our ‘classical’ games of 
+15=13) and made four draws - 3 out of 6. 
The results of the Cup: 1. NAO - 12 out of 14; 
2. Bosna, 3. Ladya and 4. Max Ven - 11.
Finally, on 13 October, just before the 
World Chess Olympiad and the FIDE Con­
gress in the Spanish town of Calvia, llyumz- 
hinov held a press conference in Moscow, at 
which he announced that the Kasim- 
dzhanov-Kasparov match would take place 
from 7 to 30 January 2005 in Dubai under 
the patronage of the UAE Ministry of De­
fence. The FIDE President confirmed that 
'this match will be held within the framework 
of the Prague Agreement’, and that "before 
the end of 2005 a unification match will take 
place - probably, also in Dubai’.
I couldn’t help thinking: a fresh commit­
ment, but one hard to believe... However, on 
15 October I was obliged to decline an 
invitation to Wijk aan Zee in January 2005, 
where I very much wanted to play after a 
three-year interval (I was replaced by Judit 
Polgar). And a week later I wrote to the FIDE 
Congress, mentioning a more realistic offer 
by the Turkish Chess Federation to take on 
the organisation of the Kasimdzhanov- 
Kasparov match. However, the Congress 
declined to consider this question, citing the 
absence of llyumzhinov.
Meanwhile, on 18 October the long-
432

Life after Death
awaited Kramnik-Leko match concluded. 
The champion retained his title with great 
difficulty: for almost half the distance 
Kramnik was losing ‘minus one’, and he 
levelled the scores only in the 14th, conclud­
ing game. Thus at least one of the two 
participants in the ephemeral unification 
match had been determined.
Russian ‘Gold’
57th Russian Championship Super-Final 
(Moscow, 14-27 November 2004): 1. Kasparov
- 7'/i out of 10; 2. Grischuk - 6; 3. Dreev - SVi; 
4-7. Morozevich, Motylev, Svidler and Bareev
- 5; 8-10. Epishin, Korotylev and Timofeev - 
4 Vr, 11. Tseshkovsky - 2V2.
Against the background of the preceding 
failures and the agonisingly awaited match 
with Kasimdzhanov, my first Russian Cham­
pionship was exceptionally important for 
me: I needed to rehabilitate myself! In 
addition, I very much wanted to win in front 
of my eight-year-old son Vadik, so that the 
photographs and cups at home would be 
more meaningful to him. This was an old 
dream of mine - when at the opening of the 
super-toumament in Novgorod in 1997 I 
was asked what I still wanted to achieve in 
chess, I replied: ‘I want my six-month-old son 
to grow up and see me on the stage in the 
capacity of champion.’
Initially it was planned to hold a super- 
toumament with 14 players in which, for the 
first time in many years, all three Russian 
world champions would meet at the board - 
Karpov, Kasparov and Kramnik, as well as the 
former FIDE knock-out champion Khalifman. 
But before the start, as the 64 correspondent 
Vladimir Litus wittily expressed it, 'the players 
began disappearing, as in a well-known 
Agatha Christie novel (14... 13... 12... 11...), at 
the rate of roughly one person a day...’
The first to disappear was Kramnik, who 
reported that he had become unwell during 
his match with Leko and had not yet recov­
ered, as a result of which, on the insistence 
of his doctors, ‘he had to refrain from par­
ticipating in any competitions to the end of 
the year’. After this the executive committee 
of the Russian Chess Federation apparently 
considered the number ‘13’ to be unlucky: it 
reduced the number of players to 12, exclud­
ing one of those who had been personally 
invited - Khalifman! A third unpleasant 
surprise was sprung by Karpov: on 12 No­
vember together with me he took part in a 
press conference devoted to the forthcoming 
Russian Championship, but the next day he 
suddenly withdrew, citing other urgent 
matters... The Russian chess press even 
issued a call: ‘Take care of Kasparov!’
My task was made more difficult by the 
uneven line-up of this category 18 tourna­
ment, which strongly resembled Wijk aan 
Zee or Sarajevo: six rating favourites (Kas­
parov, Svidler, Morozevich, Grischuk, Bareev 
and Dreev) and some unpredictable ‘2600s’. 
Talented young players predominated - I 
was the second oldest competitor after the 
60-year-old Vitaly Tseshkovsky, twice a USSR 
champion.
We played in the very centre of Moscow, 
with a view of the Kremlin - in the main hall 
of one of the restaurants in the gigantic 
Russia Hotel. At one time I had lived there 
with my team for the five long months of my 
first match with Karpov... Soon this vivid 
symbol of the ‘developed socialism’ era was 
deemed to be severely dilapidated and in 
2006 it was demolished (like another historic 
chess hotel - the Sport, which was pulled 
down in the autumn of 2004).
In the first round I won a very nervy game 
with White against Bareev in a Caro-Kann 
with 4-..^.f5: I had a somewhat better end-
433

Carry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
game, and the turning-point occurred only 
in the time scramble before the first control. 
Then with Black I shared the point with 
Korotylev. In the third round I was free, and 
in the fourth I suffered a great disappoint­
ment in my game with Motylev. In an end­
game arising from the Petroff Defence (cf. 
Game No.82, note to White’s 16th move), 
towards the time scramble I outplayed my 
opponent literally out of nothing and seized 
the initiative. In search of counter-chances 
Black gave up the exchange and ended up in 
a hopeless position. I could have won several 
times, but after a blunder on the 66th move 
the game ended in a draw (which provoked, 
as far as I know, a mass of sarcastic com­
ments by my ‘well-wishing’ colleagues).
In the fifth round I had another draw in a 
tense battle with Epishin. My tournament 
position at the mid-distance did not inspire 
particular optimism (Grischuk and Dreev - 
3V2 out of 5; Kasparov and Timofeev - Vh 
out of 4), especially since the most difficult 
opponents were still to come.
The next day I had White against one of 
the leaders - the 35-year-old Moscow grand­
master Alexey Dreev, with whom in the 
1990s I had three times won Olympiad ‘gold’ 
for Russia. A win was desperately needed, 
and I decided to join battle in one of the 
main lines of the Slav Defence, regularly 
employed by Dreev.

grounds, intuitively feeling that this was the 
correct decision (in contrast to 18 #d2 b 4 19

It would appear that Dreev was not pre­
pared for 18 e5: after some thought he 
suddenly gave up his knight, which sur­
prised me.

Also flamboyant, but it merely leads to

Instead of this, afraid of squandering my

so!

Dreev now had little time left, and, not

At last I hit on an idea which promises at 
least something, precisely with the bishop 
on e2: White picks up the e-pawn with his 
knight, at the same time bringing it across 
to the queenside. The simple-minded 41 
4>e4 b4 42 &xe5 (42 a4 c3!) would have led 
after 42...,4,b5! (it would appear that this is

42 £>xe5 .&e6 (42...C3? no longer worked

43.. .C3?
The illusion of a quick draw! 43-.^.d5! was

Thus I reached the ‘plus two' mark and 
became one of the two leaders, having half a 
point less than Grischuk but a game in hand.
However, the win against Dreev had 
taken too much effort, and the following day 
I played appalling against Tseshkovsky, 
although the opening was one of my favour­
ite lines of the Sicilian (cf. Came No.37, note 
to White’s 12th move). I simply could not 
decide what to do: equalise or nevertheless 
play for a win? As a result I came under an 
attack and almost lost, but in his traditional 
desperate time-trouble Tseshkovsky threw 
away both his advantage, and a draw... This
439

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
ultra-sharp duel became the turning-point 
of the entire championship!
Litus: ‘At the end of the game, that which 
had long been awaited in the press centre 
occurred. Kasparov came in and began 
commenting on the game. And he did this 
with such enthusiasm, energy and humour, 
that I suddenly sensed it was then that he 
gained his second wind. To all the questions 
the future Russian champion answered 
instantly and he gave an exhaustive reply 
with variations, the spectators listening with 
great interest. Kasparov was bursting with 
energy. Then Garry Kimovich went into the 
auditorium and with his colleagues he began 
discussing the remaining games, something 
he does very rarely.’
Of course, this smile of fortune increased 
my optimism. In the eighth round after 1 d4 
Svidler unexpectedly chose the Slav Defence 
- I...d5 2 c4 c6, and we went in for a rather 
rare set-up: 3 £ ic3 dxc4 4 e4 b5 5 a4 b4 6 
£ia2 £sf6 7 e5 £)d5 8 &xc4 e6 9 £)f3 &e7 10 
&.d2 as 11 £)cl £id7 12 £)b3. In this way I 
had once beaten Ivan Sokolov (Sarajevo 
1999), and now in a multi-piece endgame I 
also overcame Svidler.
That was not all, for in the ninth round I 
scored a fourth successive win - with Black 
against Timofeev, methodically outplaying 
him in a closed Sicilian. And, by reaching 6'A 
out of 8 ,1 moved a point ahead of my main 
rival - Grischuk, whom I had to play with 
Black in the last, eleventh round.
But in the tenth round I had White 
against Morozevich and after a highly origi­
nal opening I gained a big advantage, but 
then I stalled and was unable to break my 
opponent's tenacious resistance. That day I 
as though played two games, attentively 
following events on the adjacent board, 
where the important Korotylev-Grischuk 
game was taking place. In the end Grischuk
rather overrated his position, overstepped 
the mark and unexpectedly lost. Thus I now 
had a point and a half more than him and 
ahead of schedule I became Russian cham­
pion.
Nevertheless my finishing battle with 
Grischuk in a Najdorf (cf. Game N0.76, note 
to Black’s 10th move) was of a crucial nature 
and pleased the spectators. In a time scram­
ble I managed to hold a dangerous position, 
and I concluded the tournament without 
any mishaps, with a weighty ‘plus five’.
At the closing ceremony my son at last 
saw me being presented with a champion’s 
gold medal. He was with me and I happily 
hung the medal round his neck. It was joked 
that Vadik deserved it: every time he came to 
the tournament I was lucky... Suddenly the 
12th world champion, who had disappeared 
two weeks earlier, appeared on the stage to 
make the presentations, and he handed me 
a valuable prize - a chess set made out of 
mammoth ivory (!) in the ‘Karpov Workshop’.
The Russian ‘gold’ helped me to overcome 
the inner crisis and restore the confidence in 
my powers. For the first time I became sole 
champion of the country (in 1981 and 1988 
there was a share of lst-2nd places). The 
success was based on a certain adjustment 
to my playing style: now I expended my time 
more rationally and did not place such an 
emphasis on the opening, as in former 
times, but was ready for a prolonged battle 
in the middlegame and the endgame.
‘All year in tournaments I did not win 
more than one game, and here I scored five 
whole wins! The Russia Hotel very much 
helped me to prepare. Twenty years ago I 
came here, every day, standing at ‘minus 
five’ in my first match with Karpov. Now I 
have scored ‘plus five’ - as it is said, the 
angle of incidence is equal to the angle of 
reflection’, I stated in an interview under the
440

Life after Death
colourful headline ‘I have regained the right 
to vote’. And in another interview I added: 
‘Now I have nothing more to dream about: 
champion of Russia is the last title which 
was not in my collection.’
As for the match with Kasimdzhanov, 
even before the Russian Championship it 
was clear that in January 2005 it was not 
going to happen. And, indeed, soon an 
assistant of the FIDE President announced 
that the match was being postponed until 
the spring, since Dubai had not made finan­
cial guarantees, and that in the competition 
for the organizing countries it was possible 
that Turkey would take part. And llyumzhi- 
nov himself expressed the hope that 'in April 
when financial guarantees are made by the 
Turkish government the Kasimdzhanov- 
Kasparov match will take place, and at the 
end of 2005 its winner will play Kramnik.’.
However, I was no longer much bothered 
about the obvious sabotage of the Prague 
Agreement. The impasse in the battle for the 
world championship had brought me to the 
idea of ending my chess career.
Finishing Line
Double-Round Super-Toumament in Linares 
(22 February -10 March 2005): 1-2. Kasparov 
and Topalov - 8 out of 12; 3. Anand - 6V2; 4. 
Leko - 6; 5. Adams - 5!A; 6-7. Kasimdzhanov 
and Vallejo - 4.
Late in 2004 FIDE finally entered into dis­
cussions with the Turkish Chess Federation 
about the Kasimdzhanov-Kasparov match, 
planned for it to start on 25 April and asked 
for the necessary financial guarantees, with 
a deadline of 29 December. This date was 
later extended to 18 January, and in the 
middle of the month I was informed that the 
guarantees could not be made early than 25 
January.
After waiting so long for this match for 
the FIDE title an enormous fatigue and 
disillusionment 
had 
accumulated. 
My 
patience snapped, and on 18 January 2005 I 
declared that I was ceasing discussions and 
was opting out of the FIDE world champion­
ship cycle, as published in an open letter:
'In 2002 I joined with FIDE in Prague to try 
and unify the world championship. Over the 
past two and a half years, unification 
matches have been scheduled four times and 
each time the deadlines have come and gone 
while the financial guarantees were ignored.
‘Four times I have put my life on hold to 
schedule three months for preparation, play, 
and recuperation. The loss of earnings is easy 
to understand, but the hidden damage is 
psychological. These postponed and cancelled 
events have been deeply unsettling to me 
both professionally and personally. Our 
global chess federation has rarely thought 
enough to even keep me informed, let alone 
compensate me financially or even apologise 
for these repeated frustrations.
7 
called a halt to negotiations last night, 
but resentment at my treatment by FIDE has 
been building for the past three months. My 
life has been totally disrupted for two and a 
half years thanks to this on-again, off-again 
match and I must go on without this con­
stant interference.
‘Perhaps the last straw was watching the 
Corus tournament in Wijk aan Zee currently 
underway in the Netherlands. I was forced to 
give up my invitation to play in this event 
when FIDE insisted that the match would take 
place in Dubai on conflicting dates. It breaks 
my heart to watch such a great event from 
the sidelines. It hurts me, and I believe chess is 
poorly served as well...
‘As of today I have no contract with FIDE 
signed by either player, I have no financial 
guarantee, and 1 know from experience that
441

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
drafting these documents can take consider­
able time...
‘It’s not about money or winning the title; 
it’s about my disillusionment with the process 
and the others on which it depends. In 2002 I 
dreamed of a legitimate chance to revive - 
and reclaim - the real world championship 
title. That no longer seems to be possible. Even 
if by some miracle the match is held and I 
win, I would bear a great deal of responsibil­
ity and still have no opportunity to unify the 
title. FIDE has proven itself incapable of the 
task while others are unwilling.
‘As for unification, I cannot see an avenue 
to contribute further. For those who saw me 
as an obstacle, I will be one no longer...'
At that moment I had not yet taken a final 
decision to leave the chess scene, but I felt 
very keenly that it was time to change my life. 
This decision began to crystallise after the 
cancellation of the match with Kasimdzhanov 
in Dubai, or more precisely, even slightly 
earlier, at the end of the Russian Champion­
ship, when a cherished dream was realised: 
my son saw a competitive triumph of mine 
with his own eyes. But in February, when I set 
off for Linares 2005,1 already knew definitely 
that this was my last tournament, and I 
accordingly tuned myself up psychologically.
I wanted to finish on a high note, espe­
cially since I had not won in Linares for two 
years, although I had fought with all my 
might. However, it was rather difficult to 
prepare for the tournament: mentally I had 
already embarked on a new path. Much time 
was take up by political battles within and 
around the Committee 2008. My personal 
life had also undergone a transformation: I 
had left my previous family situation and 
was planning to marry Daria Tarasova, a 
young girl from St. Petersburg (in June our 
wedding took place, and on 12 October 2006 
our daughter Aida was born). Nevertheless, I
needed to bring my chess career to a worthy 
finish, and 1 forced myself to get ready.
In Linares everything was as usual: cate­
gory 20, seven participants, two cycles. One 
debutant - the newly-fledged FIDE cham­
pion Kasimdzhanov. Of the favourites, the 
14th world champion Kramnik was missing 
- he had supposedly failed to come to an 
agreement with the organisers (or perhaps 
he had not yet recovered after Wijk aan Zee 
2005:1. Leko - 81/2 out of 13; 2. Anand - 8; 3- 
Topalov - 7I/2; 4-7. J.Polgar, Grischuk, Adams 
and Kramnik - 7).
I made a rather difficult start, and did not 
immediately warm up. In the first round 
Leko put pressure on my position in an 
English Attack (cf. Game N0.66, note to 
White’s 9th move), but he did not make use 
of all his chances - a draw on the 26th move. 
In the second round I now put pressure on 
Kasimdzhanov in a Petroff Defence (cf. Game 
No.82, note to Black's 14th move), but I was 
unable to convert an enormous advantage. 
Then, not without a degree of luck, I beat 
Vallejo with Black in a sharp variation of the 
Queen’s Gambit Accepted.
In the fourth round I was free, and in the 
fifth I met the persistent and cool-headed 
Michael Adams.

After this win I reached 3 out of 4 and 
took the lead, half a point ahead of Anand. In 
the meantime, on 27th February the FIDE 
Presidential Council took a decision which 
llyumzhinov was not afraid to call ‘historic’. 
Contrary to the Prague plan, FIDE tried to 
conclude the unification at one sweep - by 
contesting the title of world champion in a 
double-round tournament with the partici­
pation of Kramnik, Kasparov, Kasimdzhanov, 
Anand, Topalov, Leko, Adams and Moro- 
zevich. But, as expected, Kramnik refused to
446

Life after Death
play, while I was already living in another 
dimension, and we were replaced by Svidler 
and Judit Polgar.
This tournament, held in autumn 2005, 
was brilliantly won by Topalov. In 2006 the 
new FIDE champion played a match with 
Kramnik and lost on the tie-break. In 2007 a 
similar tournament was won by Anand, who 
in 2008 defeated Kramnik and became the 
15th world champion. Since then FIDE has 
reverted completely to matches for the title 
- but without me. The golden dream of the 
chess elite was realised!
I did not conclude the first cycle very well: 
against Anand in a Sveshnikov Variation (cf. 
Game No.49, note to White’s 15th move), I 
extricated myself literally by a miracle, and 
against Topalov I achieved nothing in an 
‘anti-Marshall’ (cf. Game No.2, note to White’s 
8th move). However, I remained leader: Kas­
parov - 4 out of 6; Anand and Topalov - 3V2.
The start of the second cycle was marked 
by a gripping duel with Leko. It appeared that 
I was taking the initiative, but Peter defended 
tenaciously (cf. Game No.100, note to White’s 
6th move) and gained a draw, which gave an 
overall score in our ‘classical’ meetings of 
+3=15. Incidentally, in this tournament Leko 
truly became the ‘drawing king’, all 12 of his 
games concluding peacefully!
In the ninth round I very much wanted to 
achieve that which I had failed to do in the 
second round: beat the FIDE champion 
Rustam Kasimdzhanov, my opponent in the 
wrecked match.

It used to be thought that after this move 
Black had problems.
17...0-0!
A novelty - Black sacrifices the exchange! 
Before this there occurred 17...'Sfc6?! 18 <5M5 
or 17...h6 18 jLxcS hxg5 19 .&e3 with unclear 
play (Kruppa-Collas, Cappelle la Grande 
2001). Preparing for the match with the 
program Deep Junior (2003), for which the 
Meran was one of the main weapons, I was 
surprised to see my machine confidently 
replying 17...0-0. Analysis and subsequent 
practice confirmed that the exchange sacri­
fice is absolutely correct, but Kasimdzhanov 
was shocked by such an unexpected turn of 
events...
18 i.xc5
Accepting the gift. 18 b4?! h6 19 .&xc5 
hxg5 20 $Lxe7 WxeT 21 a3 Sad8 is to Black’s

18....&XC5 19 ®e6 #b6 20 ®xf8 2xf8
White is a clear exchange ahead, but his 
pieces are passive, whereas Black has a 
powerful bishop on c5, control of. d4, pres­
sure on f2 (weak is 21 a4?! JLxf2+ or 21 
&hl?! J.xf2), and a pawn majority on the 
queenside.
2l£>d5?l
The primary cause of White’s subsequent 
difficulties. Dynamic equality would have 
been maintained by 21 We2 #e6 and then 
22 Sael jLd4 (Wirig-Hiibner, Cannes 2005), 
22 h3 -&d4 (Korotylev-Dreev, Feugen 2006) or

21.. JLxd5 22 exd5 i.xf2+ 23 &hl
Of course, not 23 Sxf2? ^g4. For the ex­
change Black already has two pawns (in 
addition, the d5-pawn is weak) plus a dan­
gerous passed e-pawn.
23.. .e4?!
The most obvious move, with the idea of 
playing ...e4-e3 with the bishop on f2, in

order to restrict the mobility of the white 
rooks and create threats to the king. But
23...^.d4! 24 Sbl e4 25 #62 2e8 was more 
accurate, denying White a defensive re­
source which he had in the game, and 
retaining the advantage.
24#e2?!
Now my idea is justified. The only correct 
move was 24 d6! (threatening 25 ^.xe4 
£sxe4 26 #d5+ and #xe4; if 24 a4, then 
24-g6!? and ...'ig?) 24..e3 25 a4l (opening 
the file for the rook; my Informator sugges­
tion 25 i.f5 g6 26 Ah3 <&g7 27 d7 is less

Sxf2) 32 JLe2 with sufficient counterplay.
24...e3 25 Sfdl?
In a difficult situation Kasimdzhanov 
moves his rook from fl, making the counter­
sacrifice Sxf2 impossible, and plans to bring 
his al-rook into play after a2-a4. The lesser 
evil was 25 Sadi (25 b3?l c3) 25...#d6 26 
JLf5 - here, in contrast to the position in the 
game, 26...#e5? is not possible because of 27 
Sxf2, but the quiet 26...<&’h8 sets White 
difficult problems: thus, after 27 Sxf2 exf2 
28 #xf2 my Informator 28...Se8 is good, as is
the sudden 28...£sg4l? 29 Wh4 Sxf5 30 #xg4 
#xd5l with an extTa pawn and winning 
chances (3lh3h5l).
25...#d6 26 a4
Strangely enough, White’s position is al­
ready lost: 26 Sd4 h5l with the threat of 
...£>g4, 26 b3 c3, and 26 i.f5 #e5l 27 £e6+ 
i ’hS 28 Sfl £te4l are all bad.
26...g6! (a strong positional move, creating 
the deadly threat of ...£>hs) 27 axb5 axb5
28 g3
It transpires that for the moment there is 
nothing for the rook to do on the a-file, and 
the king must be saved from a direct attack.
28 b3 did not help: 28...£)h5! 29 #g4 (29

added to my confidence and strength. The 
next day I won a rather tedious game 
against Vallejo, gradually outplaying him in 
a quiet Slav Defence. I now already had ‘plus 
four’, whereas Anand and Topalov were on 
‘plus one’.
In the llth  round I was free, and for the 
12th round, with Black against Michael 
Adams, I arrived in an elated mood, ready for 
new creative accomplishments.

Game Nos.45,93) 7 Jie2
Adams liked this idea, although he also 
used to employ the English Attack - 7 f3 
(Game Nos.56, 58, 66, 74).
7.. .Wc7
My usual reply. 7...£)bd7 8 g4 h6 9 f4 oc­
curs more rarely (Adams-Topalov, Wijk aan 
Zee 2005; Linares 2005, 8th round). Also 
after 7-&.e7 White sometimes plays 8 g4 (a 
recent example: Nakamura-Topalov, Sta­
vanger 2013), but Mickey preferred 8 0-0 0-0 
9 a4 £ ic6 10 f4, etc. (Game Nos.37, 86). If
7.. .£>c6, then 8 g4 is also possible, or else 8 
#d2 i.e7 9 0-0-0 0-0 10 f4 (Adams- 
Zvjaginsev, Kallithea 2008). I studied all 
these set-ups before my match with Short 
(1993).
8#d2
8 a4 b6 9 f4 i-b7 10 i.f3 ftbd7 (Adams- 
Kasparov, Sarajevo 2000) leads to a comfort­
able ‘hedgehog’-type position for Black, 
while after 8 0-0 b5 9 a4 b4 10 £ia2 £ixe4 
White is not able to exploit his lead in devel­
opment (Shirov-Kasparov, Astana 2001).
8.. .b5 9 a3
Weakening the future queenside castled 
position. However, it is hard to manage 
without this - perhaps only 9 f3 is more
flexible, avoiding the variation which oc­
curred in the game: 9...^.b7 10 a4l? (Bolo- 
gan-Jaracz, Warsaw 2005) or 9 .b4 10 £sa4 
£)bd7 (Inarkiev-Le Ouang Liem, Khanty- 
Mansiysk (rapid) 2013) 11 c3!?. And if 
9~.£sbd7, then only now 10 a3 (but not 10 
a4?!b41l£ia2 d5l).
9...i-b7 10 f3
10.. .£)c6!?
An attempt to exploit the a2-a3 advance. 
After 10..JLe7 11 0-0-0 0-0 12 g4 £)c6 13 g5 
£)d7 14 h4 (with the idea of g5-g6) the 
position is dangerous for Black, although 
14-..£)ce5 15 f4 £)c4 16 JLxc4 #xc4 17 f5 
2fc8 is not altogether clear (Leko-van Wely, 
Wijk aan Zee 2002).

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
a5! the weakening move a2-a3 is felt: Black’s 
attack gets there ahead of the opponent’s. 
And 11 g4 &e7 12 g5 £sd7 13 h4 b4 
(I3...^a5l?) 14 axb4 £sxb4 15 0-0-0 (15 h5l? 
Kobalia-Kasimdzhanov, Sochi 2006) I5...£sc5 
would merely have led to a simple transposi­
tion of moves.
12 axb4 £sxb4
Black’s rare, unusual plan somewhat dis­
concerted Adams, and he sank into thought, 
looking for the optimal decision.
13 g4
Beginning a standard attack on the king- 
side - Mickey decided that for the moment 
he was not under any serious threat. If 13 
^ b l, then 13..JLe7 (I4£scb5?! Wa5! - Stohl). 
My idea could have been disputed by 13 
£scb5l? £sa2+ 14 ^ b l axb5 15 £sxb5 - in 
Informator I assessed this position as un­
clear, but here I would have been forced on 
to the defensive:
1) 15...Wc6 16 £sa7 Sxa7 (l6...Wc7 17 
<&xa2) 17 £xa7 £ a 6 (l7...Wa4?! 18 £c5!) 18 
<&>xa2 jLxe2 19 Wxe2 Wa4+ 20 <^>bl Wxa7 21 
e5! with advantage;
2) 15...Wd8! 16 £c4!? (16 £sa7 ^.e7l)

Wxb5+ Wxb5 20 .&xb5+ ^d7 21 exd6 <£\b4 
22 c3 £sd5 23 Sxd5! exd5 24 ^.b6 ^.xd6 25 
2el+ &.e7 (25...(£’f8 26 JLxd7 is no better) 26
±c5 ^ d 8 27 ^.xe7+ &C7 28 £h4 with full 
compensation for the exchange.
13...i.e7
I 3...d5?l did not inspire in view of 14 g5 
£sd7 15 exd5 £sxd5 (I5...^.xd5?l 16 .^ W a S  
17 £>b3) 16 £sxd5 ^.xd5 17 JLf4 .&d6 18 
^.xd6 Wxd6 19 Shel, when White has some 
initiative.
14 g5 £sd7 15 h4
Each player occupies himself with-his own 
affairs: White prepares the g5-g6 break, in 
the hope that sooner or later his opponent 
will nevertheless castle on the kingside 
(15...0-0-0? 16 £scb5! and wins), while Black 
builds up his forces on the queenside.
15.. .£sc5!
As it later transpired - a novelty! In a lit­
tle-known game from the Iranian Junior 
Championship (1994) 15-.Sc8 16 ^ b l 
occurred, but I wanted to develop my rook 
on b8.
16 & bl Sb8
An ambush! This move seems risky, and 
for the moment it is not clear in what way it 
is better than the typical I6...2c8 (after
16.. .Wa5? 17 -&C4! 2 c8 18 £sb3 £>xb3 19 
jLxb3 Black is at a dead end) 17 h5 Was with 
double-edged play: 18 g6 fxg6! 19 ^.c4 £sxe4 
20 fxe4 Sxc4 21 £sb3 Wc7 22 hxg6 h5 or 
even 22...£sxc2!? 23 Sxh7 Sg8. But I sensed
452

that l6...Sb8 contained more threats.
17 h5 (not 17 £>cb5?l Was 18 £>a3 0-0 19 h5 
Sfc8!) 17...0-0!
Finally connecting all the forces. This late 
castling ‘into mate’ resembles my game with 
Movsesian (Came No.66).
18 g6 (Mickey looked very content, anticipat­
ing a quick win) l8..JLf6 (continuing to 
prepare a counterattack on the queenside)
19 S d g l
Little would have been changed by 19 
jLg5 JLe5!, when 20 f4? is not possible 
because of 20...£ixe4!, or 19 gxh7+ ,4>xh7 20 
jLg5 ^.e5! with the same idea of ,.JLa8.
At first sight Black’s position is terrible: it 
is hard to imagine that he will be able to 
defend his king. However, he has a veiled 
resource.
19...£a8!!
A second successive quiet move, in unison 
with castling. The rook on b8 comes into 
play, and suddenly it transpires that it is 
difficult for White to attack: his king is also 
uncomfortable!
20 £g5
White naturally wants to exchange the 
dark-squared bishops. 20 h6?! is weak in 
view of 20...fxg6 21 hxg7 .&xg7 and ...Sf7l. 
Also nothing is given by the flamboyant 20 
.£.h6!? £>bd3! (the most ambitious reply) 21
gxh7+ ^>h8 22 £>db5 (22 £>cb5 jLxd4 23 
£>xd4 Sxb2+ 24 ^ a l gxh6 is no better, 
Hofstetter-Fenwick, internet 2005) 22...axb5 
23 i.xd3 £>xd3 24 cxd3 b4 25 ^.xg7+! £xg7

Sfc8, forcing 31 Sh5l #xh5 32 #f4 ^>xh7 33 
fig7+ ^ 8  34 Sgl ^ 7  with a draw.
20..JLe5!
This way, rather than 20..JLxg5? 21 gxh7+ 
and WxgS or 20...fxg6?l 21 hxg6 h6 
(21.Jk.xg5? 22 Exg5 h6 23 Sxc5l 1 ^ 5  24 
£>xe6 and wins) 22 jLxh6! with a strong 
attack. Here Adams thought for a long time 
- and lost the thread of the game.
21 gxh7+?
Of course, not 21 f4? £>xe4l 22 £>xe4 
jLxd4 and wins. However, White should 
have insisted on the exchange of the power­
ful black bishop - 21 M 4!. Now 21...iLf6 is 
equivalent to a draw offer, 21...j.xd4?! 22 
1 ^ 4  e5 23 *c4 d5 (23...exf4? 24 h6! and 
wins) 24 h6! is dangerous, and after 21...fxg6
22 ^.xe5 dxe5 23 hxg6 exd4 24 Sxh7 2f6 25 
fighl Sxg6 261H?xd4 White’s attack compen­
sates for the material deficit.
Things are more unpleasant for him after

cause of 23—f6! 24 fxe5 dxe5) 23...1rb6 24

the death of their king.

In view of 2 7 1 ^ 2  Sfc8.
It was a pity that the tournament did not 
conclude with this striking miniature. It was 
effectively already won: by scoring three 
successive wins and reaching 7Vi out of 10, 
two rounds before the finish I was one and a 
half points ahead of my nearest rivals - 
Anand and Topalov. It was them that I still 
had to play, but I had no mental strength left 
for a big effort, and also I was terribly op­
pressed by the thought that these were to be 
the last games in my professional career.
A draw with White against Anand would 
guarantee me first place even in the event of 
a loss in the last round, since I had more 
wins with Black - the tie-break which was 
known in advance. And I was unable to force 
myself to fight for a win in a Petroff Defence 
(cf. Game No.82, note to White’s 16th move), 
offering a draw practically without any play, 
something which I still regret. That day 
Topalov won with Black against Vallejo and 
was now just a point behind me.
And so, the concluding round, a game 
with the resurgent Veselin Topalov, who 
seven months later was to win the FIDE 
version of the world championship. To 
complete the historic picture, I decided also 
to annotate this dramatic game, despite the 
painful memories. Up to a certain point 
Black did not play badly...

11 d3 h6 (Kasparov-Leko, Linares 2003; 
Topalov-van Wely, Wijk aan Zee 2005) was 
not to my taste. I did not risk playing 3.g6: 
Veselin is well-known as an expert on the 
Dragon. The move 3 .e5 is safer - I myself 
had not played this before, but I knew this 
set-up quite well for White.

I preferred 6 £wi2

6...£>f6
7£>h4
Not the hackneyed 7 ^g5 0-0 8 f4 Sg4, as 
Topalov played in games with Leko and 
Kramnik (Linares 2004). ‘A novelty without 
particular pretensions, but with the advan­
tage that it forces Kasparov to think with his 
head at the very start of the game’ 
(Danailov).
7».£>d4
I did not even consider 7...£>xe4?!: after 8 
dxe4! (8 £>xe4?! d5!) 8..JLxh4 9 f4 White has 
excellent attacking prospects. 7...0-0 with 
the idea of 8 f4 Sg4 is okay, but it could 
have been assumed that the immediate 
occupation of the d4-outpost by the knight 
was expected least of all by Topalov.
8 gB (preparing f2-f4 and £>g2-e3; 8 f4?!

Here I spent a long time considering 
whether or not to play 8...a6 9 a4 ji.g4, but in 
the end I decided that this inclusion was not 
essential.

In principle 10...0-0 was also not bad, but 
then after l l  £>g2 £>e8 12 i.xe7 1i rxe7 13

however, Black seizes control of this impor­

Blocking the f-file by 13 gxf4 is illogical: 
after this there is more than one good reply,

After 14 gxf4 both the simple 14...0-0 and

are favourable for Black. But now a double-

encountered problems.
15.. .6f8
Aiming to seize control of the f-file. The

for example: I6...d5 17 £ixd4 cxd4 18 £ia4

I6  2xf8
16 £ixd4 cxd4 17 £)e2, not conceding the

solid, with equality.

Rejecting the drawing 19 I f l. On seeing 
an opportunity to invade on the f-file, I 
plunged into a calculation of the variations...
19.. .2f8!
This gambit idea appealed to me: there 
was every indication that I would be able to 
force the so desirable draw! If 19-dxc3, then 
20 la4+  £ic6 21 2fl! seemed unpleasant, 
and although after 2l...le7! (better than my 
Informator 21...1g5(?!) 22 lb3!) Black holds 
the position, he loses the initiative.
20 ^xd4 (of course, Veselin did not even

move Wfl and guaranteed an easy draw. 
But, alas, it was not my day-

Exploiting the chance offered. Black 
would not have been caused any problems 
by either 21 £)xc6 #f2+ 22 &hl bxc6 23 2cl

particular drawing variation.
Topalov’s unexpected, seemingly inoffen­
sive move completely unsettled me, and, 
losing control, I chose the ‘most elementary’ 
way to the drawing haven...

Life after Death
‘You don’t have to be a genius to establish 
that the only thing Black should avoid in this 
position is the transition into a pawn end­
ing. But it is apparent that the inner calm, 
necessary for the taking of decisions in a 
game, had been irrevocably lost by Kasparov 
in the course of the endless and ultimately 
fruitless discussions regarding a match for 
the world championship.’ (Zaitsev).
21...1xfl+??
A tragic outcome - a dreadful, inexplica­
ble move. Black had three fairly simple ways 
of gaining a draw:
1) 21...£ixd4 22 lxf6 2xf6 23 cxd4 Sf3 24 
fidl g5! 25 4g2 (25 g4?l d5l) 25...g4, or 24 
Sfl (to me this seemed dangerous) 24...Sxd3 
25 Sf7+ 4c6 26 Sxg7 2xd4 27 Uxh7 Sxe4 28 
4*2 d5l - a worthy counter to White’s 
passed pawns;
2) 2l...£ie5 22 1 ^ 6  Sxf6 23 Sdl £ig4, 
regaining the pawn: 24 c4 2f2 25 h3 £le3 26 
4xf2 £lxdl+ and ...£lxb2, or 24 2 el (24 2d2 
£>e3) 24~.£)f2 25 2e3 £ig4 26 2e2 (26 2f3 
£>e5) 26...^e5 27 2d2 2f3l and ...2xd3;
3) 21...1d8 (a sharper continuation, and 
one that I saw!) 22 le 2  £>xd4 23 cxd4 H>6 
or 22 £*3 1136+ 23 d4 lxb2 24 2b 1 lxc3 25 
2xb7+ 4e8(d8) 26 2b3 lc2 , when the white 
king is no better than Black’s, and if 27 ld 3 , 
then 27...1xd3 28 2xd3 4e7(d7).
22 2 x fl 2 xfl+  23 4 x fl £)xd4 24 cxd4 d5?
An incorrect plan, as is the attempt to 
gain counterplay on the queenside -
24.. .4c6 25 4*2 4b5?l 26 4*3 4b4 27 4*4 
a5 (Zaitsev), which does not work because of 
28 d5! exd5 29 e5l g5+ 30 4*5, etc. Black 
should have stood his ground, avoiding any 
weakenings. Had 1 had even a modicum of 
sense left, I would have played 24...4>e7 25

With the threat of h4-h5. Black resigned

A difficult, highly painful defeat - one 
wants to say undeserved, but it was defi­
nitely not accidental: my mind was already 
elsewhere. During play I couldn’t stop think­
ing about what words I would use to inform 
the public about the conclusion of my chess 
career, and as a result I cracked under the 
pressure.
But nevertheless I was awarded another 
model of the mining derrick - the traditional 
prize for the winner of Linares, this ‘chess 
Wimbledon’. From 1990 I took part in 14 of 
the 15 super-toumaments held here, win­
ning nine times, three times taking or 
sharing second place, and twice sharing 
third, with an overall score of+66 -7 =95.
That same evening, 10 March 2005, I ar­
ranged a press conference, at which I ‘sud­
denly’ announced my retirement from 
professional chess and my intention to 
concentrate both on writing and on social 
and political activity. In my mother’s eyes 
there were tears, and the assembled col­
leagues and journalists also did not hide 
their emotions. To a question, what had 
provoked this decision, I replied:
‘It’s very difficult to quote one reason. If I 
try I could tell you that as you know I am a 
man of big goals. I have to achieve some­
thing. I have to prove something. In Linares I 
wanted to prove for myself first of all that I 
play better than the others. I did. But I no 
longer see any real goal in the world of 
chess. The complete mess of the last two 
years added bit by bit to my frustration. 
What’s happened with FIDE in the past years 
was scandalous and I didn’t hear a single 
voice of concern or support for Gairy Kas­
parov.
‘After the Prague Agreement I had regular 
disappointments with the entire process, 
and this process was used for advancing the 
agenda of others, eventually at my expense... 
I recognise that in the nearest future there 
will be no chance for a reunified title and
458

frankly speaking there is nothing else I can 
hope for in the world of chess. I haven't lost 
my passion for chess, so maybe from time to 
time I could play for fun, definitely in some 
rapid tournaments. But it should be only for 
fun.’
And, indeed, why should I strain myself in 
tournaments, maintaining the No.l rating in 
the world, if the ‘higher powers’ had decided 
on no account to allow a return match with 
Kramnik? How long could I wait and endure 
this conspiracy of silence? 1 needed to move 
forward and concern myself with something 
else, seeing as there were numerous matters I 
was involved with. I have always thought that 
a person should aim for improvement and, as 
far as possible, change something in their life 
and their surroundings...
The era of confusion in the chess world, 
which began in 1993 after the withdrawal of 
Short and me from FIDE, entered a new phase 
from the late 1990s. The easy money, thrown 
by llyumzhinov at the knock-out tourna­
ments, enticed many grandmasters and 
undermined the historic tradition of world 
championships. True, within a few years it 
became apparent that the winners of the 
'knock-outs’ were not altogether genuine 
champions, and from 2005 FIDE nevertheless 
transformed these tournaments into the 
World Cup, switching to the contesting of the 
title in double-round super-tournaments and 
matches of 12 games, and, from 2008, finally 
only in matches.
In 1993,1 dreamed of uniting the ideas of 
the PCA and the GMA, their managerial and 
trades union functions. I hoped that Short 
would rally western grandmasters around 
the new project, but it quickly became clear 
that he did not enjoy sufficient prestige 
among them. Alas, under the fire of constant 
criticism it did not prove possible to create 
an efficient infrastructure, although in
1993-95 we found - for the only time in 
chess history! - a powerful corporate spon­
sor, and for the first time the leading 
grandmasters made proper eamings. But we 
were led down by a lack of solidarity.
When we signed the Prague Agreement in 
2002, Bessel Kok and I were hoping to im­
prove the working of FIDE from within (what 
optimism was displayed at that time can be 
seen in my introduction to Part I of My Great 
Predecessors)), but with llyumzhinov nothing 
came of this. On the contrary, for a long time 
this agreement delayed changes for the 
better in world chess. Thanks to it llyumzhi­
nov retained the post of FIDE President in 
the 2002 elections and he steers it to this 
day, Kramnik acquired the desired legiti­
macy without any particular obligations and 
striking competitive successes, while Kok 
and I suffered a major failure - and again 
zero solidarity!
The dismal state of world chess, the fact 
that it has effectively become the property of 
the capricious ruler of Kalmykia, is in my 
view a direct consequence of the fact that 
the breakthrough, prepared by the GMA in 
1990 and almost carried out by the PCA in 
1995, was not supported by the chess elite. 
They wanted also to be fed by FIDE, and in 
addition they were afraid of the ‘Kasparov 
dictatorship’. Thus a rare historic opportu­
nity was missed. It stands to reason that I 
bear the moral responsibility for this, but it 
should also be shared with those who cate­
gorically refused to support me and did 
everything possible to prevent the necessary 
changes.
Since 2005 I have not only been active in 
Russian politics, upholding the ideals of 
freedom and democracy. I have also had to 
earn a living, and I have been increasingly 
travelling round the world - for want of any 
eamings in Russia. Over a period of eight
459

Carry Kasparov on Carry Kasparov: Part Three
years I have given more than a hundred 
lectures and seminars on the theory of 
decision taking, at firms including Google, 
IBM, Facebook, General Electric and Fujitsu, 
in major banks, universities and at business 
conferences.
2007 saw the release of my book How Life 
Imitates Chess, which was published in more 
than twenty languages. In it I formulated my 
impressions of the mechanism of taking 
decisions, based on an analysis of my own 
chess experience. At that time the global 
consultants firm Creators Synectics included 
me in its list of 100 top living geniuses, and 
the magazine Time in its list of the 100 most 
influential people of the year. And recently I 
have been working intensively on a book 
devoted to current innovatory problems.
After I stopped playing in official events I 
did not disappear from chess life. I contin­
ued playing blitz on the internet, giving 
simultaneous 
displays 
and 
attentively 
following the development of chess theory. 
In 2006 the publication of the five-volume 
My Great Predecessors was completed, and 
after it there followed Revolution in the 70s 
(2007), three volumes (2008-2010) of my 
complete games with Anatoly Karpov, and 
the three-volume auto-biographical Garry 
Kasparov on Garry Kasparov (2011-2014).
I have worked much and I continue to 
work on the advancement of chess in gen­
eral education schools throughout the 
world, constantly expanding the activities of 
the Kasparov Chess Fund, set up back in
2002 in the USA. In 2011 a European branch 
of the fund was set up, and together with 
the European Chess Union it carried out a 
highly successful campaign in the European 
Parliament to gather the signatures of MEPs 
to support the ‘Chess in Schools’ program. In 
the same year, 2012, an African branch of 
the fund was opened in South Africa.
From time to time I have worked on chess 
with the young stars - Carlsen, Nakamura, 
Giri... I have also played a little myself: in 
2006 I shared first place with Karpov in a 
small blitz tournament, in 2009 I won a 
‘nostalgic’ rapid and blitz match against him 
(cf. Kasparov vs. Karpov 1988-2009), and I 
beat Short ryh-Vh in a blitz match (Leuven, 9 
October 2011).
In 2010 I actively supported my former 
opponent at the chess board, Anatoly Kar­
pov, in the FIDE presidential elections. Kar­
pov proposed a wide-ranging program of 
reform of Russian and world chess. However, 
the Kremlin, as well as the leaders of. the 
Russian Chess Federation, gave preference to 
the ‘old-timer’ llyumzhinov, well known not 
only for his chess and corruption scandals - 
but also his contacts with aliens!
Before the 2014 elections, after talking to 
many people throughout the world, I came 
to the conclusion that, using my experience 
of political battles and many years of fight­
ing for the highest achievements in sport, I 
myself should try and change for the better 
the situation in the chess world, and I de­
cided to stand for the post of FIDE President.

Chapter Four
Experiments
Simuls’ against Professionals
As has already been mentioned, throughout 
my chess career I have aimed for unexplored 
experiroents and I have tirelessly blazed new 
trails. Thus in 1996 and 1997 I conducted an 
unprecedented experiment ‘man against 
machine’ - two matches with the super­
computer Deep Blue. And even earlier I was 
the first in the world to began giving simul­
taneous displays with clocks against masters 
and grandmasters - entire Olympiad teams 
from various countries! The current section 
is about these displays.
But first, about the history preceding 
them. Simuls’ with clocks were practised in 
the USSR, and I acquired my first, priceless 
experience back in childhood, at two all- 
union tournaments of pioneers palaces 
(1974 and 1975), where teams of seven 
juniors played in simuls’ against grandmas­
ters - the captains of the opposing teams (cf. 
Part I of Cany Kasparov on Carry Kasparov). 
Later I also gained experience in giving 
simuls’: three times at these tournaments I 
was the captain of the Baku team and each 
time I gave five simuls’. The games were not
preserved, which is a pity: among my oppo­
nents were Khalifman, Epishin, Naumkin 
and other future grandmasters. But I re­
member the results: +26=9 (1981), +27-2=6 
(1985) and +30-1=4 (1987).
Also memorable was the first simultane­
ous display in history where the moves were 
transmitted through space by satellite. This 
was on 30 June 1984. Play was on ten 
boards: I and the five best English juniors 
were in London, and the five best Americans 
in New York. Although four of my opponents
- Adams, Conquest, Ilya Gurevich and Wolff
- were future grandmasters, I won +7=3 (the 
best game was No.93 in Part I of Garry 
Kasparov on Garry Kasparov). There was 
almost the same result in another ‘cosmic’ 
simul’, against ten players who were on five 
continents - in the USSR, USA, Canada, 
England, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Austra­
lia, Japan and Senegal: +8-1=1 (a loss to 
Adams and a draw with Ulibin).
From London 1984 I set off to pick up an­
other chess ‘Oscar’ in Barcelona, where I 
gave a simul’ against seven solid Spaniards: 
+3=4 (among those I beat was lllescas). And
461

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
in December 1985, immediately after my 
unofficial match with Timman (cf. Part II of 
Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov), for the 
first time I took on a professional team in a 
simul’. I was opposed by the Hamburg club 
from the West German Bundesliga, beaded 
by grandmaster Chandler. Before this I bad a 
sleepless night, a two-bour press conference 
in Amsterdam and the flight to Hamburg. I 
began the simul’ just two hours after land­
ing and snatching a meal - I didn’t even 
have time to draw breath!
To this day I remembeT the ironically scep­
tical smiles of the German public: the things 
that the young wotM champion would do in 
OTder to popularise chess. My opponents 
were Teady to play Black on all eight boards, 
and my offer to give them the white pieces 
on four was greeted with joyful surprise. In 
the end I managed to win just one game 
with White, and one, - a memorable one - 
with Black.

But in the other ‘black’ games I lost (in­

only time over all the years I was defeated in 
a simul’: 3V2-4V2 (+2-3=3).
This severe test taught me an excellent 
lesson: I realised that such simuls’ de­
manded serious preparation! The main 
reason for my failure was not so much
463

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
exhaustion, but rather a complete lack of 
information about my opponents, which 
prevented me from exploiting their weak 
points. Appreciating this, I aimed for re­
venge, and all the subsequent events con­
firmed the correctness of my diagnosis.
I obtained additional practice at simulta­
neous displays with clocks in 1986-87, at 
sessions of the Botvinnik-Kasparov school. 
These were both good training, and a sure 
way of studying live the pupils’ styles, in 
order to later work on eliminating their 
deficiencies. The simuls’ on five or six boards 
were notable for the strength of the line-up: 
among those playing, already at the master 
level, were the young Kramnik, Shirov, 
Akopian, Tiviakov, Sakaev, Rublevsky, Ulibin, 
Alterman, Serper, Landa, Oratovsky, Gallia- 
mova... Altogether I played 56 simul’ games 
here, of which I won the majority, and lost, 
at different times, only two (to Landa and 
Oratovsky - not the most dangerous of the 
opponents).
Unfortunately, I have not kept the scores 
of these fighting encounters, which were of 
undoubted value for chess. I will give one of 
the rare games that was published - with 
the 14-year-old Vladimir Akopian, played at 
the first session of the school. In that very 
first simul’ which, to the astonishment of my 
young opponents and their trainers, con­
cluded with the score 6-0.

Black resigned (1-0). Quite a complete,

In May 1986 in a simul’ against the West 
German junior team I confidently won 6V2- 
IV2 (+5=3). This team was definitely some­
what weaker than the one from Hamburg, 
but playing for it were five future grand­
masters - Lutz, Brunner, Stangl, Schlosser 
and Wahls, who I spectacularly crushed with 
White in a Modem Benoni, gaining revenge 
for my December defeat.
My game with the 15-year-old Christo­
pher Lutz proved more complicated.

Developing the correct strategy for this 
simul’ was helped by competent preparation 
- a study of my future opponents’ games. 
This success made me more confident that 
in this way I would also subsequently be able 
to impose ‘my play’ on my simul' opponents 
and take them away from those positions in 
which they felt comfortable.
And, indeed, in February 1987 I gained 
more than convincing revenge against 
Hamburg: 7-1 (+6=2). On this occasion 
Chandler was not competing, but the aver­
age rating of the team had increased and in
466

Experiments
general the line-up was stronger. During the 
play I not only make use of my ‘pin-point’ 
preparation, but I also experimented with 
opening set-ups which I was then preparing 
for world championship matches. In particu­
lar, I won a publishable game with Black 
against the 19-year-old Matthias Wahls.

An unshowy positional masterpiece ‘in 
Petrosian style’.
After this triumph I decided to take on 
national teams, and for a starter in May 
1987 I cmshed the Swiss team 5'A-'A - 
without Korchnoi, but with six international 
masters. It was before that simul’ that I first 
got my hands on a powerful weapon for 
purposeful preparation - the program 
ChessBase, which already then had an enor­
mous database of games. From then on I 
could efficiently and conveniently study the 
play of my opponents, in order then to 
exploit their weak points.
Inspired by these new feats, in December
1988 in the Parisian suburb of Evny I de­
feated the French team ip/i-l'/i (+4-1=1). 
True, not in the team were one of its leaders, 
Renet, or the 15-year-old Lautier, the 1988 
world junior champion, and on board 6 
there was a local club player. Therefore the 
score did not satisfy either me (I was vexed 
by my loss to Sharif), or the French: they 
thought that with a stronger line-up their 
chances would have been by no means 
worse.
And in June 1989 a ‘return match’ took 
place in Evny - a repeat clock simul’ against 
the French national team. Playing now were 
not only Bachar Kouatly, but also Olivier 
Renet (instead of the club player), and they 
held a short training session, with the role of 
team mentor performed by none other than 
Boris Spassky! However, I won by the same 
score A'/i-l'/t (+3=3), beating Renet with 
White and Kouatly with Black, although this 
gripping encounter did not take an easy 
course.

The coordination of the black pieces in 
this game inspired me throughout the entire

This was also a notable event: after this 
simul’ I realised that I could compete success­
fully against the strongest national teams. 
The way was open to even more serious tests, 
but in the next couple of years I had no time 
for simuls’ against professionals.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
On 19th January 1992 I finally made the 
next step: in Baden-Baden I played against 
the German team. For the first time four 
grandmasters played simultaneously against 
me - Hort, Wahls, Lobron and Hertneck. At a 
press conference before the start I said that I 
had analysed 900 games of my opponents!
The display took place in the presence of 
1,500 spectators and was broadcast on TV. 
The prize for a winner was a BMW car, but a 
loser received nothing. The tension was 
enormous, but I managed to withstand it, by 
accurately carrying out my own aim of 
quickly making two draws and concentrating 
on the two remaining games. As a result I 
beat Wahls with White, and, with the score 
standing at 2-1, in time-trouble Lobron 
missed a draw by grabbing a poisoned pawn. 
My confident 3-1 win provoked a furore.
In the autumn of that same year I played a 
simul’ against the Argentine national team 
headed by Panno. In general this team was 
weaker than the German one, but we played 
on six boards and in two rounds - with White 
and Black. I won the first round 4-2, losing 
one game - against Ricardi, then in the second 
round I gained revenge against him and won 
5-1. The overall score was 9-3 (+7-1=4).
After an interval of more than three years 
I again found time for clock simuls’. In 
January 1996 in Rio de Janeiro I won against 
the Brazilian national team headed by Milos 
- 5-1 (+4=2). And in September 1997 there 
came a return match with Argentina. I 
remember that at the start of the display I 
was very nervous: sitting opposite me there 
were now five grandmasters (Panno, Ricardi, 
Spangenberg, Zamicki and Sorin), and it was 
not easy to keep firm control simultaneously 
on six boards. But it all ended well: 4V1-1V1 
in the first round and 4-2 in the second, with 
one defeat - at the hands of Spangenberg. 
The overall score was 8V2-3V2 (+6-1=5).
In the first round game with the legen­
dary Oscar Panno I had the good fortune to 
employ a very interesting novelty.

In May 1998 I achieved my greatest suc­
cess in such displays, crushing the Israeli 
Olympiad team. This double-round match 
simul’ took place in Tel Aviv and was the 
major event in a grand chess festival, timed 
to coincide with the anniversary of the local 
Kasparov Chess Academy and 50 years since 
the founding of the Israeli state.
The young Israeli team was even stronger 
than the German one: I was opposed by four 
‘2600’ grandmasters at the height of their 
powers - Alterman, Huzman, Smirin and
474

Experiments
Sutovsky (moreover, a rating of 2600 at the 
end of the last century was far more impres­
sive than it is today). Of course, they were 
eager to demonstrate that my ambitions 
were beyond the bounds of possibility. 
Makarychev: ‘And on the first day their open­
ing play was simply exemplary: they obtained 
three very complicated positions, in one of 
which Smirin began outplaying his formidable 
opponent with Black!’
Before this I had twice played Ilya Smirin 
one to one (Game No.42 in Part II of Garry 
Kasparov on Garry Kasparov and Game 
No.32). Our third game also turned out to be 
very publishable.

An entertaining battle!
Makarychev: ‘After getting rid of this mill­
stone around his neck and conceding another 
half point to Alterman, Carry began playing 
with inspiration: with Black he converted a 
positional advantage against Sutovsky and 
he outplayed Huzman literally out of noth­
ing.’ The result of the first day was 3-1. My 
opponents were depressed, but nevertheless 
Smirin said: 'Never mind, tomorrow is an­
other day...’
But the next day brought the Israeli team 
even greater disillusionment - an incredible 
4-0! All the games were interesting, includ­
ing duels with White against Huzman in a 
Najdorf (cf. Game No.45, note to Black’s 12th 
move) and with Black against Alterman in a 
Queen’s Gambit (cf. Game No.96 in Part II of 
Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov, note to 
White’s 10th move). At the end of the dis­
play, which I won with the overall score 7-1 
(+6=2), Alterman said: ‘Either we don’t 
understand anything about this game, or we 
weren’t playing a human being.’
In October 20011 faced my last such test - 
a double-round simul’ in Prague against the 
Czech national team, organised by Bessel Kok. 
Again sitting opposite me were young, ambi­
tious grandmasters - Movsesian (2631), 
Hracek (2610), Babula (2566) and Oral (2546). 
Also a serious, solid team!
Sergey Movsesian had ‘old scores’ to settle 
with me (cf. Game N0.66), and I devoted 
particular attention to the games with him. 
After 1 e4 c5 2 £sf3 my opponent chose the
Paulsen Variation (cf. Game No.107, note to 
Black’s 5th move), and after a couple of 
incautious moves he came under a crushing 
attack.

ii.d4?) I managed to hold out against Hracek. 
In my other ‘Black’ game, with Oral, at one 
point I seized the initiative, but then I got 
myself in a muddle, made an oversight 
(32...f5?) and lost. The result of the first day
was 2V2-1V2.
On the second day my opponents were 
eager to get even, and the games took a very 
tense course. The encounter with Tomas 
Oral became especially crucial for me.

Over a period of 14 years I played 11 
simuls’ against the national teams of nine 
countries and I concluded the history of 
these battles on a high note.
Quickly, even more Quickly...
Finally, here is a brief review of my achieve­
ments in rapidplay and blitz. First I must 
mention a friendly blitz match with Tal 
(Tbilisi, 27 December 1978), which ended in 
a 7-7 draw, and a very strong double-round 
blitz tournament (Herceg Novi, 14 Septem­
ber 1983): 1. Kasparov - 131/2 out of 16; 2. 
Korchnoi - IOI/2; 3. Tal - 9V2; 4. Ljubojevic - 
8I/2; 5- Timman - 8; 6. Spassky -  7; 7. Sax -  6; 
8. Larsen - 5I/2; 9. Ivanovic - 3Vi.
My rapidplay match with Short (London, 
4-5 February 1987), which I won 4-2 (+4-2), 
was the first to be broadcast on TV and 
heralded the further flourishing of ‘rapid’.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three
Soon I won an unofficial world blitz 
championship (Brussels, 25 April 1987): 1. 
Kasparov - 17 out of 22; 2. Timman - 15; 3- 
4. Ljubojevic and Karpov - 12V2; 5. HiibneT - 
12; 6-7. Korchnoi and Short - ll; 8. Tal - 
10V2; 9-10. Larsen and Sosonko - 8; 11. van 
der Wiel - 7Vv, 12. Toire - 7. Additional 
match with Timman: I'/i-Vi.
I played a memorable game with Jona­
than Speelman in a GMA rapidplay charity 
match USSR v. Rest of the World (Madrid, 
1988). In one of the then fashionable varia­
tions of the King’s Indian (cf. Game N0.42 in 
Part I of Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov, 
note to Black’s 7th move), I surprised my 
opponent with a novelty involving a risky 
positional pawn sacrifice.

Korchnoi (l-l; 2-1) and Short (l-l; 1-0), in the 
final of the second (1991) I lost to Timman, 
in the third (1992) I defeated Anand, and 
then twice (1994 and 1995) I won stages of 
the PCA/Intel Grand Prix. In 1994 I beat 
ATbakov (2-0), Hjartarson (2-0), KTamnik (l-l; 
1-0) and Nikolic (2-0). Everything was de­
cided by the semi-final tie-bTeak game with 
KTamnik.

by me, two each by Kramnik, Anand and 
Ivanchuk, and one by Adams (in London 
1995, where I did not play).
The blitz match with Kramnik in the ca­
sino of the Cosmos Hotel (Moscow, 1998) 
was the first chess event to be broadcast on 
the internet. This fascinating clash ended in 
a 12-12 draw (+7-7=10), with the scales 
tipping first one way and then the other.

Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov: Part Three

Ivanchuk - 9; 4. Kramnik - 8V2; 5. 1.Sokolov -

In the last ‘rapid knock-out’ won by me 
(Reykjavik, 17-21 March 2004) the pairings 
were decided by a blitz tournament: 1. 
Aronian - 13 out of 15: 2. Kasparov - 12; 3.
Sutovsky - 10; 4. Dreev - 9V2; 5- Karpov - 91/2; 
6. Nielsen - 9; 7. Timman - 8; 8. Short - 7'A-, 
9. Knstjansson - 7; 10. Hjartarson - 6; 11. 
Epishin - 6; 12. Stefansson - 5V2; 13. Peturs- 
son - 5V2; 14- Nataf - 4; 15. Carlsen - 4; 16. 
H.Olafsson - 3'/i. Then I defeated Carlsen 
(1V2-V2), Timman (l'A-'A), Nielsen (l-l; 1-0) 
and, with incredible luck, Short (1V2-V2).
To complete the picture, I will give the 
decisive game with the 13-year-old Norwe­
gian prodigy, who by the end of the 2000s 
was first in the world rating list, and in 2013 
became world champion.

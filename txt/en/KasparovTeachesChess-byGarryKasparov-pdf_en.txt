Foreword 
Over the last two years Sport in the USSR magazine published a 
series of 24 lessons introducing chess fans, in simple language, to 
openings, the most common middle and end games, and other 
typical situations at all stages of the game. 
This series of articles forms a 'chess school', taught by Gary 
Kasparov. B.T.Batsford Ltd. are proud to reproduce these 
lessons in book form. 
Gary Kasparov is World Champion. He was born on April 13, 
1963 in Baku. He won the world junior championship in 1980. As 
a member of the USSR team he shared the gold medals at the 
1980 and 1982 World Olympiads and the 1980 and 1983 
European championships. Gary Kasparov, as the officially 
qualified challenger, has played two matches for the world 
championship with the 1975-85 title holder, Anatoly Karpov; the 
first was aborted after a record 48 games when Gary though 
trailing 5-3 had the initiative; the second in 1985 - one of the 
great encounters in world championship history - 
he won 5-3 
with 16 draws. He was awarded an Oscar as the world's best chess 
player for 1982, 1983 and 1985. 
Gary Kasparov delves into the tactics and strategy in the 
openings, middle and end game. He gives examples from games 
of the world's outstanding grandmasters illustrating endings, 
planning, combinations, and many other aspects of the game. We 
hope that the recommendations of the famous grandmaster will 
expand the outlook of chess enthusiasts and improve their 
understanding.

Lesson 1: Why Study 
The proposal by Sporr in the 
USSR magazine to conduct a 
series of correspondence study 
sessions for their readers came 
as a surprise to me because I 
am still studying the subtleties 
of chess myself. 
After some consideration I 
decided that to write about my 
understanding and interpret- 
ation of chess basics would 
also be useful for me. 
I love chess. I have been in 
love with the game for many 
years and this love is for life. I 
study chess all the time and 
very thoroughly; nevertheless, 
while analysing what I have 
done and in planning for the 
future I cannot help but be 
amazed at the inexhaustibility 
of chess and I am becoming 
even more convinced about its 
unpredictability. Judge for 
yourself; millions of games 
have been played, thousands 
of books have been written on 
various aspects of the game, 
yet there is no chess formula or 
method which can guarantee 
victory, there are no math- 
ematically justified criteria for 
evaluating even a single move, 
let alone a position. Chess 
experts do not doubt that in 
most situations there is more 
than one strong continuation 
and everyone chooses his own 
'strongest' move guided by his 
own experience, evaluation 
abilities, even his own 
character. The possibility of 
using computers as consult- 
ants does not seem very 
serious at present since no 
algorithm of the game of chess 
has been found and there is no 
program which can deal 
reliably with complications. 
Why talk about details, 
situations and stages of the 
game at a time when there is 
no answer to the question 
'What is the game of chess? Is 
it a sport? Or is it a science? Or 
an art?' 
Some say: 'Chess players 
participate in tournaments 
and matches, they fight to win, 
the result is important for

2 Why Study Chess? 
them - 
this means that chess 
is sport. It develops will power 
and helps strengthen oneself.' 
How can one convince 
others of the correctness of the 
opinion of those who are 
amazed at the beauty of 
combinations and the logic of 
chess tactics; for whom a smart 
sacrifice of the queen in a lost 
game is a source of pleasure 
while a dull, forced game 
leaves them indifferent. For 
them chess is an art that brings 
happiness and makes leisure 
meaningful. 
At the same time there are 
many chess enthusiasts who 
can spend night after night 
trying to solve one problem: 
'Why did Black move the rook 
to d8 instead of the knight to 
c6? Why is Black's position 
better?' For them chess is 
mainly a science of logical 
thinking. 
I love chess even more for its 
versatility and manysidedness. ' 
I t  was the beauty and 
brilliance of tactical blows 
that captivated me in early 
childhood. First, it was the 
admiration of this brilliance, 
then the search for it in my 
own games, later it was an 
attempt to play a beautiful 
game - 
these were the stages 
of my growth as a captive of 
the art of chess. But the time 
1 
came when I began to compete 
with others, to take part in 
tournament after tournament, 
and this meant that I had set 
out on the path of sporting 
chess. I still enjoy playing 
beautiful games but I am not 
indifferent to whether I beat 
my opponents or end up way 
down in the standings. 
I want to win, I want to beat 
everyone, but I want to do it in 
style, in an honest sporting 
battle. The former world 
champion Mikhail Botvinnik, 
whom I consider my chess 
teacher, is a chess academic, 
whose work helped to make 
chess a scientific subject. He 
developed my love for chess 
research and for solving 
innumerable problems. In my 
preparations for competitions, 
during my game analysis and 
analysis of openings, I 
\ 
suddenly discovered that I was 
trying to study thoroughly and 
methodically with a persist- 
ence which is typical of a 
i 
researcher. I am convinced 
today that my affection for all 
aspects of chess will help 
preserve my love for it for the 
1

rest of my life. 
My parents taught me the 
moves of the pieces when I was 
only five, and 1 was fascinated 
by them. One year later I was 
taken to a chess group at the 
Young Pioneer Club in Baku 
where I thought I found 
myself in a hngdom of chess 
players. Our instructor in his 
desire to convince the novices 
of the paradoxical character of 
chess set the following 
position on the board at one of 
the first sessions. 
This position, where the small 
pawns were victorious over 
the enemy, was so surprising 
that it seemed like a fairy tale 
and I was unable to live 
without chess after seeing it. I 
have admired this position 
Why Study Chess 3 
ever since. 
I have loved to attack since 
childhood. I still like to be on 
the offensive. But it took a lot 
of time to study the basics, 
which do not seem to have any 
direct bearing on the game 
itself. I am convinced that it is 
necessary for both a grand- 
master and an amateur who 
wants to improve his game. 
and get some pleasure from his 
play in tournaments. To 
achieve this high standard of 
play the grandmaster has 
spent thousands of hours 
studying hundreds of games. 
His talent would not have 
developed without this 
amount of work. If you like to 
play chess but do not have 
enough time for an independ- 
ent study of it, but want to 
beat your friends, you will 
have to spend dozens of hours 
over the chessboard. 
In this series of articles I 
i n t e n d  t o  explain m y  
understanding of the basics of 
chess in a language clear to 
everybody, and to talk about 
subtleties which are necessary 
for true chess enthusiasts.

Lesson 2: Ideas and Techniques 
Before discussing the basics of 
the game of chess I would like 
to show you an episode from a 
recent game and give my 
comments which are prepared 
specifically for average chess 
players. I hope that after 
reading my analysis you will 
see for yourself that anyone 
who wants to make his moves 
meaningful and beautiful 
needs a lot of chess know- 
ledge.

d4 
Experienced chess players 
know that this move, just like 
the move by the king's pawn to 
e4, is the most logical and 
straightforward, or to put it 
simply, the best in the 
opening. Every one of you 
may come to the same 
conclusion after studying for 
two or three hours the basic 
principles guiding the first 
stages of the game which are to 
bring one's pieces into action 
as soon as possible and to gain 
control over the centre of the 
board. 
1 ... 
a 
f6 
This is one of the best moves 
by Black. Black brings a piece 
into action and prevents the 
opponent from bringing his 
e-pawn to the centre to con- 
solidate his domination 
there. 
2 
c4 
Now White impedes the free 
progress of the d-pawn to d5, 
as in this case after 3 cd Black 
will have to choose between 3 
... Wxd5 4 Qc3, when White 
brings the knight into play 
while Black has to make a 
second move with the queen, 
thus slowing down the process 
of bringing his pieces into 
action, or lagging behind in 
development, as it is cust- 
omarily catled. lf Black takes 
the pawn with the knight by 3 
... Bxd5, this would allow 
White to play 4 e4 with a 
strong pair of pawns in the

centre which controls all 
important positions in Black's 
camp, the squares c5, d5, e5 
i 
and f5. 
I 
Let us go back to the first 
lines of our analysis of the 
move 2 c4, where we say that 
'White impedes .. .'. This is the 
beginning of a conscious 
conflict in a chess game. Ideas 
have clashed, the battle has 
begun. The greater the 
player's abilities and know- 
ledge the better he is equipped 
to spot the appearance of such 
micro-conflicts of which there 
are multitudes in each game, 
and the better are his judge- 
ment of consequences and 
future decisions. 
2 ... 
e6 
Black opens up a path for 
the bishop, and, as if trying to 
make up for lost time, gets 
ready to move his d-pawn to 
d5. 
3 af3 
White has a good choice of 
strong continuations, includ- 
ing 3 Qc3 and even 3 Ag5 or 3 
Af4. It is of primary import- 
ance to adhere to the principle 
of rapid development of one's 
pieces and to implement it in 
practice during the opening 
stage. 
3

b6 
Black is concerned about 
the bishop on c8, and prepares 
to bring it to the main combat 
position b7 o r  to the 
alternative one on a6. 
4 
a3 
In order to make this seem- 
ingly passive move one needs a 
deep understanding of 
preventive measures in the 
g a m e  of chess. T h i s  
unobtrusive move by the white 
pawn bars the black bishop 
from an active position on b4 
and at the same time prepares 
to move the white knight to c3 
where it may have a vital role 
to play in the struggle for the 
centre.

Both sides are trying to

Black radically strengthens 
his position in the centre. The 
move ... d5, however, has its 
disadvantages, as it blocks the 
diagonal for the b7-bishop.

by its own pawn and risked 
remaining immobilised for 
some time. Although this 
feature of Black's position 
alone cannot pre-determine 
White's success, a consistent 
accumulation of such minor 
a d v a n t a g e s  allows an 
experienced grandmaster to 
turn the tide in his favour. 
7 
Wc2 
Another micro-conflict on 
the chess stage develops 
around the move e4, which 
would allow White to occupy 
the centre. In choosing his 
move White takes into 
account the fact that after 7 
e4? Qxc3 8 bc Axe4 Black has 
an extra Pawn. 
7 ... 
c5 
Black could have destroyed 
White's plan by 7 ... f5 but at 
great cost. He would be left 
with a weak backward e6- 
pawn.

Q x d

This is a new gain by White. 
He has achieved a strong pawn 
centre and is engaged in 
combat for domination over 
the fifth rank, i.e., over 
'enemy' 
territory. Chess 
players call this a 'space 
advantage'.

Be7 
10 lb5-t Ac6 
11 Ad3 
In chess a straight line is not 
always the shortest distance 
between two points. By 
moving the Bishop to d3 in 
two moves White has gained 
more advantages than he 
would have by doing it in one 
move. Black was prevented 
from replying with the most 
natural move against the 
check, because after, 10 &bS+ 
Qc6 11 Qe5 Pc8 12 %a4 Wc7 
13 Wxa7 Ea8? 14 Axc6+ 
White wins. Black's bishop is 
unfortunately placed on c6, 
getting in the way of its own 
pieces. In such cases chess 
players refer to bad piece 
location and poor co- 
ordination of forces. 
11 ... 
Qbd7 
The bishop occupying c6 has

ldeas und Techniques 7 
forced the knight to take a 
passive position instead of the 
active one on c6 where it 
would have attacked the 
White centre. It could be that 
Black did not want to give the 
opponent the advantage of 
two bishops after 11 ... 0-0 12 
Qe5, but this would have been 
the Iesser of two evils in the 
present situation, as in the 
actual game the black king 
remained in the centre. It 
would be more reasonable for 
Black to see to the safety of his 
king by trying to remove it 
from the centre as soon as 
possible. 
12 0-0 
i

As Black has delayed 
1 
placing his king safely in 
shelter White aims to open up 
the centre at any cost (to clear 
the central files of pawns.) For 
this reason White removes his 
king from the scene of action 
vacating the area for his rooks. 
12 ...

Like 4 a3 which stopped 
Black's ... Ab4 this is a 
preventive move. But 12 .. -0-0 
would have been more 
appropriate. 
An important game 
component is the accurate 
timing of an operation. 
Grandmaster Fforian Gheor- 
ghiu chooses an unfortunate 
moment for preventive meas- 
ures. 
13 ad1 
White centralises his rook, 
foreseeing the opening of the 
d-file. 
13 ...

Black to castle. After 13 ... 0-0

'He who has the advantage 
has to act fast.' This was one of 
the maxims of the great chess 
thinker and the first world 
champion Wilhelm Steinitz 
(1836-1900) who formulated

8 ideas and Techniques 
the basic laws of chess 
strategy. An analysis of the 
classic heritage left by the 
coryphaei of the past is useful 
for all chess enthusiasts and a 
must for those who study 
chess seriously and want to 
improve their game. 
In the above game White 
sacrificed only a pawn but 
gained everything he wanted 
- it opened up the central 
files, tied up the Black pieces 
on the d-file and held the 
. opponent's king in the centre. 
He clearly won the first stage 
of the chess game - the 
opening - and he did so 
thanks to a consistent plan of 
action. However, to capitalize 
on this, one has to act resolut- 
ely and accurately.

Lesson 3: Material Balance 
In order to assess correctly the 
balance of power on the 
chessboard, one first of all has 
to be aware of the comparative 
value of each piece. The king 
occupies an exceptional place. 
It is priceless. It cannot be 
exchanged and any threat to 
its life must be removed, 
otherwise the game immediat- 
ely comes to an end. The most 
powerful chess piece is the 
queen which on average is one 
bishop plus one and a half 
pawns stronger than a rook. A 
rook is also stronger than a 
bishop or a knight by a pawn 
and a half. And lastly, a 
bishop or a knight is about 
equivalent to three pawns. 
But apart from the face 
value of each chessman there 
exists a real value which 
* 
changes in the course of the 
game. This more subtle and 
important notion reflects the 
importance of each chessman 
with respect to its workload at 
a given moment (at the time of 
a gven move), to its prospects, 
resulting from the specific 
situation on the chessboard, 
and to the plan of the game. 
The correct assessment of each 
piece's true strength on each 
move determines to a great 
extent the player's chess 
potential. 
The notion of material 
advantage in chess is this 
disparity of power. When one 
side has gained a material 
advantage it tries to increase it 
in order to break the 
opponent's resistance or, 
preserving this advantage, to 
exchange as many pieces as 
possible and to enter the 
endgame. But it often happens 
that one of the opponents 
incurs material losses delib- 
erately. I, for example, like 
attacking the king's position 
and don't begrudge sacrificing 
pieces for pawns that shield 
the king in order to break 
down its fortress. Thus, a 
while ago I played Lajos 
Portisch, a grandmaster from 
Hungary. After 16 moves the

10 Material Balance 
position was'as follows: 
If one were to imagine that 
the d4-pawn is removed from 
the board, it would be clear 
that the white bishops are 
aiming at the two black pawns 
guarding the king. It has no 
other protection so far. A11 
this calls for a lightning attack, 
the aim of which - 
to strip the 
king of its last defenders - 
justifies the means, in this case 
the loss of a white pawn and 
two formidable bishops. 
First, one has to pave the 
way for the b2-bishop,

The next step is to reduce 
the number of the black king's

Now when the king again 
seeks protection behind its

Marerial Balance I I 
There is an approximate 
material balance in the above 
position. A white rook and a 
pawn confront a bishop and a 
knight. The black pieces are 
poorly positioned however, 
especially the king, while two 
most formidable white pieces 
have broken through to the 
i 
seventh rank and the end of 
/ 
the battle is near. Everything 
i 
depends on how quickly 
White will get one of its rooks

trap for hasty players.

It goes without saying that 
all chess players should know 
and respect basic chess 
principles, including the table 
of comparative values of 
pieces. But it is exactly the 
multitude of exceptions to the 
rules that make chess such a 
fascinating game. They often 
lead to so called non-standard 
situations and balance, where 
the correct path is often 
discovered by intuition and 
experience. As part of such 
experience I recall an episode

The position has changed

Lesson 4 The Importance of the Centre 
The e4, d4, e5 and d5 squares 
in the centre of the board are 
very important. They are like a 
hill giving a full view of the 
chess battlefield and allowing 
a knock-out blow to be 
delivered on any target of the 
board. 
Such expressions as 'battle 
for the centre', 'domination in 
the centre' artd 'undermining 
the centre' also reflect the 
crucial moments of combat 
and are we11 known to any 
experienced chess player. 
The struggle for the centre 
begins with the very first 
moves. The side which has 
advantage in the centre (or 
occupied the centre) usually 
receives an opportunity to 
shift its pieces easily from one 
part of the board to another, 
creating an advantage in 
forces where the fighting 
begins. 
A hundred years ago the 
battle for the centre was a lot 
more carefree and chivalrous. 
White usuaI[y rushed to 
occupy the centre with his 
pawns and would be quite 
prepared to sacrifice material. 
Gambits, or openings in which 
material is sacrificed, were 
very much in vogue at the time.

This was the continuation 
' one of the games played by 
the great Russian chess player, 
Mikhail Chigorin, in 1878. 
White sacrificed a piece and 
launched a strong attack, with 
superiority in the centre 
playing a decisive role. 
Another more vivid illust- 
ration of White's strategy in 
the centre was demonstrated 
At that time this most 
interesting position was no 
less popular than the Spanish 
game is at present. By 
sacrificingapawn Whitegetsa 
clear advantage in the centre 
where he has a powerful pair 
of pawns which, use as a solid 
shield, allows White to

regroup his forces as 
necessary. He has also 
established strong control 
over the Black centre, i.e., over 
e5 (two threats against two 
defences) and particularly 
over d5 (three threats and no 
defence). 
Black cannot play 9 ... Qf6

ing in the centre, they form a 
situation to which Black can 
easily adapt. But each of these 
pawns can move forward, thus 
creating new situations in 
which Black wiIl have to find a 
defence, which is considerably 
more difficult. For this reason 
'a mobile centre' made up of 
pawns is a significant factor in 
evaluating the chances of both 
sides in the forthcoming 
battle.

At this stage, using his

typical operation - he opens

It is essential for each side to 
pay attention to the central 
pawn formation and to try to 
maintain a pawn prepond- 
erance. 
It sometimes happens that 
only one pawn remains in the 
centre. This creates new 
problems, for instance, how to 
occupy an outpost in the 
centre which often permits the 
pieces to be used to advantage 
and superiority to be gained 
over the opponent.

Lesson 5: How to Gain Space 
Since chess is played on a 
limited area of the 64 squares 
of the chessboard, the 
dimension of space, that is, the 
number of squares obtained 
by each side on which they can 
freely position their forces, 
usuaIly influences greatly the 
game's progress. At the stan 
of the game White and Black 
control the same space. But as 
a rule any move in the open- 
ing pursues the idea of gain- 
ing control over a large 
number of squares, especially 
in the opponent's territory. 
Pawns, pressing the oppon- 
ent's pieces and giving their 
own pieces freedom to 
manoeuvre, play the main role 
in the seizure of space. But the 
movement of pawns must 
necessarily be accompanied by 
the support of pieces, 
otherwise the army of pawns 
will soon perish. An 
experienced chess player tries, 
first of all, to ensure 
superiority in the central 
sector of the board, bounded 
by the c- and f-files, since the 
best positions for the pieces 
are situated there. 
To make our discussion 
more specific, let us analyse 
two games. 
The first one was played at 
the end of the last century.

How to Gain Space 21 
Only five moves have been 
made, but White's gains in the 
seizure of chess space are 
great: three pawns are 
controlling very important 
squares on the fifth rank, 
which is the opponent's 
territory. With the support of 
their pieces they will be able to 
advance further, gaining 
control of the opponent's 
territorv. 
In modern chess a reliable 
strategic method to combat 
such pawn chains is an 
immediate pawn counter- 
attack (most often with the 
pieces' support) with the aim 
of preventing the chain's 
further movement or at least 
to make use of it by pawn 
exchanges to open lines for 
one's own pieces. It is followed 
by a pawn assault on the 
opposing pawns with the aim 
of breaking the chain into 
separate sections, or, as chess 
players say, 'islands'. The 
variation 6 ... c5! 7 d5 e6 8 0-0 
ed 9 ed is a good illustration of 
this method. 
Charousek, one of the 
strongest players of the time, 
also tries to restrain White's 
pawn chain, but not 
successfully. He hampers the 
freedom of movement of his 
own pieces and, most 
importantly, makes the 
assault on White's pawn 
centre impossible. 
Black's position becomes 
extremely difficult after three 
further moves.

Qe8

Ae3 
e6 
Under the protection of the 
pawn trident d4-e5-f4 the 
White pieces have many 
squares for manoeuvring and 
can be easily relocated to any 
area of the board. The great 
German player Tarrasch 
solves the problem of realising 
this superiority in a very 
simple way. Fie begins a pawn 
attack on the king's flank. His 
pawns are to open the lines for 
the major pieces, and the 
Black pieces, confined to the

22 Haw to Gain Space 
back two ranks, will just get in 
each other's way and wiIl fail 
to organise a defence.

chess: 'An offensive on a flank

At first glance, this is an 
illogical continuation; after 
all, greater pressure could 
have been exerted along the b- 
file. But White planned to 
open up the c-file and in this 
case it is very important to 
have at his disposal a square of

In conclusion, value space, 
try to grab as much of it as 
possible. But do not be too 
greedy. Your far advanced 
pawn chain could be halted 
and destroyed, and your 
opponent's pieces could burst 
through the breaches formed, 
and then any result is possible.

Lesson 6: Pawn Structures 
Though the pawns are the 
weakest pieces they often 
determine the progress of a 
game and its outcome. If one 
side has an advantage of two 
or three pawns, more often 
than not this advantage is 
sufficient to win. The situation 
is more complex when the 
number of pawns is the same. 
Then the position evaluation 
is largely determined by the 
location of the pawns. 
Before the game starts the 
opponent's pawns are lined up 
on their original squares. 
While advancing forward they 
support each other and restrict 
the mobility of the opponent's 
pieces. Experienced chess 
players often make material 
sacrifices in order to get a 
mobile, flexible line of pawns 
protecting each other, as in the 
following diagram.

Black resigns, 
Wow can one cope with such 
a mighty pawn phalanx? A 
radical remedy is called for: it 
is necessary to destroy the 
whole line or at least its middle 
link, in other words, to break 
the chain into seperate entities 
unable to protect each other. 
If often happens, however, 
that the most effective method 
of fighting a mobile pawn line 
is to contain its mobility or to 
set up a blockade. This can be 
done, for instance, by 
'covering' the squares in front 
of the pawns, For example , a 
line of black pawns on c4, d5 
and e6 may be contained by a 
white bishop located on the 
diagonal a l -h8. 
But when the advance of the 
above pawns is supported by a 
Black knight from c6, the 
White bishop alone is unable 
to stop the advance of the 
pawn chain. 
The best way to set up a 
blockade is to restrain pawns 
with pawns. If Black pawns on 
c4, d5 and e6 were held not by 
a bishop but by three pawns 
located on c3, d4 and e5,

this would form an insunn- 
ountabfe barrier. 
In modern chess the 
opposing parties try to restrict 
the mobility of pawn lines in 
the early stages of the game 
Take this opening for 
example:

be7 
As you can see, three pawns 
c4, d5, e4 are opposed by a 
Black formation c5, eS, 
protected by a pawn on d6. 
This turns out to be sufficient 
to make the position in the 
centre stable, Not all players, 
however, try to restrict pawn 
mobility with such thorough- 
ness. The dynamic properties 
of the pawn line offer great 
opportunities for a combinat- 
ive game which can lead to 
interesting complications, 
particularly when the 
opponents have a preference 
for an open game. On the 
other hand, a stationary 
blocked pawn chain often 
makes for a 
slow and 
unspectacular development of 
the game. 
You may have come across 
in chess literature or in 
commentaries on games such 
terms 
as 'weak pawn', 
'isolated pawn', etc, Each of 
them denotes a flaw in the 
pawn structure which restricts 
its mobitity and increases its 
vulnerability. 
Here is a simple example.

Here is an effective ending 
from a game between two 
Polish players, Tulkowski and 
Wojciewski, played in Poznan 
some 55 years ago. 
28 Pawn Structures 
Despite the obstacle of the 
Black king, Wbite, playing 
correctly, can not only protect 
the pawn but can shepherd it 
through to promotion. But as 
soon as we move the White 
king, say, to the h-file, the 
pawn becomes weak because it 
falls under an easy attack from 
the Black king.

ther common weaknesses 
of the pawn formation include 
pawns doubted or trebled on 
the same file. Therefore it is

and to avoid weaknesses in it 
as far as possible. Experienced 
chess players may use the 
exception to the rule. It is the 
ability to appreciate when 
exceptions are justified that to 
a great degree makes chess so 
beautiful and full of surprises.

Lesson 7: Dynamism and Initiative 
The rules of chess are similar 
to those of any other sport, 
and not only sport: success 
comes to those who are more 
active, skilful and resourceful. 
Then what is dynamism in 
the game of chess? In my 
opinion, dynamism is the 
strengthening of the positions 
of one's pieces with each move 
and the threatening of the 
opponent's pieces. To make 
the moves successful they have 
to fall within the rules of the 
game and to be based on a 
solid tactical foundation. 
A chess player with a 
reputation as an energetic 
individual normally tries from 
the very outset to impose his 
own style on the opponent, 
forcing him to tackle 
numerous problems. 
To illustrate the principles 
of active play let us analyse a 
game by the then world 
champion Ana toly Karpov.

Some results of the opening 
are evident. White has limited 
the opponent's pieces on the 
king's flank to the back two 
ranks with the knight on d7 
blocking the bishop on c8 and 
even the queen, to some 
extent.

This is a very interesting and 
active idea which leads to a 
balanced deployment of the 
pieces. Karpov places his 
queen on the e-file where it will 
not be in the way of the rook 
on d l  and at the same time 
creates combinational threats. 
The queen does not obstruct 
the bishop on fl which is 
about to go to h3 with a latter 
Axe6. As you can see, each 
White move is effective and 
builds up pressure.

The opponent's response is 
of a forced nature. Black is 
forced back and tries to find 
some remedy to prevent White 
from making a decisive 
advance. It is, however, late in 
the game, and for this reason 
Black's latest move carries 
more despair than justfied 
action.

Black tries to force the 
knight away from its control 
of d5. He is logical in his 
advance but his strategy lacks 
a solid base, and his pieces are 
poorly placed. How can White 
take advantage of these weak 
points? 
14 Qd5! 
This is a most effective 
move as the bishop on d4 
becomes powerful and the 
White queen joins the fray,

Rook manoeuvres along the 
third rank are among the 
champion's favourite tactics. 
In this case his move not only 
precedes the queen exchange 
but also serves the purpose of 
improving the co-ordination 
of the White pieces. The co- 
ordination of the pieces is a 
very important factor which in 
effect determines the strength 
of a chess player. The ability to 
co-ordinate the moves of each 
piece and of each pawn in such 
a way that they act together in 
a single plan and at the same 
time protect each other is a 
great art. 
Here again both rooks on 
the third rank are ready to

support the progress of the 
two central pawns while the 
queen protects c2 and is ready 
to help the rooks. The pawn 
duo (d5, e5), protected by its 
own pieces, is a powerful 
force. Such pawns can push 
the opponent's pieces to the 
back rank and disorganise 
their actions.

Lesson 8: Avoiding Disaster in the Opening 
Having barely learned the 
basics of the game, every chess 
player will notice that moves 
in the opening, when almost 
all pieces are still on the board, 
most often predetermine the 
course of the game and in 
some cases its outcome. More 
often than not a chess player 
who has mastered the basics 
and seen brilliant attacks by 
masters and grandmasters has 
to spend the whole game in a 
boring defence trying to mend 
gaps in his position which 
appeared in the opening, but 
with little success. This is a 
result of a poor knowledge of 
the theory of openings and a 
lack of basic skills in playing 
the first stage of the game. 
A chess game is to a certain 
extent similar to military 
combat where, as is known, a 
lot depends not only on the 
technical abilities and 
equipment of the troops but 
also on the ability of the 
commanders to foresee the 
contours of the forthcoming 
battle and deploy troops 
accordingly in order to 
commit them in due time and 
in the most favourable 
sequence. It is for this reason 
that every player who directs 
the actions of his wooden 
troops ought to know the 
basics of the game in the 
opening. 
It is a known fact that any 
chess game may be preserved 
for posterity, as it is recorded 
by means of chess notation. 
An enormous number of 
games have been recorded in 
the history of chess and their 
analysis has helped develop all 
the nuances of opening 
strategy. 
I do not intend to delve into 
all the existing openings and 
their character~stics, which 
would be an impossible task to 
handle, In view of the abund- 
ance of information. I will 
confine myself to describing 
some general principles of the 
opening and how to avoid 
disaster.

36 Avoiding Disaster in the Opening 
The First Principle 
The opening is won by the 
player who brings major pieces 
into play faster. 
This is a basic rule and it is 
very important to use it 
correctly . 
Let us take a simple 
example. 
1 
e3 
e5 
2 
Ac4 
Qc6 
3 wf3 
kc5 
4 
W x f l  mate 
It looks as if White has done 
everything correctly - two 
pieces were developed and 
White mated. Nevertheless, the 
play deserves some criticism. 
The first move is poor. We 
have stated in one of our 
previous lessons how important 
it is to occupy the centre of the 
board with one's pawns. This 
has to be done in the opening so 
as to locate one's pieces most 
favourably. It is for this reason 
that e4 is stronger and more 
logical than e3. I want to stress 
once again that it is important 
to try to capture squares with 
pawns, especially the central 
squares. 
The second White move (2 
l c 4 )  is not so easy to reject, 
though its merits are not very 
high for two reasons. The 
experience of previous gener- 
ations gives us the best proced- 
ure for advancing one's pieces 
- first the pawns advance to 
the centre, then the knights 
move in, followed by the 
bishops and only later the 
heavy pieces - 
the rooks and 
the queens. In our case the 
bishop jumped out to a 
powerful position without 
regard to a possible response 
from Black - 
2 ... d5, in which 
case the latter gets a powerful 
pawn centre and the White 
bishop is forced to poorer 
locations on d3, e2, b5 or b3. 
Chess is a game of logic and 
a combination of a timid 1 e3 
and an aggressive 2 Pc4 is 
illogical and for this reason 
should be punished. Black 
replied with 2 ... Qc6, which is 
to be viewed as a regular but 
not the strongest continuation

loiding Disaster in the Opening 37 
in this situation. It is true that 
2 ,+. Qc6 accords with the 
of rapid develop- 
ment of the pieces but it does 
create problems for White 
which could have been the 
case had he moved 2 ... d5! 
White's third move 3 l f 3  
looks effective, but an 
experienced player would not 
have made it; moreover, he 
would not have even consid- 
ered it. Had Black reacted 
correctly with 3 ... Qf6!, the 
move of the queen would have 
been wasted. Furthermore, by 
occupying 0, the queen 
robbed his king's knight of a 
good square for its actions and 
the latter has no choice but to 
occupy a passive position on 
e2 or move to h3, thus staying 
away from all the action in the 
centre. The most powerful 
chess piece, the queen, should 
not move into the fray hastily, 
otherwise the opponent's 
minor pieces might pursue it 
with a gain of time. As for 
Black's 3 ... lc5??, it is logical 
only from the formal 
viewpoint (Black develops a 
second piece in the approp- 
riate sequence) as it loses the 
game. The fact is that Black 
has not taken into account a 
real threat from the opponent. 
You can see how much can be 
discovered during a careful 
analysis of a very brief game 
full of mutual errors. 
We will illustrate the first 
principle of the opening - 
the rapid development of the 
pieces - by a game played 
over a century ago.

This old and romantic 
opening, which has acquired a 
beautiful name 'The King's 
Gambit', often resolves the 
outcome of the battle by a 
rapid advance of pieces. 
Modern theory believes that 
the best defence here is a 
counterattack. And this was 
clearly demonstrated by the 
talented American chess 
player Paul Morphy.

We will continue to study 
the principles used in the 
openings in our next chapter.

Lesson 9: Neglecting Opening Principles 
In our last lesson we learned 
that domination in the centre 
and rapid development of the 
pieces to a great degree 
determines the outcome of the 
battle in the opening, 
particularly when played by 
experienced players. Before 
proceeding further with 
opening theory, let us analyse 
errors most often committed 
in the initial stage of the game 
by inexperienced players. 
First of all, it is important to 
remember that the must 
vulnerable points in kingside 
defence are those protected by 
the king alone. In the initial 
position these points are the f2 
and fl-pawns; after kingside 
castling they are the h2, g2, h7 
and g7-pawns. Protection of 
these squares is of foremost 
concern. Experience shows 
that, as a rule, it is on these 
squares that disasters occur in 
even the most sophisticated 
opening systems. 
Let us analyse a position 
which occurs up in the old and 
very romantic Italian game:

Instead of the cautious 7 
Ad2, White decides to sacrif- 
ice two pawns and a rook for 
the sake of rapid development 
- a typical device used by 
players with an aggressive 
style. Modern methods of 
struggle in the opening, based 
on the experience of past 
generations, do not favour 
Black's next moves, but one 
has to bear in mind that this 
was how the game was played 
one hundred years ago when 
nobody cast doubt on the 
principle 'any sacrifice must 
be taken'.

Black has taken two enemy 
pawns but lags behind in 
development. The punishment 
for such violations of opening 
rules usually follows very 
swiftly and savagely. The old 
analysis is a good illustration 
of the disastrous consequen- 
ces of 'greed' in the opening. 
You should not think, 
however, that this experience 
is of historical value only. This 
situation is very frequent in 
simultaneous exhibitions. Do 
not get carried away capturing 
your opponent's pawns in the 
opening to the detriment of 
your own forces' mobilisation. 
10 Wb3 
Axal 
Black is consistent in his 
desire to capture as much 
material as possible and loses 
his last chance to get his king 
out of the centre. And the 
chance was there: 10 ... d5 11

This is the hour of reckon- 
ing for ignoring development 
and devouring pawns in the 
opening. By the way, it was on 
f7 that the disaster occurred. 
Black is lost no matter how he 
defends. For instance, 13 ...

Besides chasing pawns, 
another typical error of many 
chess players is delaying the 
removal of the king from the 
centre. In master practice, 
there are games when both 
kings remain in the very centre 
of action and survive, but this 
is an exception to the rule and

42 Neglecting Opening Principles 
is based on a profound 
understanding of the situation 
and on defensive skills. 
Beginners and those with 
insufflcitnt experience should 
castle at the earliest opport- 
unity. By remaining in the 
centre, the king may be lured 
to the very centre of the board 
by sacrifices and then disaster 
becomes imminent.

Black's unsophisticated de-

This is an altogether

instead of 
developing his pieces (for

the intervention of the White 
knight on g5. However, to 
prove the unsoundness of 
Black's strategy in the opening

Lesson 10: The Aim of the Opening 
Our two previous lessons were 
devoted to the most common 
mistakes made by inexper- 
ienced players in the early 
stages of the game. Having 
seen how not to play the 
opening, let us now try to 
figure out what it is we should 
do to get a good position from 
the very outset. 
Practically all instructions 
concerning this are contained 
in Lesson Eight, where the 
First Principle was given for 
the opening battle. The 
principle defines the most 
important development fact- 
ors which hold true, no matter 
how the opening develops. 
One must remember that the 
pieces are brought out so as to 
achieve a definite advantage in 
the middle game, which is 
when the main events will take 
place. When developing your 
pieces, it is important, 
especially for players without 
much practice, to maintain 
harmony, that is, to leave 
yourself room to manoeuvre 
without crowding your pieces. 
At the same time, you must try 
to make it more difficult for 
your opponent to do the same. 
N o  matter what the 
opening, the best moves for 
both sides are always 
subordinate to one goal - 
the 
fight for the centre. White, 
having the advantage of the 
first move, can attain this goal 
faster than Black, who does all 
he can to hinder White. Take 
the first few moves from two 
of the most complex systems 
in modern theory, the Ruy 
Lopez (1 e4 e5 2 Qf3 Qc6 3 
Ab5)

TAe Aim of the Opening 47 
and the Nimzo-Indian Defence 
(1 d4 Bf6 2 c4 e6 3 Bc3 91b4) 
It is obvious that, from the 
very outset, the fight resolves 
around respectively the 
central e5 and e4 squares. This 
is only natural, since 
domination in the centre 
(meaning not just that pawns 
occupy the centre squares, but 
that these are controlled by 
pieces) allows for creation of a 
strong-point from which to 
operate in the middle game. 
Let us try to illustrate this 
with a rather elementary 
I 
example.

This, by the way, is how 
games bet ween beginners or at 
simultaneous exhibitions 
frequently start off. Both sides 
have seemingly tried to keep 
pace in development, but 
White has clearly managed to 
develop to a greater extent. He 
has a powerful pawn centre 
and his pieces have room io 
manoeuvre. Of course, Black's 
position is far from lost, but 
why resign yourself to 
passivity from the very outset? 
We are not concerned here 
with recommending any 
specific kind of opening, but 
considering the tremendous 
popularity of the King's 
Gambit amongst inexper- 
ienced players, we might start 
by examining the methods 
behind it.

48 The Aim of the Opening 
Black has gained a pawn 
here which he can safely hold, 
and, at the same time has not 
neglected development. 
This attempt at counter- 
attack conceals many dangers 
for both sides and demands a 
good knowledge of numerous 
variations. 
From the following example, 
taken from grandmaster 
practice, we can see how 
neglecting the principles of 
opening development led to 
rapid disaster for White.

This might be a good time to

the 1938 USSR Champion- 
ship: " ... and control over the 
central squares goes over to 
Black. It gradually becomes 
clear that White has no game 
plan at all and is merely 
concerned with 'development' 
One could perhaps have got 
away with such play at the 
turn of the century, but 
nowadays, when every master 
starts putting together a 
middlegame plan beginning at 
the 6th or 8th move, there is no 
better way to get into a 
The Aim of the Opening 51 
cramped position than to 
strive merely for develop- 
ment." 
Botvinnik, of course, is 
speaking here of expert 
players, and for that reason, it 
would be frivolous at the least 
to demand a great degree of 
insight into the position from 
our readers. But I think this 
critical comment by an ex- 
world champion may be taken 
as a chess axiom valid for 
anyone who plays chess. 
Remember it and try while still 
in the opening to use every 
chance to plot out approxim- 
ately what course the game 
will subsequently take.

Lesson 11: Choice of Opening 
Having studied the previous 
lessons, you have set up your 
pieces and are thinking over 
the first move. Don't be in a 
hurry to read an opening 
manual - 
it will only lead you 
astray. Let's try to make a 
choice together. First of all, 
remember that there is no such 
thing as the 'best* or the 
'strongest' move in the initial 
position. There are several 
moves corresponding to the 
principles of development in 
chess openings, and you have 
to make a choice in accord- 
ance with your taste, know- 
ledge and experience. 
I would suggest starting the 
game with the advance of one 
of the centre pawns. Before 
becoming a grandmaster I 
liked starting the game with 1 
e4! This move reminded me of 
chivalrous gallantry and a 
readiness to engage in open 
combat. The White pawn on 
e4 controls the important d5 
square waiting for reinforce- 
ment on 64. As you can see, 
White's 
aims are straight 
forward and clear-cut, and it is 
natural that all openings 
starting with 1 e4 are referred 
to as 'open' or 'semi-open'. 
So, White has played 1 e4 .. . 
Which is the best reply for 
Black? Strange as it might 
seem, Black has a wide choice. 
The most fundamental 
reaction is undoubtedly the 
symmetrical reply with the 
Black king's pawn. 
All openings beginning with 
1 e4 e5 fall under the category 
'open' games, rich in history 
and tournament practice. 
The King's Gambit: 1 e4 e5 2 
f4 ef 3 Qf3 d5 4 d4. This 
splendid opening has dropped 
out of major tournament 
practice mostly due to the 
counter-gambit ideas enabling 
Black to fight successfully for 
initiative by playing 2 ... d5! 3 
ed e4! or 2 ... ef 3 Qf3 d5 4 ed 
Q f6.

Another attempt to remove 
the pawn from the centre -

very few supporters. As a 
result of the White queen's

56 Choice of Open~ng 
Two openings - the Caro- 
Kunn defence ( I  e4 c6 2 d4 d5) 
and the French Defence ( 1 e4 e6 
2 d4 d5) - have a similar _ 
stragetic concept. Black fights 
against the formation of the 
'ideal' pawn centre by limit~ng 
its mobility and placing a well 
protected outpost on d5. The 
most cruc~al postions In the 
Caro-Kann are as follows: 
first - 
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 Af5 
4 Qc3 e6; second - 
1 e4 c6 2 
d4 d5 3 Qc3 de 4 a x e 4  Af5 5 
Qg3 Ag6 
where White has a slight 
advantage, but there are no 
weaknesses in Black's position 
and Black's development is 
unhindered. The basic 
pos~tion in the French 
Defence - 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 
Qc3 Ab4 4 e5 c5 
leads to the posit~on wlth the 
blocked pawns on d4 and e5 
under constant threat. 
These two openlngs are 
regarded as qu~te reltable and 
lead to complex manoeuvring 
in the mlddlegarne. Those who 
like scrupulous work at the 
chessboard and who can 
patiently bide their time would 
do well to study one of these 
openings. But I personally 
prefer the Caro-Kann Defence 
w ~ t h  a free development of 
Black's pleas, whereas in the 
French Defence the black 
bishop on c8 is hemmed In by 
its own pawns.

The course of events is 
r n ~ ~ h  
slower if White starts 
the game with the advance of 
the queen's pawn - 1 d4. 
Here, after the first opening 
moves the plans for both sides 
are unclear and concealed 
from the opponent. All chess 
openings starting with 1 d4 are 
called 'closed' or 'semi- 
closed'. To play them well and 
efficiently, one must have a 
certain understanding of 
positlon and some experience. 
Therefore I adv~se you to play, 
at least for a year, 'open' 
games, and only after thls can 
you start playing 'closed' 
games. 
Analogous to 1 e4, the most 
fundamental reply to 1 d4 is 1 
... d5. And 2 c4 leads to 
different variat~ons of the 
Choice of Opening 57 
or Tarrasck Defences, Black 
will try to strengthen the 
outpost on d5, whereas Whlte 
will be methodically creating 
favourable conditions for the 
king pawn's advance to e4, In 
this century other methods of 
development, aimed at 
providing Black with less 
stra~ghtforward counterplay 
in the centre, have evolved. In

Black permits White to build

And that is the end of our 
short outline of the basicchess 
openings. When you read one 
of the numerous chess 
manuals available, don't be 
confused by the multitude of 
-~ariations you may come 
across. They reflect all that 
might be of importance in 
tournament practice, in other 
words, the basic laws of 
opening strategy. We have 
already dwelt upon it, and it is 
a must for the beginner.

7- 
Lesson 12: The Art of Planning 
Before embarking on an 
activity, almost every person, 
in order to achieve his object, 
contemplates what operations 
he will have to perform and 
figures out the best sequence 
for these operations. 
I firmly believe that chess is, 
to a certain extent, a model of 
life, and therefore planning is 
an essential feature of this 
game. 
What is planning in a chess 
game? It is a well-considered 
order of operations aimed at 
achieving a definite and 
concrete objective, the order 
taking into account the 
situation on the chessboard 
and constantly modified by 
the opponent's actions. 
I 
The plan should not be 
confused with the object of the 
game. Some amateur may say 
'1 want to checkmate, 
therefore I play for a mate 
from the very start. So I play 
according to a plan.' This is an 
utterly wrong approach. In the 
initial position there are no 
real conditions for mating the 
opponent's king. The mate is 
the ultimate and most desired 
object of the game, and 'play 
for mate from the first move' is 
a wish to satisfy this desire. 
Firstly, you develop your 
pieces according to a certain 
pattern 
to achieve some 
superiority in a certain area of 
the chessboard. 
Then you increase your 
pressure in order to obtain 
concrete positional or 
material advantages in the 
middlegame. 
And finally, you carefully 
exploit all your advantages in 
the endgame, obtaining a 
material superiority that 
renders any resistance 
impossible. 
The defending side does not 
play in a free-wheeling fashion 
either; he also plays according 
to a plan, taking into account 
alI dangers, threats and 
weaknesses in his camp and 
trying above all to get rid of 
the weaknesses.

- 
60 The Arf of Planning 
The plan is built up on the 
- 
basis of a concrete evaluation 
of the position and its 
. 
peculiarities. Therefore, it is 
important to be able to analyse 
the fighting formations of both 
sides and to understand all the 
subtleties of the position. The 
ability to build up a plan 
and to carry it out consistently 
on the board is one of the most 
attractive aspects of chess; 
sometimes it is more gratifying 
than, say, a direct attack on 
the enemy's king. And if you 
remember that quite often 
chess players camouflage their 
intentions by employing 
distracting manoeuvres, you 
wiH understand that playing 
according to plan is a great art. 
Of course, it takes a long 
time to learn your operations 
at the chessboard. Serious and 
small mistakes are inevitable. 
But to my mind it is better to 
learn from your mistakes than 
to do without any plan 
whatsoever. 
To illustrate this, let us 
consider t h e  following 
examples. 
A.Suetik1 .Bondarevsky 
Moscow 1963 
This is one of the oldest 
variations of the Ruy Lopez. 
Having completed the first 
half of the plan in the opening 
(evacuation of the king from 
the centre), White is planning 
to create a pawn centre by 
continuing c2-c3 and d2-d4 
and exerting pressure on the e5 
pawn. Black ordinarily tries to 
hold the outpost on e5 by 
playing Qg8-e7-g6 followed 
by Ae7. It is also possible to 
build up another defensive 
formation: .. . Qg8-e7, ... g6, ... 
Ag7. Both sides seem to be 
ready for slow positional man- 
oeuvring. Suddenly Black 
makes an impulsive anti- 
positional move.

Energetic actions in the 
centre should be regarded as 
the best reaction to Black's 
premature kingside escapade 
The best way to exploit 
effectively Black's 
slow 
development is to open up the 
centre. White's 6th move is a 
good example of timely 
correction of the previously 
envisaged plan prompted by 
the hazardous actions of the 
adversary.

in the centre.

Here is another example 
from the game between 
Svetozar Gligoric and Vasily 
Smyslov. 
In addition to the extra 
pawn which can be exploited 
only in the ending, Black's 
chief advantage lies in the 
control of a number of squares 
in the centre: d4, d5, c5, f4 and 
f5. White has his counter- 
chances: the pawn majority on

as a result of superficial play, 
have ended in the draw! But 
Smyslov is a great expert on 
such endgames. His winning 
plan comprises three basic 
stages. 
The first stage is the 
immediate exchange of one 
pair of rooks so as to prevent 
penetration on the d-file. The 
other rook should be 
preserved to combat the 
eventual advance of White's 
queenside pawns.

What is the best method of 
planning a chess game? 
Presumably, by analysing 
grandmasters' annotations 
where particular emphasis is 
placed on the logical sequence 
of operations to achieve the 
ultimate objective. 
The annotations to their 
games by top ranking chess 
players will be highly 
beneficial for all lovers of 
chess keen on improving their 
game.

Lesson 13: Forcing Continuations 
For most enthusiasts chess is 
a game sparkling 
with impetuous attacks and 
combinational fireworks. 
Everyone is keen on attacking 
and creating beautiful 
combinations, but very few 
are enchanted by the genuine 
beauty of subtle positional 
manoeuvres and profound 
strategic plans. 
The art of positional play is 
not duly appreciated by the 
rank-and-file who often fail to 
understand why grandmasters 
are so good at carrying out 
beautiful and effective attacks. 
Many amateurs can solve, no 
worse than well-known 
masters, problems and 
studies. And only upon 
plunging seriously into the 
intricacies of the game do they 
realize that the opportunities 
for effective attacks and 
combinations are not, as a 
rule, spontaneous, but they 
result from positional play 
based on the observance of the 
laws of chess strategy. 
Therefore those who want to 
succeed in chess should realise 
that combinative and posit- 
ional play do not oppose but 
rather complement each 
other. 
I 
like attacking and 
sacrificing, but nevertheless I 
am firmly convinced that 
positional play is the basis of 
chess, reflecting the inner logic 
of the chess struggle and more 
i n  k e e p i n g  w i t h  t h e  
requirements of the modern 
game. 
The basis of positional play 
is the plan we dwelt upon in 
some detail in our previous 
lesson. Forming a deep and 
efficient ('correct') plan 
requires as much imagination 
and versatility as calculating 
an intricate chess combinat- 
ion. If the idea of a 
combination has been found, 
then the calculation of the 
moves is a matter of time and 
technique. The moves 
frequently assume a forced 
character; they become

66 Forcing Continuations 
realistic and concrete. 
In formulating a plan one 
has to consider the positions 
which may be encountered a 
few moves later. The concrete 
calculation of variations often 
gives away to semi-abstract 
speculations and assumptions 
about the likely resultant 
positions. The ability to play 
'according to the position', or 
'positionally', is important in 
complex and abstract 
situations when the target of 
the attack is not yet clear and 
one has to manoeuvre in order 
to consolidate one's pieces and 
discover a weak point in the 
enemy camp. 
The mere mention of the 
name of Paul Morphy, the 
brilliant American chess 
player of the 19th century, 
makes many lovers of chess 
remember his outstanding 
attacks and combinations. 
However, very few know that 
these combinations were 
based on profound strategic 
principles such as maximum 
centralisation of the pieces, 
superiority in development, 
and opening of files in the 
centre. Morphy intuitively 
understood the laws of chess 
strategy and, owing to this, he 
scored a great number of 
brilliant victories. 
The great chess thinker of 
the end of the 19th century, the 
first official world champion 
Wilhelm Steinitz was the first 
to formulate the basic laws of 
positional play (strategy). He 
showed that a plan cannot be 
inspired by the player' 
imagination. It should rely on 
something concrete hidden in 
the position on the chessboard 
at a particular moment. He 
demonstrated that each 
position on the chessboard is 
characterised by various 
factors, favourable or 
unfavourable for each side, 
which should be analysed both 
separately and together so 
as to evaluate the position. 
This evaluation will be helpful 
in formulating a plan taking 
into account the real 
possibilities of both sides. 
The ability to evaluate 
properly the situation at any 
moment of 
t h e  game 
determines, to a great extent, 
the strength of the chess 
player. 
Let us consider a simple 
example. 
I .Boleslrrvsky-A,Kotov 
Zurich 1953 
.

Forcing Conrinuarions 6 7 
At first glance, the chances 
are unclear here - 
White has 
an extra pawn, but his 
queenside pawns are weak and 
Black's 
two long-range 
bishops are likely to give Black 
sufficient counterplay to 
achieve equality. The trouble 
is that the bishop on d6 is 
pinned. To free himself, Black 
has to play for simplifications, 
hoping to secure a draw in the 
ending with opposite coloured 
bishops. Alas, there is a small 
drawback in this evaluation of 
the position leading, 7 moves 
later, to Black's loss.

If Black could exchange 
knights, the draw would be 
obvious, even if he let the 
White king into the centre and 
gave up the a6-pawn. But this 
is impossible. It is easy to see 
that White's bishop is ready to 
capture Black's knight if it 
moves. So, the ending with the 
opposite-coloured bishops 
does not save Black and the 
White king will take the 
shortest way to the queenside, 
after which Black's pawns are 
sure to fall. This elementary 
example shows that White 
managed to exploit his 
advantage so easily because 
among numerous middle- 
game positions he saw the best 
one arising after 25 Ae5! and 
26 b4! after which the 
calculation of variations was 
quite easy. 
, To evaluate the position

68 Forcing Conrinuations 
correctly, one should be able 
to analyse the disposition of 
the pieces, their centralisation, 
the quality of pawn structure, 
mobility, the availability of 
open lines, and the material 
relationships of the pieces. 
The depth and subtlety of the 
general evaluation of the 
position depends on the 
concrete estimation of each of 
the above-mentioned factors 
in any given position. 
For example, it is common 
knowledge that a rook is 
stronger than a knight, but if 
the knight occupies a well- 
protected outpost in the centre 
of the board while the rook is 
completely out of the action, 
then the knight is obviously 
superior to the rook. 
In the endgame the 
evaluation of the position is 
usually determined by the 
possession of passed pawns 
and centralisation of the king. 
In the middlegame, on the 
other hand, the king should be 
kept away from the centre. 
An experienced chess player 
respects the art of positional 
play because he appreciates 
the benefit of the systematic 
accumulation of small 
positional 'pluses' providing, 
in the final analysis, the so- 
called positional advantage 
for one of the sides. The player 
having the positional 
advantage is in charge of the 
situation. Suddenly he 
discovers a great wealth of 
different possibilities for his 
pieces and a good choice of 
combinational and positional 
continuations. 
If you take ten beautiful 
attacking combinations ofany 
grandmaster and try to 
evaluate the initial positions, 
you will see that these 
combinations were based on 
positional superiority, for 
example superiority in 
development or superior 
mobility of the pieces. 
In the past 100 years 
profound chess analysts have 
unravelled many mysteries in 
the theory of positional play. 
The basic laws of chess 
strategy formulated by the 
great Steinitz have remained 
u n c h a n g e d ,  b u t  m o r e  
emphasis is being placed now 
on such factors as dynamics of 
the position, compensation 
for some positional drawbacks 
('minuses') by some advant- 
ages ('pluses'). More import- 
ance is being attached now to

the co-ordination of the pieces 
since two or three well co- 
ordinated pieces can truimph 
over enemy pieces superior in 
force but less mobile. 
And finally, whereas 150 
years ago combinations were 
aimed ultimately at seizing the 
king's fortress, nowadays, 
with the progress of defensive 
technique, complex combinat- 
ions are carried out to increase 
Forcing Conrinuutions 69 
positiond gains. 'Positional 
sacrifice' of chess material has 
become one of the most 
effective techniques when 
pawns and pieces are sacrifced 
to achieve substantial (but not 
decisive) positional gains. 
In conclusion, I would like 
to advise all lovers of chess to 
study more persistently the art 
of positional play. I assure you 
you won't regret it!

Lesson 14 Queen Sacrifices 
So long as a chess game 
develops steadily in accord- 
ance with the laws of strategy, 
the traditional hierarchical 
value of chess pieces is 
preserved. One can, of course, 
argue about which is stronger 
- 
the rook or the bishop and 
two pawns - depending on 
the position occupied by these 
pieces. But sometimes chess 
pieces acquire supernatural 
strength and begin performing 
miracles. AII our traditional 
values are exploded: for 
instance, a pawn becomes 
stronger than a rook or even a 
queen. This happens most fre- 
quently when a well thought- 
out combination is imple- 
mented on the chess board. 
It is a well known fact that 
combinational play appeals to 
chess enthusiasts. Why? First 
of 
all, by its beauty, 
unexpectedness and inexor- 
able logic, for in the course of 
the combination the opponent 
usually makes forced moves. 
This is one of the most astan- 
ishing paradoxes of chess, 
When a struggle is in progress, 
each side can choose from 
several possible moves. But 
combinative complications 
violating normal material 
values strictly limit the ways in 
which the game can develop, 
and what is ore, the opponent 
has no choice of moves. 
Let us analyse a game 
between Edward Lasker and 
George Thomas played in 
I9 1 I. It deveIoped quietly at

Beautiful? Yes! Unexpect- 
ed! Yes! Forced? Yes! But why 
is it so sudden? How can the 
combination be foreseen and 
found? An experienced chess 
player k n o w s  t h a t  a 
combination never starts from 
scratch. To make a combinat- 
ion feasible, one must have 
certain advantages which are 
accumulated gradually, move 
after move. The accumulative 
process may substantially 
accelerate the opponent's 
mistakes. 
What made the queen 
sacrifice in the game analysed 
above possible? White did not 
have the advantage in 
development, but his four

72 Queen Sacrifices 
minor pieces were aimed at the 
Black king and the weak h7- 
square. The absence of the 
Black pawn on f7 created the 
preconditions for the mating 
position: White's knights on f6 
and g6, Black king on h8 and 
Black's pawn on g7. This is a 
typical position. 
The knowledge of such 
positions is essential for any 
chessplayer. There are many 
positions of this kind and it is 
quite easy to remember them. 
Therefore in a labyrinth of 
combinations one must be 
able to see the elements of 
elementary mating positions. 
Let us analyse a position from 
a game between G .  Rotlevi 
and A. Rubinstein played in 
1908.

Combinations like these are 
unforgettable. 
How do they arise? What is 
their essence? We shall devote 
a few lessons to these 
questions. Now we are going 
to specify the conditions 
necessary far carrying out 
combinations. 
A combination, as has been 
stated, does not occur at a

Queen Sacrifices 73 
predetermined m o m e n t  
during the game. The idea for 
a combination may appear 
when the situation on the 
chessboard is characterissd by 
cettain specific features. They 
suggest the motif of the 
combinational explosion. 
Such specific features incl- 
ude, for example, weakness of 
the first (White) or eighth 
I 
(Black) rank which makes it 
2 
Wc4!! #d7 
possible for enemy pieces to 
penetrate the king's camp. If 
that happens, the defending 
side, in order to avoid being 
checkmated immediately, 
must accept heavy losses and 
the subsequent struggle 
becomes pointless. 
A classic example is 
provided by the game between 
Edward Adarns and Carlos 
Torre in 1920.

because of 6 Pxe4 and the 
White queen is taboo. So the 
queen has to retreat. 
This sacrifice is decisive. 
The Black queen can no longer 
stay on the a4-e8 diagonal. 
Black has to admit defeat. 
In our next lesson we shall 
continue our consideration of 
the conditions which are 
necessary if attacking 
combinations are to be carried 
out during a game.

Lesson 15: Tactical Devices 
In our last lesson we dealt with 
and how they 
occur in practical games. We 
also analysed some attacking 
based on the 
weakness of the first (or 
eighth) rank. 
Now we art: 
going to examine other 
specific situations giving rise 
to various combinations. 
Firstly we look at the 
weakness of the second 
(seventh) rank. 
The weakness of the back 
rank leads to mating threats 
against the White king. The 
weakness of the second or 
seventh rank most often leads 
to the destruction of the king's 
pawn protection thereby 
facilitating ultimate victory. 
In Lesson 14 we considered 
the game between G. Rotlevi 
and A. Rubinstein in which 
White capitulated because of 
the weakness of the second 
rank when both Black's rooks 
created threats to h2. Let us 
consider an analogous 
situation which was reached in 
the game Carlos Torre vs 
Emanuel Lasker (Moscow 
19251. 
It seems that Black may be 
happy with his position but an 
unexpected and brilliant 
sacrifice of White's bishop 
drastically changes t h e  
situation, making it possible 
to carry out a combination 
which in chess is called a 
'windmill'.

ruction of the king's pawn

ensured his quick victory. 
1n conclusion, let us 
consider a classical example of 
brilliant combinational play in 
which another tactical device 
- 'deflection' - was used. 
While carrying out an attack it 
is often necessary to dispose of 
, 
one of the enemy pieces 
protecting one or several 
important squares. The most 
simple way, i.e., destruction or 
exchange, is not always 
possible, and then the 
question arises as to whether it 
is possible to deflect the enemy 
piece by means of a tactical 
blow. A hundred years ago 
Johannes Zukertort 
was 
famousas a master of brilliant 
combinations. Here is his 
spectacular victory against 
J.H. Blackburne. 
Black has just refused to 
take the pawn on f5 and by 
placing the rook on c8 he 
threatens to invade on c2. 
White, in his turn, has an 
attacking chance: 1 d5 Ec2 2

to capture on b2. However, 
White chose a more complex 
and beautiful way of resolving 
the conflict.

Lesson 16: The Endgame 
. ,  
Manv lovers of chess look with 
disdain on the endgame, the 
final stage of the game, as a 
boring area which does not 
require any combinational 
imagination. Later on we shall 
examine playing the endgame, 
and you will see that this stage 
of the game is extremely 
complex and abundant in 
original ideas. However, 
we are now going to make an 
attempt at convincing the 
readers that combinational 
abilities and skills are quite 
essential for success in the 
endgame. 
During a combination in 
the middlegame or in the 
opening most of the pawns 
and pieces are just passive 
observers. An endgame com- 
bination, however, requires 
the participation of practically 
all pieces, and the king is the 
most active piece. Let us see a 
very simple example: 
see fo/lowing diagram 
White is to move, and the 
first impulse is to advance the 
h-pawn but after 1 h7 e4! there 
isn't 
any likelihood of 
promoting the White pawn 
since all the squares on the 
long diagonal are controlled 
by the Black bishop. 
So, before advancing the 
pawn White should either 
drive away the Bishop from 
the long diagonal or block the 
advance of the e-pawn. Let's 
try the first variant.

endgame combinations: 
the active role of the king and 
the ever increasing value of 
passed pawns. 
Here is another example:

White looks like an act of

Lesson 17: Methods of Attack 
Every chess player, regardless 
of his qualification (there are 
of amateur players), 
feel an upsurge of inspiration 
when a position is reached in 
which he can launch an attack 
against the enemy king. But to 
organise an attack, one must 
acquire the skills of positional 
play and the knowledge of 
combinational blows covered 
in our previous lessons. 
In most games, one side, by 
gradually accumulating minor 
positional pluses, obtains a so- 
called positional advantage 
which has to be converted into 
some real material advantage. 
In such situations the best way 
is to proceed from slow and 
purposeful manoeuvres to 
energetic actions characterised 
by offensive operations and 
constant concrete tactical 
blows. 
This method of chess 
strategy is called the attack. 
There are many types of 
attacks, for instance, lightning 
- 
attacks, requiring two or three 
moves to decide the game, or 
mul ti-stage attacks, some- 
times ten or moves long. Most 
often the enemy king is the 
target of the attack. The 
attacking pieces try all 
possible means to crush the 
king even at the expense of 
heavy material losses. In such 
cases the end, as a rule, 
justifies the means. 
To illustrate such attacks, I 
should like to analyse two 
games. First, let us look at one 
of my games.

As a result of the incorrect 
manoeuvre of White's knight 
to d4, White's 
king has 
become stuck in the centre, 
and his kingside pieces have 
not 
yet 
been developed. 
Therefore, the first stage of the 
attack lies in a pawn sacrifice, 
opening the long diagonal for 
the bishop and the central file 
for the rook.

for the sacrificed bishop. 
Nevertheless, Black should be 
very energetic while conduct- 
ing the attack.

Another stage of the attack 
is over. Black has deployed all 
his pieces and paralysed the 
forces. Now he 
could have re-established the 
material equilibrum by 
capturing the rook. However, 
Black is in no hurry for this, 
seeing that White's pieces 
surrounding their own king 
block his escape from the 
centre. 
26 *el? 
The natural desire to keep 
the queen closer to the theatre 
of operations brings White to 
the precipice and deprives his 
king of manoeuvrability. The 
only defensive resource was to 
transfer the queen to g4. By 
playing 26 Wa4! White could 
have avoided immediate 
defeat, though after 26 ...

Wxg4 29 kxg4 f5 30 Af3 g5 it

White's positional advant-

and, what is more, by Black's 
inferior development in that 
sector. However, Alekhine 
notices another pecularity of 
this position - 
the insufficient 
protection of Black's kingside, 
which enables him to launch 
an attack against the king. But

Lesson 18: Attack or Defence? 
Which is more important - 
attack or defence? In present 
day chess this question is 
extremely topical, and every 
chess player tackles it his own 
way. Impetuous and inexper- 
ienced players are usually keen 
on clinching the issue by a 
direct attack. Lured by the 
lustre of combinations, they 
persistently look for beautiful 
and unexpected tactical blows. 
Most experienced chess play- 
ers prefer strongly protected 
formations capable of repell- 
ing any attack. 
Chess fans know that the 
attacking or the so-called 
romantic style was predomin- 
ant in the 19th century. At that 
time intricate methods of 
defence were non-existent. If 
your opponent sacrificed a 
pawn or a piece, you were 
supposed t o  accept the 
sacrifice and fight back 
afterwards. It was only at the 
close of the century, when the 
great chess philosopher 
Wilhtlm Steinitz formulated 
his theory of positional play 
and world champion Emanuel 
Lasker achieved outstanding 
results, that defence came to 
be appreciated and new chess 
masters extremely skilful in 
the art of defence appeared in 
the chess arena, 
How is this problem viewed 
today? The answer is clear: 
both the shield and the sword 
are equally important. It is 
obvious today that one cannot 
become a strong player with- 
out being a skilful defender. 
Some 20 years ago intuitive 
sacrifices in order to seize the 
initiative were common 
practice in international 
tournaments. Nowadays 
defensive technique bas 
enhanced to such an extent 
that 
even a minor pawn 
sacrifice should be based on 
concrete variations, otherwise 
the defence will take the upper 
hand. 
Why do we look back into 
history? The answer is quite 
simple: any chess player

Artack or Defence? 91 
wishing to improve his skills 
has to accumulate the exper- 
ience of previous generations. 
Our forerunners, lacking in 
knowledge, used the trial 
and error method and left us 
their chess wisdom in their 
games and books. What took 
them decades of laborious 
work is now acquired by a 
young chess player within a 
year. 
So, how does one learn to 
set up a good defence? There 
are many ways and methods. 
We shall get acquainted with 
them in our lessons. 
Let us begin with bad 
positions. Lasker used to say 
that any position could be 
defended and everyone knows 
the popular chess proverb: 
'It's never too late to resign'. 
Experience has shown that no 
matter how hopeless a 
position is some chance 
always crops up for puttingup 
stubborn resistance. You must 
find such a chance. When your 
opponent, anticipating an 
easy win, encounters new 
Problems and difficulties, he 
may, owing to fatigue, make a 
mistake and victory will slip 
away from him. Of course, if 
both sides play well in this 
situation, a bad position, 
whatever the defence, will still 
remain bad. 
But you should do your best 
and play to the bitter end. Just 
look how Lasker did it. 
Em,Lasker-A.Nimzowimh 
St. Petersburg 1914 
Black has an extra pawn, a 
well positioned knight in the 
centre and a strong pawn 
structure. Very few could have 
put up a stubborn defence 
here. But the great Lasker, 
noticing that Black's knight 
could be exchanged and the 
extra pawn was still doubled, 
r e a l i s e d  t h a t  Black's 
advantage, although it was 
obvious, was not yet decisive. 
Black still has to figure out 
how to improve his position, 
so White should wait quietly 
and play non-committally.

The great Cuban chess 
player Jose Raoul Capablanca 
lost very few games through-

excellent defender.

versatile and subtle. And, this, 
in its turn, has caused a 
reciprocal reaction; in other 
words, the sharpening of the 
sword has gone hand in hand 
with the strengthening of the 
shield. 
To begin with, the role of 
active defence aimed at 
creating counter threats has 
considerably increased. 
I was lucky to meet on many 
occasions Tigran Petrosian 
whose death was tragically 
premature. He lavishly shared 
his invaluable experience with 
me, and the chess encounters 
with this phenomenal master 
of defence were extremely 
I 
useful for me. For instance. it 
I 
took me a long time to 
understand why my seemingly 
irresistible attack had been 
frustrated in our game at the 
super-tournament in Tilburg 
in 1981. 
G .Kasparov-T.Petrosian 
Tilburg 1981 
Having sacrificed a pawn in 
the opening, I managed to 
cramp Black's pieces. Besides, 
it's obvious that Black's king 
is actually misplaced. The 
threat is a4-a5, and it's not 
clear how to repel Pcb2 and 
Wb I. The cramped position of 
Black's pieces makes his 
defence passive and absolutely

unpromising and therefore 
Petrosian resorts to a desper- 
ate move.

The impression is that Black 
is on the edge of the precipice, 
the destruction of his queen- 
side down the open files seems 
inevitable. However, from 
now on Tigran Petrosian finds 
moves that turn the whole 
game into a display of magic.

Most masters would have 
preferred 32 ... Ad6, giving up 
the pawn with an inferior 
position - 33 Bxb5 Rxb5 34 
Qxd6 Wxd6 35 Wxb5 - but 
avoiding a catastrophe. 
Escaping from one pin, 
Black falls under another two 
pins. I really don't know how 
my highly esteemed opponent 
determined that his king 
would be safe on b7, but his 
decision had an unexpected 
psychological effect on me. I 
could still appreciate the 
attacking power of my pieces, 
but after this unexpected move 
I really became muddled.

Strange as it may seem, this 
apparently natural and 
supercharged move turns out 
to be a serious error. I was 
perfectly aware that d5 was 
Black's foothold, but I didn't 
see any way of gaining it.

Here, for the first time in 
this game, I experienced vague 
fears over the outcome of the 
attack, and I decided just to 
develop my pieces occupying 
vantage points and hoping to 
inflict a serious combinational 
blow on the enemy. However, 
the former world champion's 
next move caught me

completely unawares.

Fantastic!! The king, 
leaving the pawn cover, 
marches towards White's 
army. This is not recklessness, 
but an example of precise 
calculation. Now White has to 
find a way of saving his 
muddled pieces without 
material losses. There was 
salvation here, but, alas, being 
astounded by the fantastically 
resourceful defence of my 
opponent, I failed to find the 
best continuation and lost the 
game in a few moves.

So, the king not only

this game, you 
should draw the most 
important conclusion: you 
should be cold-blooded and 
clear-headed when attacked 
by your opponent. Then you 
will be able to repel the attack 
successfully and choose the 
appropriate moment for 
launching a counterattack 
which, in the final analysis, is 
the most efficient method of 
defence. 
Now let's analyse the 
classical example of counter- 
attack in a brilliant game 
between two chess giants. 
Y .Geller-M.Euwe

White's attack looks 
White resigned 
threatening. In a couple of

98 Counterattack 
moves he can bring his queen 
and rook to the h-file, so that 
practically all his pieces 
(except the rook on af) will 
participate in the onslaught 
against the Black king's 
fortress. But former world 
champion Euwe had played 
over 70 games against the 
greatest magician of attack, 
Alexander Alekhine, so it was 
not easy to embarrass him. 
16 ...

This isn't a waste of time, 
but the beginning of a 
remarkable plan. The passive 
defence of the king's fortress is 
unpromising for Black, since 
his pieces have Iittle, if any, 
scope for manoeuvre and half 
of them will not be able to 
protect the king. In view of 
this, Euwe decides to react, as 
soon as possible, with strong 
counterplay in the centre, 
where his pieces are no worse 
posted than White's.

Black has exchanged the 
dangerous light-squared bis- 
hop and opened up the long 
diagonal for his bishop 
controlling the vitally import- 
ant g2-square. Nevertheless, it 
seems that White is obviously 
better: his queen will soon be 
in the midst of the enemy 
camp.

Black's position looks 
critical. If White brings his 
rook from a1 to fl, there will 
be immediate threats to the 
Black king. But it is at this 
juncture that Euwe finds a 
stunning tactical blow based 
on 'deflection' and carries out 
a lightning counterattack.

actualty it was only his queen 
that bothered Black's king; the 
other pieces were merely 
observers. On the other hand 
several of Black's pieces 
participated in the counter- 
attack against g2. Euwe was 
successful because he 
defended with a minimum of 
forces, It was this type of 
'economical' defence which 
the great Lasker found to be 
the surest sign of a top-class 
chess player. 
So, when on the defensive, 
maintain your poise, When 
you spot the enemy's threat, 
don't rush all your pieces into 
defence, use your pieces 
economically and choose the 
right moment for wunter- 
attack,

Lesson 20: The Opposition 
For most enthusiasts chess is 
primarily a game with a mult- 
itude of possibilities for carry- 
ing out unexpected and beaut- 
iful combinations. They 
believe that the fewer pieces 
that remain on the chess- 
board, the less interesting the 
game. And to most of them the 
endgame is reminiscent of a 
gloomy, barren wilderness. 
What an illusion! 
The endgame, the final part 
of the game of chess, is 
inexhaustibly rich for chess 
players endowed w i t h  
creative, original thinking and 
capable of carrying out 
profound, 'long-range' ideas. 
This phase of the game 
requires clockwork precision. 
If you are not happy about the 
opening, you can impr0v.e 
y o u r  position i n  t h e  
middlegame; if you have made 
some mistakes in the 
middlegame, you may hope to 
correct them in the ending. 
But endgame errors, like a 
goalkeeper's mistake in 
- 
- 
fcmtball, are, as a rule, terminal. 
Remember: unless you can 
play the endgame, you wilt 
never be a strong chess player. 
It is not by chance that all 
the world champions were 
always willing to transpose the 
game into the ending and they 
could play this stage of the 
game with great strength and 
artistry. Emanuel Lasker, Jose 
Raoul Capablanca and 
Mikhail Botvinnik were 
endgame virtuosi. 
I cannot overestimate the 
value of lessons on the 
endgame technique given to 
me by the former world 
champion Mikhail Botvinnik. 
Ten years ago he convinced 
me of the necessity to study 
typical endgame positions and 
methods. 
The great Capablanca 
advised starting with the most 
elementary pawn endings. 
Why? It seems that there is 
very little chance of arriving at 
such positions. If I had shown 
such naive pragmatism in 197%

The Opposition 102 
at the Daugavpils qualifying 
tournament at the national 
championship, I would have 
come to grief. At the end of the 
tournament, in my game 
against Alburt (I was Black) 
the following position was 
reached after White's 45th 
move: 
At this moment many 
spectators argued whether 
Black could win this game. 
Sitting at the chessboard, I 
was checking the well-known 
winning method. First of all, 
Black must get a passed pawn 
by threatening to get around 
White's king from the flank: 
45 ... 
*d5 
46 &d3

47 &c3 
White has no choice. 
47 
*, 
g4! 
48 &d3

At first glance it seems that 
Black's king cannot make 
headway because of stalemate 
after 54 ... &f4 55 &12 47e4 56 
&fl he3 57 &el f2+ 58 &gl 
47f3. But I knew that this was 
not so. In this position it is 
necessary to concede the move 
to White, so as to create a 
'zugzwang*, a position with no 
useful moves. This is achieved 
by the distant opposition of 
the kings. Now it's time to 
explain what the term 
bopposition' means and how it 
can be practically used. 
Success in a pawn ending 
depends on the activity of the 
king. The king must strive to 
gain as much space as

102 The Opposition 
possible, driving back the 
enemy king. Therefore, the 
king must advance in front of 
the pawns. In the fight for 
space on the chessboard one 
should be able to exploit the 
opposition of the kings. The 
most effective method is the 
so-called close opposition. Let 
us consider an elementary 
example. 
B o t h  
kings a r e  i n  
opposition. The one who has 
made the last move profits by 
the opposition, If White is to 
move now, he cannot stop the 
passed pawn: i &g2 &e3! 2 
&fl f4 3 &el f3 4 &fl f2 5 
&g2 G7e2 etc. If Black is to 
move now, he cannot oust the 
White king and has to 
reconcile himself to a draw 
after 1 ... &e4 2 &e2! f4 3 F$d 
t3 4 *ff! &e3 5 &el t2+ 6 
&€I h f 3  stalemate. 
The distant opposition, 
when the kings are separated 
by three ranks, is a subtle 
method leading, in the final .- 
analysis, to a close or direct 
opposition. 
Let us return to my 1978 
ending after 54 &f 1

so

It is interesting that five 
years later at the international 
tournament in the Yugoslav 
town of NiksiC I happened to 
win a game using a similar

It is clear that Black's king 
can advance to the kingside

Lesson 21: Attack h tk En- 
In our previous lesson we 
made a thorough study of the 
basic principles and methods 
of endgame technique. I 
would like to remind the 
readers of one of the most 
important rules chess players 
should be guided by in pawn 
endings. The king must strive 
to conquer as much space as 
possible, d r i v i n g  t h e  
opponent's king back from the 
centre. 
Now that we have a great 
number of endgame manuals 
and reference books, all we 
need 1s the desire and time to 
study chess endings. Opening 
positions have been studied so 
profoundly and systematically 
that even in the opening one 
should foresee all the pecul- 
iarities of possible endgame 
positions. 
The most elementary 
example can be drawn from 
the Caro-Kann Defence: 1 e4 
c6 2 d4 d5 3 Qc3 ed 4 Qxe4 
Qf6 5 Qxf6+ ef when in 
return for the open central 
files and the strengthening of 
the shelter around his king 
Black risks an inferior ending. 
In this lesson we shall 
consider the methods 
employed in endings with 
opposite-coloured bishops. 
Games with opposite coloured 
bishops quite frequently end 
in a draw, even though one of 
the sides may have two extra 
pawns. The situation is 
different, however, when, in 
addition to the opposite 
coloured bishops, rooks 
remain on the board. If that is 
the case, an important 
advantage can be secured by 
positioning the pieces more

106 Attack in the Endgame

Black's position is really 
quite difficult. His king is, 
figuratively speaking, in a 
cage, hemmed in by White's 
bishop and pawn on h5. 
Black's rook has to remain on 
the seventh rank guarding c7. 
After 39 &e3! gh 40 gh I could 
have avoided unnecessary 
adventures in a time scramble 
and I would have probably 
found an easy win in my 
analysis at home. 
Now I can think how I could 
have won this game, how 
Black's position could have 
been penetrated. Black's rook 
controls c7. Black's bishop 
keeps an eye on c8 and the b6- 
pawn guards c5. This pawn 
should be done away with by 
all means. To achieve this, 
White places his pawns on a4 
and b5 and his king goes to d4. 
After the rook exchange the 
bishop captures the pawn on 
b6. The whole operation 
would be crowned by the 
White king's penetration into 
the queenside and the b5- 
pawn queening. But I found 
this solution easily at home 
when, upset by the draw, I sat 
down to analyse the game.

Of 
course my opponent was 
surprised and glad, but I did 
not want to continue the game 
since I had been brought up to 
believe in the axiom; endings 
with opposite coloured bish- 
ops end in draws. 
Now, even in the final 
position I could have played to 
win by exploiting the passivity 
of Black's pieces. For exam-

This last move cuts off

Now White would have played 
e3, b3 and a4, and the outcome 
of the game would have 
depended on whether White's 
rook could penetrate the 
Black position. 
It is common knowledge 
that chess players learn from 
their mistakes. I would like to 
add a few words to this 
undoubtedly correct state- 
ment. Apart from studying the 
reasons you lost, you should 
study the situations in which 
you could have improved your 
position, but missed the best 
continuation. These missed 
opportunities in drawish or 
winning positions should be 
regarded as your losses. 
Therefore, it is necessary to 
analyse your mistakes over 
and over again regardless of 
Attack in the Endgame 107 
the outcome of the encounter, 
Having analysed the game 
against Florin Gheorghiu I 
got rid of my naivete in 
assessing endgame positions. 
One year later, playing 
against the Danish Grand- 
master Bent Larsen (I was 
playing Black) I got a better 
ending with few pieces left on 
the chessboard. 
At first glance it would seem 
that Black has no problems in 
winning. His rook is on the 
seventh rank. White's pawns 
e5 and g3 are very weak. But 
there are very few pieces left 
on the chessboard. Larsen 
made a strong move 
41 h5! 
causing further exchanges. 
But, as is well known, only 
mating moves are devoid of 
drawbacks. White achieves 
simplification but permits

Black to bring his king into 
play. The king is now ready to 
attack his opponent! Of 
course! One can easily come 
under attack even in the

In our previous lesson we

studying the principles of 
endgame technique and 
perfecting these skills in 
practical endings. By giving 
you examples from games I've 
played I tried to convince you 
to look for chances in any 
ending. After analysing 
concrete examples with me. a 
chess enthusiast will agree that 
even in case of material

pieces left on the board, it is

One method of defence in the

Another brilliant fortress

So White has two extra

opposite-coloured bishops are 
quite peculiar (we encounter- 
ed one in our previous lesson) 
and sometimes a material 
advantage does not ensure 
victory. Black embarks on 
building up a fortress and he is 
quite successful at first.

Actually, the fortress has

been built, but it is necessary 
1 
to know its exact dimensions.

Black's idea is quite simple: 
White's queenside pawns 
cannot advance without the 
White king's assistance. 
Occupying b6, White's king 
will not be able to move 
forward if Black's king is on 
d7. If, however, White's king 
occupies c5, then Black's king 
must be posted on e6. And if 
White's king stays in place, 
what is the best square for 
Black's king? Those who have 
f o l l o w e d  our analysis 
attentively will undoubtedly 
answer: 'On f5!'. No doubt the 
Canadian master saw 9 ...

4x8 etc. However, Yanofsky 
decided that the king should 
not necessarily move to the 
kingside because White was 
unable to organise a pawn 
breakthrough there. This was 
his fatal mistake!

I I2 Fortresses on the Chessboard 
At first glance, White has 
not improved his position, and 
after 18 b6 Aa8 his king 
cannot make headway to the 
queenside.

Now it has become clear 
that the apparently beautiful 
fortress is going to pieces as a 
result of the careless 9 ... Ag2.

Let us analyse another 
ending with opposite- 
coloured bishops. In such 
positions the superior side 
should try to create passed 
pawns on both flanks, If it is 
possible, the king will assist 
one of the pawns, and victory 
will be ensured. Let us 
consider an elementary 
example illustrating another 
method of destroying chess 
fortresses. 
Black has two extra pawns, 
but he cannot make headway 
on the queenside: if Black's 
king moves to the kingside,

I 
Fortresses on the Chessboard 1 13 
White's king, his guard, will 
also move there. Nevertheless, 
there is no trace of a fortress 
here, you need only make 
three moves:

So we have become 
acquainted with some 
methods of defence in the 
endgame. There is one more 
method of defence consisting 
of building up micro-fort- 
resses of between two and five 
pieces. Put Black's king on a8, 
White's 
king on b6, and 
White's pawn on the 'a-file'. 
You will easily see that Black's 
king is comfortably posted on

fact is that even with White's 
Another, no less spectacular 
bastion can be built if the 
opponents, in addition to the 
kings, have queen and pawn vs 
rook and pawn. It is common 
knowledge that the queen is 
much stronger than the rook, 
but there are some positions 
where this axiom does not 
hold true. Here is one classical 
fortress with the king in the 
corner of the chessboard.

the possibilities and methods 
of building up tiny fortresses. 
But it is much better not to 
make serious errors and not to 
get bad endings! 
.

Lesson 23: The Beauty of Chess 
This lesson will be devoted to 
chess composition, the most 
beautiful and mysterious 
aspect of the art of chess. The 
definition of chess composit- 
ion as an art is by no means an 
exaggeration since problems 
and studies inspired by 
imagination give hours of 
enjoyment to millions of chess 
fans. 
Chess composition is 
guided by its own laws. Chess 
players remember and value 
highly brilliant games and 
combinations, no matter how 
many slight and hardly 
noticable mistakes they 
contain, Chess composers, 
however, mercilessly throw 
away the compositions, 
whatever awards they have 
won, if these compositions 
contain a small error or a dual 
solution. 
Chess frequently has 
situations in which one or 
several pieces are out of play. 
In chess composition this is 
utterly impossible. The chess 
composer invariably assigns a 
certain job to every piece on 
the chessboard. 
I am fond of solving chess 
problems and, particularly, 
chess studies. The time I take 
to solve compositions tests my 
sporting form and sometimes I 
use many similar ideas in 
practical play. 
I 
Chess problems are full of 
paradoxes and original ideas. 
Let us consider, for example, 
one of the problems composed 
by Samuel Loyd, the famous 
19th century American chess 
composer. 
While to play and male in three 
moves

The Beauty of Chess 11 7 
There is incredible pand- 
emonium on the chessboard. 
Black's f-pawn is also poised 
to queen.

2 
&e3!! 
Amazing! Black can now 
give ten checks, but each check 
is repulsed by mate. If you are 
capable of solving such a 
problem, you can find original 
non-standard continuations.

J 
Undoubtedly problem-solving 
stimulates the development of 
non-standard thinking. But 
studies are also helpful fot the 
chess player, enabling him to 
improve his game in another 
way. In a composition the 
author's idea is usually 
expressed most economically. 
Solving miniatures helps the 
chess player to use the 
maximum capacity of each 
piece in practical games. 
Let us see a study composed 
by Abram Guwich, a well- 
known Sovier chess composer. 
White to play and win 
How can White win? His 
pawn on c7 is doomed, His

In spite of material equality, 
Black is in zugzwang, and loss 
is immediate. After solving 
such studies, one can fully 
understand all the subtleties of 
doniination on the chess- 
board. 
In chess books we often 
come across the words 'the 
geomentry of the chessboard'. 
What is the essence of this 
'geometry'? In my opinion, 
to answer this question one 
should examine the brilliant 
study composed by the 
famous Czech Grandmaster 
Richard Reti. 
see following diagram 
The task seems absolutely 
White to play and draw 
impossible. Black's pawn is far 
advanced, and White's king 
can see the c6-pawn only 
through powerful binoculars. 
Therefore, the first moves 
appear to prove that White's 
resistance is to no avail.

The best example of 
geometry of the chessboard: 
the diagonal movement of the 
king was the shortest way to 
the goal. 
This study 
excites the 
imagination of chess fans even 
today, giving inspiration to 
budding composers. In 1929 
Alexander and Kirill Sarychev 
from Baku published an 
unforgettable miniature which 
added a bishop to the material 
in Reti's original study.

problems and studies, you will

beauty created by man's 
fantasy.

Lesson 24: Don't b g r d g e  the Time 
We now come to the last 
lesson. This course of lessons, 
first published in Sport in the 
USSR is the first which I have 
ever produced but I hope that 
I have succeeded to some 
extent in coping with the task. 
True enough, on re-reading 
the published material I've 
come to the conclusion that in 
some lessons certain ideas 
should have been expanded in 
greater detail whereas in 
others more examples should 
have been added. 
Chess is a remarkable game. 
After being around for fifteen 
centuries the wooden pieces 
have not only kept their charm 
but have become even more 
engrossing. The continuous 
march of human culture and 
thought has influenced our 
game. 
For millions of amateurs 
chess is really only a pleasantly 
acceptable pastime. They have 
no great sporting ambitions 
but simply play in tourn- 
aments and sometimes analyse 
games or solve problems or 
studies. However there are a 
few people for whom chess is 
their life. For them the 64- 
square board is a battlefield 
and the game of chess itself a 
mysterious and alluring art 
form. Through their rivalry 
masterpieces are created 
which will long excite interest 
and characters are hardened 
or broken. 
So then why do we, Caissa's 
disciples, love chess; what 
does it do for us? I, like many 
others, see in chess a 
remarkably accurate model of 
human life with its daily 
struggles and ups and downs. 
At the chessboard we get the 
chance to control events. We 
can devise plans and then try 
consistently to bring them to 
their logical conclusions - 
but surely isn't that analogous 
with what we do every day? 
You can't be successful 
anywhere and in anything 
unless you foster in yourself 
persistence, industriousness

122 Don't Begrudge the Time 
and the ability to evaluate 
objectively your opportunit- 
ies. You must be able to set 
yourself realis tic goals and 
strive for them logically, 
energetically and resolutely. 
How do the real lovers of 
chess, Caissa's willing slaves, 
get noticed? Probably the 
same way as in other sports. I 
remember my grandfather 
taking me to the Chess Club at 
the 'Baku Palace of Pioneers'. 
There were lots of children 
there who wanted to learn to 
play well. But after only a 
short while half of them had 
stopped going to the lessons or 
playing in tournaments. The 
first defeats and naturally, to 
start with, there are more of 
these than victories, had 
weeded out the irresolute. 
There remained only those 
who had from childhood been 
good in competitions. Thanks 
to chess, this ability to deal 
with any situation was rein- 
forced, the will strengthened, 
and the character hardened. 
Before parting with the 
reader I should like to give 
some advice to those who wish 
to further improve their chess: 
First and foremost you 
must learn to analyse your 
own games, looking for 
mistakes by either party and 
seeking to find the correct 
continuations. As a rule 
middlegame positions don't 
recur exactly but similar 
positions arise very often and 
after such analysis one should 
know the correct course of 
action. You should also 
become accustomed to 
analysing other people's 
games, constantly asking the 
questions 'Why did he play 
that? and 'Why wouldn't it 
have been better to play ...?' 
As a result, the number of 
familiar positions will grow 
and this will help you to 
orientate yourself better and 
more confidently during the 
course of a game. One's 
mastery of chess is greatly 
helped by studying !eading 
players' annotations of their 
own games; this should be 
done more and more 
attentively and thoughtfully. 
This work will help you to 
understand how the real 
masters solve specific 
problems and which factors 
they consider paramount in 
particular positions. At first, 
many of the annotations will 
be incomprehensible to you.

Don't Begrudge the Time 123 
Then there will be a period 
when it all seems incontrovert- 
ible. But finally there will 
come a time when you will 
start to have questions for the 
annotator: 'But why do you 
consider this necessary and 
not ... ' That will mean that 
your playing strength has 
increased. I worked on the 
annotations of such colossi 
as Alekhine, Capablanca, 
Botvinnik and Keres. Even 
now I feel deep gratitude to 
them for their priceless 
lessons. 
Of course by carefully 
working through, say, about a 
hundred of Capablanca's 
games you won't start to play 
exactly like him; indeed you 
will 'only' learn to apply the 
great Cuban chessplayer's 
methods in certain positions. 
But that is already a great deal, 
well worth more than a dozen 
hours' work. 
There is a huge volume of 
information already collected 
in thousands of text books, 
game collections, books on 
top players and encyclopedias 
of both openings and 
endgames. It simply isn't 
possible to memorise all the 
information but you ought to 
know it all the same. However, 
there is a single saving clause 
- the positional method of 
play. You couldn't, 
for 
example, memorise all the 
variations of the Scheveningen 
system in the Sicilian Defence, 
and learn up all the games. But 
in the course of 30-40 hours' 
work with the best opening 
monographs on that system, 
you can learn the main lines. 
These variations and dozens 
of illustrative games should 
have been written down in 
your exercise book. And as a 
result you would understand 
how to play typical positions 
in this system. A master's 
opening repertoire consists 
not of one but of dozens of 
systems. Their study and 
understanding of the right way 
of playing them requires a 
great deal of time. But for a 
master, and also for anybody 
who wants to become one that 
is indispensible. 
In conclusion if you want to 
unravel the multitude of 
secrets of chess then don't 
begrudge the time. I wish you 
success!

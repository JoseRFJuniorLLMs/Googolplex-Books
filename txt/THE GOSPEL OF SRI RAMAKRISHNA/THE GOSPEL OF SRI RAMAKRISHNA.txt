THE GOSPEL OF SRI RAMAKRISHNA

THE GOSPEL OF SRI RAMAKRISHNA 



















"SRI SRI RAMAKRISHNA KATHAMRITA" 





































By Mahendranath Gupta ("M"), His Disciple 










Translated from the Bengali by Swami Nikhilananda 



















FOREWORD 



















by Aldous Huxley 



















IN THE HISTORY of the arts, genius is a thing of very rare occurrence. Rarer still, however, 










are the competent reporters and recorders of that genius. The world has had many hundreds of 










admirable poets and philosophers; but of these hundreds only a very few have had the fortune to 










attract a Boswell or an Eckermann. 



















When we leave the field of art for that of spiritual religion, the scarcity of competent 










reporters becomes even more strongly marked. Of the day-to-day life of the great theocentric 










saints and contemplatives we know, in the great majority of cases, nothing whatever. Many, it is 










true, have recorded their doctrines in writing, and a few, such as St. Augustine, Suso and St. 










Teresa, have left us autobiographies of the greatest value. But, all doctrinal writing is in some 










measure formal and impersonal, while the autobiographer tends to omit what he regards as 










trifling matters and suffers from the further disadvantage of being unable to say how he strikes 










other people and in what way he affects their lives. Moreover, most saints have left neither 










writings nor self-portraits, and for knowledge of their lives, their characters and their teachings, 










we are forced to rely upon the records made by their disciples who, in most cases, have proved 










themselves singularly incompetent as reporters and biographers. Hence the special interest 










attaching to this enormously detailed account of the daily life and conversations of Sri 










Ramakrishna. 



















"M", as the author modestly styles himself, was peculiarly qualified for his task. To a 










reverent love for his master, to a deep and experiential knowledge of that master's teaching, he 










added a prodigious memory for the small happenings of each day and a happy gift for recording 










them in an interesting and realistic way. Making good use of his natural gifts and of the 










circumstances in which he found himself, "M" produced a book unique, so far as my knowledge 










goes, in the literature of hagiography. No other saint has had so able and indefatigable a Boswell. 










Never have the small events of a contemplative's daily life been described with such a wealth of 










intimate detail. Never have the casual and unstudied utterances of a great religious teacher been 










set down with so minute a fidelity. To Western readers, it is true, this fidelity and this wealth of 










detail are sometimes a trifle disconcerting; for the social, religious and intellectual frames of 










reference within which Sri Ramakrishna did his thinking and expressed his feelings were entirely 










Indian. But after the first few surprises and bewilderments, we begin to find something peculiarly 










stimulating and instructive about the very strangeness and, to our eyes, the eccentricity of the 










man revealed to us in "M's" narrative. What a scholastic philosopher would call the "accidents" of 










Ramakrishna's life were intensely Hindu and therefore, so far as we in the West are concerned, 





































unfamiliar and hard to understand; its "essence", however, was intensely mystical and therefore 










universal. To read through these conversations in which mystical doctrine alternates with an 










unfamiliar kind of humour, and where discussions of the oddest aspects of Hindu mythology give 










place to the most profound and subtle utterances about the nature of Ultimate Reality, is in itself a 










liberal, education in humility, tolerance and suspense of judgment. We must be grateful to the 










translator for his excellent version of a book so curious and delightful as a biographical document, 










so precious, at the same time, for what it teaches us of the life of the spirit. 



















PREFACE 



















by Swami Nikhilananda 



















The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is the English translation of the Sri Sri Ramakrishna 










Kathamrita, the conversations of Sri Ramakrishna with his disciples, devotees, and visitors, 










recorded by Mahendranath Gupta, who wrote the book under the pseudonym of "M." The 










conversations in Bengali fill five volumes, the first of which was published in 1897 and the last 










shortly after M.'s death in 1932. Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, has published in two volumes an 










English translation of selected chapters from the monumental Bengali work. I have consulted these 










while preparing my translation. 



















M., one of the intimate disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, was present during all the 










conversations recorded in the main body of the book and noted them down in his diary. They 










therefore have the value of almost stenographic records. In Appendix A are given several 










conversations which took place in the absence of M., but of which he received a first-hand record 










from persons concerned. The conversations will bring before the reader's mind an intimate picture 










of the Master's eventful life from March 1882 to April 24, 1886, only a few months before his 










passing away. During this period he came in contact chiefly with English-educated Bengalis; from 










among them he selected his disciples and the bearers of his message, and with them he shared his 










rich spiritual experiences. 



















I have made a literal translation, omitting only a few pages of no particular interest to 










English-speaking readers. Often literary grace has been sacrificed for the sake of literal translation. 










No translation can do full justice to the original. This difficulty is all the more felt in the present 










work, whose contents are of a deep mystical nature and describe the inner experiences of a great 










seer. Human language is an altogether inadequate vehicle to express supersensuous perception. 










Sri Ramakrishna was almost illiterate. He never clothed his thoughts in formal language. His 










words sought to convey his direct realization of Truth. His conversation was in a village patois. 










Therein lies its charm. In order to explain to his listeners an abstruse philosophy, he, like Christ 










before him, used with telling effect homely parables and illustrations, culled from his observation 










of the daily life around him. 



















The reader will find mentioned in this work many visions and experiences that fall outside 










the ken of physical science and even psychology. With the development of modern knowledge the 










border line between the natural and the supernatural is ever shifting its position. Genuine mystical 










experiences are not as suspect now as they were half a century ago. The words of Sri Ramakrishna 





































have already exerted a tremendous influence in the land of his birth. Savants of Europe have found 










in his words the ring of universal truth. 



















But these words were not the product of intellectual cogitation; they were rooted in direct 










experience. Hence, to students of religion, psychology, and physical science, these experiences of 










the Master are of immense value for the understanding of religious phenomena in general. No 










doubt Sri Ramakrishna was a Hindu of the Hindus; yet his experiences transcended the limits of 










the dogmas and creeds of Hinduism. Mystics of religions other than Hinduism will find in Sri 










Ramakrishna's experiences a corroboration of the experiences of their own prophets and seers. 










And this is very important today for the resuscitation of religious values. The sceptical reader may 










pass by the supernatural experiences; he will yet find in the book enough material to provoke his 










serious thought and solve many of his spiritual problems. 



















There are repetitions of teachings and parables in the book. I have kept them purposely. 










They have their charm and usefulness, repeated as they were in different settings. Repetition is 










unavoidable in a work of this kind. In the first place, different seekers come to a religious teacher 










with questions of more or less identical nature; hence the answers will be of more or less identical 










pattern. Besides, religious teachers of all times and climes have tried, by means of repetition, to 










hammer truths into the stony soil of the recalcitrant human mind. Finally, repetition does not 










seem tedious if the ideas repeated are dear to a man's heart. 



















I have thought it necessary to write a rather lengthy Introduction to the book. In it I have 










given the biography of the Master, descriptions of people who came in contact with him, short 










explanations of several systems of Indian religious thought intimately connected with Sri 










Ramakrishna's life, and other relevant matters which, I hope, will enable the reader better to 










understand and appreciate the unusual contents of this book. It is particularly important that the 










Western reader, unacquainted with Hindu religious thought, should first read carefully the 










introductory chapter, in order that he may fully enjoy these conversations. Many Indian terms and 










names have been retained in the book for want of suitable English equivalents. Their meaning is 










given either in the Glossary or in the foot-notes. The Glossary also gives explanations of a number 










of expressions unfamiliar to Western readers. The diacritical marks are explained under Notes on 










Pronunciation. 



















In the Introduction I have drawn much material from the Life of Sri Ramakrishna, published 










by the Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, India. I have also consulted the excellent article on Sri 










Ramakrishna by Swami Nirvedananda, in the second volume of the Cultural Heritage of India. 



















The book contains many songs sung either by the Master or by the devotees. These form an 










important feature of the spiritual tradition of Bengal and were for the most part written by men of 










mystical experience. For giving the songs their present form I am grateful to Mr. John Moffitt, Jr. 



















In the preparation of this manuscript I have received ungrudging help from several friends. 










Miss Margaret Woodrow Wilson and Mr. Joseph Campbell have worked hard in editing my 










translation. Mrs. Elizabeth Davidson has typed, more than once, the entire manuscript and 










rendered other valuable help. Mr. Aldous Huxley has laid me under a debt of gratitude by writing 










the Foreword. I sincerely thank them all. 





































In the spiritual firmament Sri Ramakrishna is a waxing crescent. Within one hundred years 










of his birth and fifty years of his death his message has spread across land and sea. Romain Rolland 










has described him as the fulfilment of the spiritual aspirations of the three hundred millions of 










Hindus for the last two thousand years. Mahatma Gandhi has written: "His life enables us to see 










God face to face. . . . Ramakrishna was a living embodiment of godliness." He is being 










recognized as a compeer of Krishna, Buddha, and Christ. 



















The life and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna have redirected the thoughts of the 










denationalized Hindus to the spiritual ideals of their forefathers. During the latter part of the 










nineteenth century his was the time-honoured role of the Saviour of the Eternal Religion of the 










Hindus. His teachings played an important part in liberalizing the minds of orthodox pundits and 










hermits. Even now he is the silent force that is moulding the spiritual destiny of India. His great 










disciple, Swami Vivekananda, was the first Hindu missionary to preach the message of Indian 










culture to the enlightened minds of Europe and America. The full consequence of Swami 










Vivekananda work is still in the womb of the future. 



















May this translation of the first book of its kind in the religious history of the world, being 










the record of the direct words of a prophet, help stricken humanity to come nearer to the Eternal 










Verity of life and remove dissension and quarrel from among the different faiths! May it enable 










seekers of Truth to grasp the subtle laws of the supersensuous realm, and unfold before man's 










restricted vision the spiritual foundation of the universe, the unity of existence, and the divinity of 










the soul!

THE RECORDER OF THE GOSPEL - MAHENDRANATH GUPTA 



















In the life of the great Saviours and Prophets of the world it is often found that they are 










accompanied by souls of high spiritual potency who play a conspicuous part in the furtherance of 










their Master's mission. They become so integral a part of the life and work of these great ones that 










posterity can think of them only in mutual association. Such is the case with Sri Ramakrishna and 










M., whose diary has come to be known to the world as the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in English 










and as Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita in the original Bengali version. 



















Sri Mahendra Nath Gupta, familiary known to the readers of the Gospel by his pen name 










M., and to the devotees as Master Mahashay, was born on the 14th of July, 1854 as the son of 










Madhusudan Gupta, an officer of the Calcutta High Court, and his wife, Swarnamayi Devi. He had a 










brilliant scholastic career at Hare School and the Presidency College at Calcutta. The range of his 










studies included the best that both occidental and oriental learning had to offer. English literature, 










history, economics, western philosophy and law on the one hand, and Sanskrit literature and 










grammar, Darsanas, Puranas, Smritis, Jainism, Buddhism, astrology and Ayurveda on the other 










were the subjects in which he attained considerable proficiency. 



















He was an educationist all his life both in a spiritual and in a secular sense. After he passed 










out of College, he took up work as headmaster in a number of schools in succession Narail High 





































School, City School, Ripon College School, Metropolitan School, Aryan School, Oriental School, 










Oriental Seminary and Model School. The causes of his migration from school to school were that 










he could not get on with some of the managements on grounds of principles and that often his 










spiritual mood drew him away to places of pilgrimage for long periods. He worked with some of 










the most noted public men of the time like Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Surendranath Banerjee. 










The latter appointed him as a professor in the City and Ripon Colleges where he taught subjects 










like English, philosophy, history and economics. In his later days he took over the Morton School, 










and he spent his time in the staircase room of the third floor of it, administering the school and 










preaching the message of the Master. He was much respected in educational circles where he was 










usually referred to as Rector Mahashay. A teacher who had worked under him writes thus in warm 










appreciation of his teaching methods: "Only when I worked with him in school could I appreciate 










what a great educationist he was. He would come down to the level of his students when teaching, 










though he himself was so learned, so talented. Ordinarily teachers confine their instruction to 










what is given in books without much thought as to whether the student can accept it or not. But 










M., would first of all gauge how much the student could take in and by what means. He would 










employ aids to teaching like maps, pictures and diagrams, so that his students could learn by 










seeing. Thirty years ago (from 1953) when the question of imparting education through the 










medium of the mother tongue was being discussed, M. had already employed Bengali as the 










medium of instruction in the Morton School." (M The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami 










Nityatmananda Part I. P. 15.) 



















Imparting secular education was, however, only his profession ; his main concern was with 










the spiritual regeneration of man a calling for which Destiny seems to have chosen him. From his 










childhood he was deeply pious, and he used to be moved very much by Sadhus, temples and Durga 










Puja celebrations. The piety and eloquence of the great Brahmo leader of the times, Keshab 










Chander Sen, elicited a powerful response from the impressionable mind of Mahendra Nath, as it 










did in the case of many an idealistic young man of Calcutta, and prepared him to receive the great 










Light that was to dawn on him with the coming of Sri Ramakrishna into his life. 



















This epoch-making event of his life came about in a very strange way. M. belonged to a joint 










family with several collateral members. Some ten years after he began his career as an 










educationist, bitter quarrels broke out among the members of the family, driving the sensitive M. 










to despair and utter despondency. He lost all interest in life and left home one night to go into the 










wide world with the idea of ending his life. At dead of night he took rest in his sister's house at 










Baranagar, and in the morning, accompanied by a nephew Siddheswar, he wandered from one 










garden to another in Calcutta until Siddheswar brought him to the Temple Garden of 










Dakshineswar where Sri Ramakrishna was then living. After spending some time in the beautiful 










rose gardens there, he was directed to the room of the Paramahamsa, where the eventful meeting 










of the Master and the disciple took place on a blessed evening (the exact date is not on record) on 










a Sunday in March 1882. As regards what took place on the occasion, the reader is referred to the 










opening section of the first chapter of the Gospel. 



















The Master, who divined the mood of desperation in M, his resolve to take leave of this 










'play-field of deception', put new faith and hope into him by his gracious words of assurance: "God 










forbid! Why should you take leave of this world? Do you not feel blessed by discovering your 





































Guru? By His grace, what is beyond all imagination or dreams can be easily achieved!" At these 










words the clouds of despair moved away from the horizon of M.'s mind, and the sunshine of a new 










hope revealed to him fresh vistas of meaning in life. Referring to this phase of his life, M. used to 










say, "Behold! where is the resolve to end life, and where, the discovery of God! That is, sorrow 










should be looked upon as a friend of man. God is all good." (Ibid P. 33.) 



















After this resettlement, M's life revolved around the Master, though he continued his 










professional work as an educationist. During all holidays, including Sundays, he spent his time at 










Dakshineswar in the Master's company, and at times extended his stay to several days. 



















It did not take much time for M. to become very intimate with the Master, or for the Master 










to recognise in this disciple a divinely commissioned partner in the fulfilment of his spiritual 










mission. When M. was reading out the Chaitanya Bhagavata, the Master discovered that he had 










been, in a previous birth, a disciple and companion of the great Vaishnava Teacher, Sri Chaitanya 










Mahaprabhu, and the Master even saw him 'with his naked eye' participating in the ecstatic 










mass-singing of the Lord's name under the leadership of that Divine personality. So the Master 










told M, "You are my own, of the same substance as the father and the son," indicating thereby 










that M was one of the chosen few and a part and parcel of his Divine mission. 



















There was an urge in M. to abandon the household life and become a Sannyasin. When he 










communicated this idea to the Master, he forbade him saying," Mother has told me that you have 










to do a little of Her work you will have to teach Bhagavata, the word of God to humanity. The 










Mother keeps a Bhagavata Pandit with a bondage in the world!" (Ibid P. 36.) 



















An appropriate allusion indeed! Bhagavata, the great scripture that has given the word of 










Sri Krishna to mankind, was composed by the Sage Vyasa under similar circumstances. When 










caught up in a mood of depression like that of M, Vyasa was advised by the sage Narada that he 










would gain peace of mind only qn composing a work exclusively devoted to the depiction of the 










Lord's glorious attributes and His teachings on Knowledge and Devotion, and the result was that 










the world got from Vyasa the invaluable gift of the Bhagavata Purana depicting the life and 










teachings of Sri Krishna. From the mental depression of the modem Vyasa, the world has obtained 










the Kathamrita (Bengali Edition) the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in English. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was a teacher for both the Orders of mankind, Sannyasins and 










householders. His own life offered an ideal example for both, and he left behind disciples who 










followed the highest traditions he had set in respect of both these ways of life. M., along with Nag 










Mahashay, exemplified how a householder can rise to the highest level of sagehood. M. was 










married to Nikunja Devi, a distant relative of Keshab Chander Sen, even when he was reading at 










College, and he had four children, two sons and two daughters. The responsibility of the family, no 










doubt, made him dependent on his professional income, but the great devotee that he was, he 










never compromised with ideals and principles for this reason. Once when he was working as the 










headmaster in a school managed by the great Vidyasagar, the results of the school at the public 










examination happened to be rather poor, and Vidyasagar attributed it to M's preoccupation with 










the Master and his consequent failure to attend adequately to the school work. M. at once 










resigned his post without any thought of the morrow. Within a fortnight the family was in poverty, 





































and M. was one day pacing up and down the verandah of his house, musing how he would feed his 










children the next day. Just then a man came with a letter addressed to 'Mahendra Babu', and on 










opening it, M. found that it was a letter from his friend Sri Surendra Nath Banerjee, asking whether 










he would like to take up a professorship in the Ripon College. In this way three or four times he 










gave up the job that gave him the wherewithal to support the family, either for upholding 










principles or for practising spiritual Sadhanas in holy places, without any consideration of the 










possible dire worldly consequences; but he was always able to get over these difficulties 










somehow, and the interests of his family never suffered. In spite of his disregard for worldly goods, 










he was, towards the latter part of his life, in a fairly flourishing condition as the proprietor of the 










Morton School which he developed into a noted educational institution in the city. The Lord has 










said in the Bhagavad Gita that in the case of those who think of nothing except Him, He Himself 










would take up all their material and spiritual responsibilities. M. was an example of the truth of the 










Lord's promise. 



















Though his children received proper attention from him, his real family, both during the 










Master's life-time and after, consisted of saints, devotees, Sannyasins and spiritual aspirants. His 










life exemplifies the Master's teaching that an ideal householder must be like a good maid-servant 










of a family, loving and caring properly for the children of the house, but knowing always that her 










real home and children are elsewhere. During the Master's life-time he spent all his Sundays and 










other holidays with him and his devotees, and besides listening to the holy talks and devotional 










music, practised meditation both on the Personal and the Impersonal aspects of God under the 










direct guidance of the Master. In the pages of the Gospel the reader gets a picture of M.'s spiritual 










relationship with the Master how from a hazy belief in the Impersonal God of the Brahmos, he was 










step by step brought to accept both Personality and Impersonality as the two aspects of the same 










Non-dual Being, how he was convinced of the manifestation of that Being as Gods, Goddesses and 










as Incarnations, and how he was established in a life that was both of a Jnani and of a Bhakta. This 










Jnani-Bhakta outlook and way of living became so dominant a feature of his life that Swami 










Raghavananda, who was very closely associated with him during his last six years, remarks: 










"Among those who lived with M. in latter days, some felt that he always lived in this constant and 










conscious union with God even with open eyes (i.e., even in waking consciousness)." (Swami 










Raghavananda's article on M. in Prabuddha Bharata vol. XXXVII. P. 442.) 



















Besides undergoing spiritual disciplines at the feet of the Master, M. used to go to holy 










places during the Master's life-time itself and afterwards too as a part of his Sadhana. He was one 










of the earliest of the disciples to visit Kamarpukur, the birthplace of the Master, in the latter's 










life-time itself; for he wished to practise contemplation on the Master's early life in its true original 










setting. His experience there is described as follows by Swami Nityatmananda: "By the grace of the 










Master, he saw the entire Kamarpukur as a holy place bathed in an effulgent Light. Trees and 










creepers, beasts and birds and men all were made of effulgence. So he prostrated to all on the 










road. He saw a torn cat, which appeared to him luminous with the Light of Consciousness. 










Immediately he fell to the ground and saluted it" (M The Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami 










Nityatmananda vol. I. P. 40.) He had similar experience in Dakshineswar also. At the instance of the 










Master he also visited Puri, and in the words of Swami Nityatmananda, "with indomitable courage, 










M. embraced the image of Jagannath out of season." 





































The life of Sadhana and holy association that he started on at the feet of the Master, he 










continued all through his life. He has for this reason been most appropriately described as a 










Grihastha-Sannyasi (householder-Sannyasin). Though he was forbidden by the Master to become a 










Sannyasin, his reverence for the Sannyasa ideal was whole-hearted and was without any 










reservation. So after Sri Ramakrishna's passing away, while several of the Master's householder 










devotees considered the young Sannyasin disciples of the Master as inexperienced and 










inconsequential, M. stood by them with the firm faith that the Master's life and message were 










going to be perpetuated only through them. Swami Vivekananda wrote from America in a letter to 










the inmates of the Math: "When Sri Thakur (Master) left the body, every one gave us up as a few 










unripe urchins. But M. and a few others did not leave us in the lurch. We cannot repay our debt to 










them." (Swami Raghavananda's article on M. in Prabuddha Bharata vol. XXX P. 442.) 



















M. spent his weekends and holidays with the monastic brethren who, after the Master's 










demise, had formed themselves into an Order with a Math at Baranagore, and participated in the 










intense life of devotion and meditation that they followed. At other times he would retire to 










Dakshineswar or some garden in the city and spend several days in spiritual practice taking simple 










self-cooked food. In order to feel that he was one with all mankind he often used to go out of his 










home at dead of night, and like a wandering Sannyasin, sleep with the waifs on some open 










verandah or footpath on the road. 



















After the Master's demise, M. went on pilgrimage several times. He visited Banaras, 










Vrindavan, Ayodhya and other places. At Banaras he visited the famous Trailinga Swami and fed 










him with sweets, and he had long conversations with Swami Bhaskarananda, one of the noted 










saintly and scholarly Sannyasins of the time. In 1912 he went with the Holy Mother to Banaras, 










and spent about a year in the company of Sannyasins at Banaras, Vrindavan, Hardwar, Hrishikesh 










and Swargashram. But he returned to Calcutta, as that city offered him the unique opportunity of 










associating himself with the places hallowed by the Master in his life-time. Afterwards he does not 










seem to have gone to any far-off place, but stayed on in his room in the Morton School carrying on 










his spiritual ministry, speaking on the Master and his teachings to the large number of people who 










flocked to him after having read his famous Kathamrita known to English readers as The Gospel of 










Sri Ramakrishna. 



















This brings us to the circumstances that led to the writing and publication of this 










monumental work, which has made M. one of the immortals in hagiographic literature. While 










many educated people heard Sri Ramakrishna's talks, it was given to this illustrious personage 










alone to leave a graphic and exact account of them for posterity, with details like date, hour, place, 










names and particulars about participants. Humanity owes this great book to the ingrained habit of 










diary-keeping with which M. was endowed. Even as a boy of about thirteen, while he was a 










student in the 3rd class of the Hare School, he was in the habit of keeping a diary. "Today on 










rising," he wrote in his diary, "I greeted my father and mother, prostrating on the ground before 










them" (Swami Nityatmananda's 'M The Apostle and the Evangelist' Part I. P 29.) At another place 










he wrote, "Today, while on my way to school, I visited, as usual, the temples of Kali, the Mother at 










Tharitharia, and of Mother Sitala, and paid my obeisance to them." About twenty-five years after, 










when he met the Great Master in the spring of 1882, it was the same instinct of a born diary-writer 










that made him begin his book, 'unique in the literature of hagiography', with the memorable 





































words: "When hearing the name of Hari or Rama once, you shed tears and your hair stands on 










end, then you may know for certain that you do not have to perform devotions such as Sandhya 










any more." 



















In addition to this instinct for diary-keeping, M. had great endowments contributing to 










success in this line. Writes Swami Nityatmananda who lived in close association with M., in his 










book entitled M - The Apostle and Evangelist: "M.'s prodigious memory combined with his 










extraordinary power of imagination completely annihilated the distance of time and place for him. 










Even after the lapse of half a century he could always visualise vividly, scenes from the life of Sri 










Ramakrishna. Superb too was his power to portray pictures by words." 



















Besides the prompting of his inherent instinct, the main inducement for M. to keep this 










diary of his experiences at Dakshineswar was his desire to provide himself with a means for living 










in holy company at all times. Being a school teacher, he could be with the Master only on Sundays 










and other holidays, and it was on his diary that he depended for 'holy company' on other days. The 










devotional scriptures like the Bhagavata say that holy company is the first and most important 










means for the generation and growth of devotion. For, in such company man could hear talks on 










spiritual matters and listen to the glorification of Divine attributes, charged with the fervour and 










conviction emanating from the hearts of great lovers of God. Such company is therefore the one 










certain means through which Sraddha (Faith), Rati (attachment to God) and Bhakti (loving 










devotion) are generated. The diary of his visits to Dakshineswar provided M. with material for re- 










living, through reading and contemplation, the holy company he had had earlier, even on days 










when he was not able to visit Dakshineswar. The wealth of details and the vivid description of men 










and things in the midst of which the sublime conversations are set, provide excellent material to 










re-live those experiences for any one with imaginative powers. It was observed by M.'s disciples 










and admirers that in later life also whenever he was free or alone, he would be pouring over his 










diary, transporting himself on the wings of imagination to the glorious days he spent at the feet of 










the Master. 



















During the Master's life-time M. does not seem to have revealed the contents of his diary to 










any one. There is an unconfirmed tradition that when the Master saw him taking notes, he 










expressed apprehension at the possibility of his utilising these to publicise him like Keshab Sen; for 










the Great Master was so full of the spirit of renunciation and humility that he disliked being 










lionised. It must be for this reason that no one knew about this precious diary of M. for a decade 










until he brought out selections from it as a pamphlet in English in 1897 with the Holy Mother's 










blessings and permission. The Holy Mother, being very much pleased to hear parts of the diary 










read to her in Bengali, wrote to M.: "When I heard the Kathamrita, (Bengali name of the book) I 










felt as if it was he, the Master, who was saying all that." (Ibid Part I. P 37.) 



















The two pamphlets in English entitled the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna appeared in October 










and November 1897. They drew the spontaneous acclamation of Swami Vivekananda, who wrote 










on 24th November of that year from Dehra Dun to M. : "Many many thanks for your second 










leaflet. It is indeed wonderful. The move is quite original, and never was the life of a Great Teacher 










brought before the public untarnished by the writer's mind, as you are doing. The language also is 










beyond all praise, so fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy. I cannot express in adequate 





































terms how I have enjoyed them. I am really in a transport when I read them. Strange, isn't it? Our 










Teacher and Lord was so original, and each one of us will have to be original or nothing. I now 










understand why none of us attempted His life before. It has been reserved for you, this great 










work. He is with you evidently." (Vedanta Kesari Vol. XIX P. 141. Also given in the first edition of 










the Gospel published from Ramakrishna Math, Madras in 1911.) 



















And Swamiji added a post script to the letter: "Socratic dialogues are Plato all over you are 










entirely hidden. Moreover, the dramatic part is infinitely beautiful. Everybody likes it here or in the 










West." Indeed, in order to be unknown, Mahendranath had used the pen-name M., under which 










the book has been appearing till now. But so great a book cannot remain obscure for long, nor can 










its author remain unrecognised by the large public in these modern times. M. and his book came 










to be widely known very soon and to meet the growing demand, a full-sized book, Vol. I of the 










Gospel, translated by the author himself, was published in 1907 by the Brahmavadin Office, 










Madras. A second edition of it, revised by the author, was brought out by the Ramakrishna Math, 










Madras in December 1911, and subsequently a second part, containing new chapters from the 










original Bengali, was published by the same Math in 1922. The full English translation of the Gospel 










by Swami Nikhilananda appeared first in 1942. 



















In Bengali the book is published in five volumes, the first part having appeared in 1902 and 










the others in 1905, 1907, 1910 and 1932 respectively. 



















It looks as if M. was brought to the world by the Great Master to record his words and 










transmit them to posterity. Swami Sivananda, a direct disciple of the Master and the second 










President of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, says on this topic: "Whenever there was an 










interesting talk, the Master would call Master Mahashay if he was not in the room, and then draw 










his attention to the holy words spoken. We did not know then why the Master did so. Now we can 










realise that this action of the Master had an important significance, for it was reserved for Master 










Mahashay to give to the world at large the sayings of the Master." (Vedanta Kesari Vol. XIX P 141.) 










Thanks to M., we get, unlike in the case of the great teachers of the past, a faithful record with 










date, time, exact report of conversations, description of concerned men and places, references to 










contemporary events and personalities and a hundred other details for the last four years of the 










Master's life (1882-'86), so that no one can doubt the historicity of the Master and his teachings at 










any time in the future. 



















M. was, in every respect, a true missionary of Sri Ramakrishna right from his first 










acquaintance with him in 1882. As a school teacher, it was a practice with him to direct to the 










Master such of his students as had a true spiritual disposition. Though himself prohibited by the 










Master to take to monastic life, he encouraged all spiritually inclined young men he came across in 










his later life to join the monastic Order. Swami Vijnanananda, a direct Sannyasin disciple of the 










Master and a President of the Ramakrishna Order, once remarked to M.: "By enquiry, I have come 










to the conclusion that eighty percent and more of the Sannyasins have embraced the monastic life 










after reading the Kathamrita (Bengali name of the book) and coming in contact with you." (M The 










Apostle and the Evangelist by Swami Nityatmananda Part I, P 37.) 





































In 1905 he retired from the active life of a Professor and devoted his remaining 










twenty-seven years exclusively to the preaching of the life and message of the Great Master. He 










bought the Morton Institution from its original proprietors and shifted it to a commodious 










four-storeyed house at 50 Amherst Street, where it flourished under his management as one of 










the most efficient educational institutions in Calcutta. He generally occupied a staircase room at 










the top of it, cooking his own meal which consisted only of milk and rice without variation, and 










attended to all his personal needs himself. His dress also was the simplest possible. It was his 










conviction that limitation of personal wants to the minimum is an important aid to holy living. 










About one hour in the morning he would spend in inspecting the classes of the school, and then 










retire to his staircase room to pour over his diary and live in the divine atmosphere of the earthly 










days of the Great Master, unless devotees and admirers had already gathered in his room seeking 










his holy company. 



















In appearance, M. looked a Vedic Rishi. Tall and stately in bearing, he had a strong and 










well-built body, an unusually broad chest, high forehead and arms extending to the knees. His 










complexion was fair and his prominent eyes were always tinged with the expression of the divine 










love that filled his heart. Adorned with a silvery beard that flowed luxuriantly down his chest, and 










a shining face radiating the serenity and gravity of holiness, M. was as imposing and majestic as he 










was handsome and engaging in appearance. Humorous, sweet-tongued and eloquent when 










situations required, this great Maharishi of our age lived only to sing the glory of Sri Ramakrishna 










day and night. Though a very well versed scholar in the Upanishads, Gita and the philosophies of 










the East and the West, all his discussions and teachings found their culmination in the life and the 










message of Sri Ramakrishna, in which he found the real explanation and illustration of all the 










scriptures. Both consciously and unconsciously, he was the teacher of the Kathamrita the 










nectarine words of the Great Master. 



















Though a much-sought-after spiritual guide, an educationist of repute, and a contemporary 










and close associate of illustrious personages like Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Keshab 










Chander Sen and Iswar Chander Vidyasagar, he was always moved by the noble humanity of a 










lover of God, which consists in respecting the personalities of all as receptacles of the Divine Spirit. 










So he taught without the consciousness of a teacher, and no bar of superiority stood in the way of 










his doing the humblest service to his students and devotees. "He was a commission of love," writes 










his close devotee, Swami Raghavananda, "and yet his soft and sweet words would pierce the 










stoniest heart, make the worldly-minded weep and repent and turn Godwards." (Prabuddha 










Bharata Vol. XXXVII P 499.) 



















As time went on and the number of devotees increased, the staircase room and terrace of 










the 3rd floor of the Morton Institution became a veritable Naimisaranya of modern times, 










resounding during all hours of the day, and sometimes of night, too, with the word of God coming 










from the Rishi-like face of M. addressed to the eager God-seekers sitting around. To the devotees 










who helped him in preparing the text of the Gospel, he would dictate the conversations of the 










Master in a meditative mood, referring now and then to his diary. At times in the stillness of 










midnight he would awaken a nearby devotee and tell him: "Let us listen to the words of the 










Master in the depths of the night as he explains the truth of the Pranava." (Vedanta Kesari XIX P. 










142.) Swami Raghavananda, an intimate devotee of M., writes as follows about these devotional 





































sittings: "In the sweet and warm months of April and May, sitting under the canopy of heaven on 










the roof-garden of 50 Amherst Street, surrounded by shrubs and plants, himself sitting in their 










midst like a Rishi of old, the stars and planets in their courses beckoning us to things infinite and 










sublime, he would speak to us of the mysteries of God and His love and of the yearning that would 










rise in the human heart to solve the Eternal Riddle, as exemplified in the life of his Master. The 










mind, melting under the influence of his soft sweet words of light, would almost transcend the 










frontiers of limited existence and dare to peep into the infinite. He himself would take the 










influence of the setting and say,'What a blessed privilege it is to sit in such a setting (pointing to 










the starry heavens), in the company of the devotees discoursing on God and His love!' These 










unforgettable scenes will long remain imprinted on the minds of his hearers." (Prabuddha Bharata 










Vol XXXVII P 497.) 



















About twenty-seven years of his life he spent in this way in the heart of the great city of 










Calcutta, radiating the Master's thoughts and ideals to countless devotees who flocked to him, and 










to still larger numbers who read his Kathamrita (English Edition : The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna), 










the last part of which he had completed before June 1932 and given to the press. And 










miraculously, as it were, his end also came immediately after he had completed his life's mission. 










About three months earlier he had come to stay at his home at 13/2 Gurdasprasad Chaudhuary 










Lane at Thakur Bari, where the Holy Mother had herself installed the Master and where His regular 










worship was being conducted for the previous 40 years. The night of 3rd June being the 










Phalaharini Kali Pooja day, M. had sent his devotees who used to keep company with him, to 










attend the special worship at Belur Math at night. After attending the service at the home shrine, 










he went through the proof of the Kathamrita for an hour. Suddenly he got a severe attack of 










neuralgic pain, from which he had been suffering now and then, of late. Before 6 a.m. in the 










early hours of 4th June 1932 he passed away, fully conscious and chanting: 'Gurudeva-Ma, Kole 










tule na-o (Take me in your arms! Master! Mother!!)' 



















SWAM I TAPASYANANDA 



















Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras March 1974. 



















INTRODUCTION 



















by Swami Nikhilananda 



















Sri Ramakrishna, the God-man of modern India, was born at Kamarpukur. This village in the 










Hooghly District preserved during the last century the idyllic simplicity of the rural areas of Bengal. 










Situated far from the railway, it was untouched by the glamour of the city. It contained rice-fields, 










tall palms, royal banyans, a few lakes, and two cremation grounds. South of the village a stream 










took its leisurely course. A mango orchard dedicated by a neighbouring zamindar to the public use 










was frequented by the boys for their noonday sports. A highway passed through the village to the 










great temple of Jagannath at Puri, and the villagers, most of whom were farmers and craftsmen, 










entertained many passing holy men and pilgrims. The dull round of the rural life was broken by 










lively festivals, the observance of sacred days, religious singing, and other innocent pleasures. 





































About his parents Sri Ramakrishna once said: "My mother was the personification of 










rectitude and gentleness. She did not know much about the ways of the world; innocent of the art 










of concealment, she would say what was in her mind. People loved her for open-heartedness. My 










father, an orthodox brahmin, never accepted gifts from the Sudras. He spent much of his time in 










worship and meditation, and in repeating God's name and chanting His glories. Whenever in his 










daily prayers he invoked the Goddess Gayatri, his chest flushed and tears rolled down his cheeks. 










He spent his leisure hours making garlands for the Family Deity, Raghuvir." 



















Khudiram Chattopadhyaya and Chandra Devi, the parents of Sri Ramakrishna, were married 










in 1799. At that time Khudiram was living in his ancestral village of Derepore, not far from 










Kamarpukur. Their first son, Ramkumar, was born in 1805, and their first daughter, Katyayani, in 










1810. In 1814 Khudiram was ordered by his landlord to bear false witness in court against a 










neighbour. When he refused to do so, the landlord brought a false case against him and deprived 










him of his ancestral property. Thus dispossessed, he arrived, at the invitation of another landlord, 










in the quiet village of Kamarpukur, where he was given a dwelling and about an acre of fertile land. 










The crops from this little property were enough to meet his family's simple needs. Here he lived in 










simplicity, dignity, and contentment. 



















Ten years after his coming to Kamarpukur, Khudiram made a pilgrimage on foot to 










Rameswar, at the southern extremity of India. Two years later was born his second son, whom he 










named Rameswar. Again in 1835, at the age of sixty, he made a pilgrimage, this time to Gaya. 










Here, from ancient times, Hindus have come from the four corners of India to discharge their 










duties to their departed ancestors by offering them food and drink at the sacred footprint of the 










Lord Vishnu. At this holy place Khudiram had a dream in which the Lord Vishnu promised to be 










born as his son. And Chandra Devi, too, in front of the Siva temple at Kamarpukur, had a vision 










indicating the birth of a divine child. Upon his return the husband found that she had conceived. 



















It was on February 18, 1836, that the child, to be known afterwards as Ramakrishna, was 










born. In memory of the dream at Gaya he was given the name of Gadadhar, the "Bearer of the 










Mace", an epithet of Vishnu. Three years later a little sister was born. 



















Boyhood 



















Gadadhar grew up into a healthy and restless boy, full of fun and sweet mischief. He was 










intelligent and precocious and endowed with a prodigious memory. On his father's lap he learnt by 










heart the names of his ancestors and the hymns to the gods and goddesses, and at the village 










school he was taught to read and write. But his greatest delight was to listen to recitations of 










stories from Hindu mythology and the epics. These he would afterwards recount from memory, to 










the great joy of the villagers. Painting he enjoyed; the art of moulding images of the gods and 










goddesses he learnt from the potters. But arithmetic was his great aversion. 



















At the age of six or seven Gadadhar had his first experience of spiritual ecstasy. One day in 










June or July, when he was walking along a narrow path between paddy-fields, eating the puffed 










rice that he carried in a basket, he looked up at the sky and saw a beautiful, dark thunder-cloud. As 










it spread, rapidly enveloping the whole sky, a flight of snow-white cranes passed in front of it. The 










beauty of the contrast overwhelmed the boy. He fell to the ground, unconscious, and the puffed 





































rice went in all directions. Some villagers found him and carried him home in their arms. Gadadhar 










said later that in that state he had experienced an indescribable joy. 



















Gadadhar was seven years old when his father died. This incident profoundly affected him. 










For the first time the boy realized that life on earth was impermanent. Unobserved by others, he 










began to slip into the mango orchard or into one of the cremation grounds, and he spent hours 










absorbed in his own thoughts. He also became more helpful to his mother in the discharge of her 










household duties. He gave more attention to reading and hearing the religious stories recorded in 










the Puranas. And he became interested in the wandering monks and pious pilgrims who would 










stop at Kamarpukur on their way to Puri. These holy men, the custodians of India's spiritual 










heritage and the living witnesses of the ideal of renunciation of the world and all-absorbing love of 










God, entertained the little boy with stories from the Hindu epics, stories of saints and prophets, 










and also stories of their own adventures. He, on his part, fetched their water and fuel and served 










them in various ways. Meanwhile, he was observing their meditation and worship. 



















At the age of nine, Gadadhar was invested with the Sacred Thread. This ceremony 










conferred upon him the privileges of his brahmin lineage, including the worship of the Family 










Deity, Raghuvir, and imposed upon him the many strict disciplines of a brahmin's life. During the 










ceremony of investiture he shocked his relatives by accepting a meal cooked by his nurse, a Sudra 










woman. His father would never have dreamt of doing such a thing. But in a playful mood Gadadhar 










had once promised this woman that he would eat her food, and now he fulfilled his plighted word. 










The woman had piety and religious sincerity, and these were more important to the boy than the 










conventions of society. 



















Gadadhar was now permitted to worship Raghuvir. Thus began his first training in 










meditation. He so gave his heart and soul to the worship that the stone image very soon appeared 










to him as the living Lord of the Universe. His tendency to lose himself in contemplation was first 










noticed at this time. Behind his boyish light-heartedness was seen a deepening of his spiritual 










nature. 



















About this time, on the Sivaratri night, consecrated to the worship of Siva, a dramatic 










performance was arranged. The principal actor, who was to play the part of Siva, suddenly fell ill, 










and Gadadhar was persuaded to act in his place. While friends were dressing him for the role of 










Siva - smearing his body with ashes, matting his locks, placing a trident in his hand and a string of 










rudrakasa beads around his neck - the boy appeared to become absent-minded. He approached 










the stage with slow and measured step, supported by his friends. He looked the living image of 










Siva. The audience loudly applauded what it took to be his skill as an actor, but it was soon 










discovered that he was really lost in meditation. His countenance was radiant and tears flowed 










from his eyes. He was lost to the outer world. The effect of this scene on the audience was 










tremendous. The people felt blessed as by a vision of Siva Himself. The performance had to be 










stopped, and the boy's mood lasted till the following morning. 



















Gadadhar himself now organized a dramatic company with his young friends. The stage was 










set in the mango orchard. The themes were selected from the stories of the Ramayana and the 










Mahabharata. Gadadhar knew by heart almost all the roles, having heard them from professional 





































actors. His favourite theme was the Vrindavan episode of Krishna's life, depicting those exquisite 










love-stories of Krishna and the milkmaids and the cowherd boys. Gadadhar would play the parts of 










Radha or Krishna and would often lose himself in the character he was portraying. His natural 










feminine grace heightened the dramatic effect. The mango orchard would ring with the loud kirtan 










of the boys. Lost in song and merry-making, Gadadhar became indifferent to the routine of school. 



















In 1849 Ramkumar, the eldest son, went to Calcutta to improve the financial condition of 










the family. Gadadhar was on the threshold of youth. He had become the pet of the women of the 










village. They loved to hear him talk, sing, or recite from the holy books. They enjoyed his knack of 










imitating voices. Their woman's instinct recognized the innate purity and guilelessness of this boy 










of clear skin, flowing hair, beaming eyes, smiling face, and inexhaustible fun. The pious elderly 










women looked upon him as Gopala, the Baby Krishna, and the younger ones saw in him the 










youthful Krishna of Vrindavan. He himself so idealised the love of the gopis for Krishna that he 










sometimes yearned to be born as a woman, if he must be born again, in order to be able to love Sri 










Krishna with all his heart and soul. 



















COMING TO CALCUTTA 



















At the age of sixteen Gadadhar was summoned to Calcutta by his elder brother Ramkumar, 










who wished assistance in his priestly duties. Ramkumar had opened a Sanskrit academy to 










supplement his income, and it was his intention gradually to turn his younger brother's mind to 










education. Gadadhar applied himself heart and soul to his new duty as family priest to a number of 










Calcutta families. His worship was very different from that of the professional priests. He spent 










hours decorating the images and singing hymns and devotional songs; he performed with love the 










other duties of his office. People were impressed with his ardour. But to his studies he paid scant 










attention. 



















Ramkumar did not at first oppose the ways of his temperamental brother. He wanted 










Gadadhar to become used to the conditions of city life. But one day he decided to warn the boy 










about his indifference to the world. After all, in the near future Gadadhar must, as a householder, 










earn his livelihood through the performance of his brahminical duties; and these required a 










thorough knowledge of Hindu law, astrology, and kindred subjects. He gently admonished 










Gadadhar and asked him to pay more attention to his studies. But the boy replied spiritedly: 










"Brother, what shall I do with a mere bread-winning education? I would rather acquire that 










wisdom which will illumine my heart and give me satisfaction for ever." 



















BREAD-WINNING EDUCATION 



















The anguish of the inner soul of India found expression through these passionate words of 










the young Gadadhar. For what did his unsophisticated eyes see around him in Calcutta, at that 










time the metropolis of India and the centre of modern culture and learning? Greed and lust held 










sway in the higher levels of society, and the occasional religious practices were merely outer forms 










from which the soul had long ago departed. Gadadhar had never seen anything like this at 










Kamarpukur among the simple and pious villagers. The sadhus and wandering monks whom he 










had served in his boyhood had revealed to him an altogether different India. He had been 










impressed by their devotion and purity, their self-control and renunciation. He had learnt from 





































them and from his own intuition that the ideal of life as taught by the ancient sages of India was 










the realization of God. 



















When Ramkumar reprimanded Gadadhar for neglecting a "bread-winning education", the 










inner voice of the boy reminded him that the legacy of his ancestors - the legacy of Rama, Krishna, 










Buddha, Sankara, Ramanuja, Chaitanya - was not worldly security but the Knowledge of God. And 










these noble sages were the true representatives of Hindu society. Each of them was seated, as it 










were, on the crest of the wave that followed each successive trough in the tumultuous course of 










Indian national life. All demonstrated that the life current of India is spirituality. This truth was 










revealed to Gadadhar through that inner vision which scans past and future in one sweep, 










unobstructed by the barriers of time and space. But he was unaware of the history of the profound 










change that had taken place in the land of his birth during the previous one hundred years. 



















Hindu society during the eighteenth century had been passing through a period of 










decadence. It was the twilight of the Mussalman rule. There were anarchy and confusion in all 










spheres. Superstitious practices dominated the religious life of the people. Rites and rituals passed 










for the essence of spirituality. Greedy priests became the custodians of heaven. True philosophy 










was supplanted by dogmatic opinions. The pundits took delight in vain polemics. 



















In 1757 English traders laid the foundation of British rule in India. Gradually the 










Government was systematized and lawlessness suppressed. The Hindus were much impressed by 










the military power and political acumen of the new rulers. In the wake of the merchants came the 










English educators, and social reformers, and Christian missionaries - all bearing a culture 










completely alien to the Hindu mind. In different parts of the country educational institutions were 










set up and Christian churches established. Hindu young men were offered the heady wine of the 










Western culture of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and they drank it to the 










very dregs. 



















The first effect of the draught on the educated Hindus was a complete effacement from 










their minds of the time-honoured beliefs and traditions of Hindu society. They came to believe 










that there was no transcendental Truth. The world perceived by the senses was all that existed. 










God and religion were illusions of the untutored mind. True knowledge could be derived only from 










the analysis of nature. So atheism and agnosticism became the fashion of the day. The youth of 










India, taught in English schools, took malicious delight in openly breaking the customs and 










traditions of their society. They would do away with the caste-system and remove the 










discriminatory laws about food. Social reform, the spread of secular education, widow remarriage, 










abolition of early marriage they considered these the panacea for the degenerate condition of 










Hindu society. 



















The Christian missionaries gave the finishing touch to the process of transformation. They 










ridiculed as relics of a barbarous age the images and rituals of the Hindu religion. They tried to 










persuade India that the teachings of her saints and seers were the cause of her downfall, that her 










Vedas, Puranas, and other scriptures were filled with superstition. Christianity, they maintained, 










had given the white races position and power in this world and assurance of happiness in the next; 










therefore Christianity was the best of all religions. Many intelligent young Hindus became 





































converted. The man in the street was confused. The majority of the educated grew materialistic in 










their mental outlook. Everyone living near Calcutta or the other strongholds of Western culture, 










even those who attempted to cling to the orthodox traditions of Hindu society, became infected 










by the new uncertainties and the new beliefs. 



















But the soul of India was to be resuscitated through a spiritual awakening. We hear the first 










call of this renascence in the spirited retort of the young Gadadhar: "Brother, what shall I do with a 










mere bread-winning education?" 



















Ramkumar could hardly understand the import of his young brother's reply. He described in 










bright colours the happy and easy life of scholars in Calcutta society. But Gadadhar intuitively felt 










that the scholars, to use one of his own vivid illustrations, were like so many vultures, soaring high 










on the wings of their uninspired intellect, with their eyes fixed on the charnel-pit of greed and lust. 










So he stood firm and Ramkumar had to give way. 



















KALI temple at dakshineswar 



















At that time there lived in Calcutta a rich widow named Rani Rasmani, belonging to the 










Sudra caste, and known far and wide not only for her business ability, courage, and intelligence, 










but also for her largeness of heart, piety, and devotion to God. She was assisted in the 










management of her vast property by her son-in-law Mathur Mohan. 



















In 1847 the Rani purchased twenty acres of land at Dakshineswar, a village about four miles 










north of Calcutta. Here she created a temple garden and constructed several temples. Her Ishta, or 










Chosen Ideal, was the Divine Mother, Kali. 



















The temple garden stands directly on the east bank of the Ganges. The northern section of 










the land and a portion to the east contain an orchard, flower gardens, and two small reservoirs. 










The southern section is paved with brick and mortar. The visitor arriving by boat ascends the steps 










of an imposing bathing-Ghat, which leads to the Chandni, a roofed terrace, on either side of which 










stand in a row six temples of Siva. East of the terrace and the Siva temples is a large court, paved, 










rectangular in shape, and running north and south. Two temples stand in the centre of this court, 










the larger one, to the south and facing south, being dedicated to Kali, and the smaller one, facing 










the Ganges, to Radhakanta, that is, Krishna, the Consort of Radha. Nine domes with spires 










surmount the temple of Kali, and before it stands the spacious Natmandir, or music hall, the 










terrace of which is supported by stately pillars. At the northwest and southwest corners of the 










temple compound are two Nahabats, or music towers, from which music flows at different times 










of day, especially at sunup, noon, and sundown, when the worship is performed in the temples. 










Three sides of the paved courtyard -all except the west - are lined with rooms set apart for 










kitchens, store-rooms, dining-rooms, and quarters for the temple staff and guests. The chamber in 










the northwest angle, just beyond the last of the Siva temples, is of special interest to us; for here 










Sri Ramakrishna was to spend a considerable part of his life. To the west of this chamber is a 










semicircular porch overlooking the river. In front of the porch runs a foot-path, north and south, 










and beyond the path is a large garden and, below the garden, the Ganges. The orchard to the 










north of the buildings contains the Panchavati, the banyan, and the bel-tree, associated with Sri 










Ramakrishna's spiritual practices. Outside and to the north of the temple compound proper is the 





































Kuthi, or bungalow, used by members of Rani Rasmani's family visiting the garden. And north of 










the temple garden, separated from it by a high wall, is a powder-magazine belonging to the British 










Government. 



















SIVA 



















In the twelve Siva temples are installed the emblems of the Great God of renunciation in His 










various aspects, worshipped daily with proper rites. Siva requires few articles of worship. White 










flowers and bel-leaves and a little Ganges water offered with devotion are enough to satisfy the 










benign Deity and win from Him the boon of liberation. 



















radhAkAnta 



















The temple of Radhakanta, also known as the temple of Vishnu, contains the images of 










Radha and Krishna, the symbol of union with God through ecstatic love. The two images stand on a 










pedestal facing the west. The floor is paved with marble. From the ceiling of the porch hang 










chandeliers protected from dust by coverings of red cloth. Canvas screens shield the images from 










the rays of the setting sun. Close to the threshold of the inner shrine is a small brass cup containing 










holy water. Devoted visitors reverently drink a few drops from the vessel. 



















kAli 



















The main temple is dedicated to Kali, the Divine Mother, here worshipped as Bhavatarini, 










the Saviour of the Universe. The floor of this temple also is paved with marble. The basalt image of 










the Mother, dressed in gorgeous gold brocade, stands on a white marble image of the prostrate 










body of Her Divine Consort, Siva, the symbol of the Absolute. On the feet of the Goddess are, 










among other ornaments, anklets of gold. Her arms are decked with jeweled ornaments of gold. 










She wears necklaces of gold and pearls, a golden garland of human heads, and a girdle of human 










arms. She wears a golden crown, golden ear-rings, and a golden nose-ring with a pearl-drop. She 










has four arms. The lower left hand holds a severed human head and the upper grips a 










blood-stained sabre. One right hand offers boons to Her children; the other allays their fear. The 










majesty of Her posture can hardly be described. It combines the terror of destruction with the 










reassurance of motherly tenderness. For She is the Cosmic Power, the totality of the universe, a 










glorious harmony of the pairs of opposites. She deals out death, as She creates and preserves. She 










has three eyes, the third being the symbol of Divine Wisdom; they strike dismay into the wicked, 










yet pour out affection for Her devotees. 



















The whole symbolic world is represented in the temple garden - the Trinity of the Nature 










Mother (Kali), the Absolute (Siva), and Love (Radhakanta), the Arch spanning heaven and earth. 










The terrific Goddess of the Tantra, the soul-enthralling Flute-Player of the Bhagavata, and the 










Self-absorbed Absolute of the Vedas live together, creating the greatest synthesis of religions. All 










aspects of Reality are represented there. But of this divine household, Kali is the pivot, the 










sovereign Mistress. She is Prakriti, the Procreatrix, Nature, the Destroyer, the Creator. Nay, She is 










something greater and deeper still for those who have eyes to see. She is the Universal Mother, 










"my Mother" as Ramakrishna would say, the All-powerful, who reveals Herself to Her children 










under different aspects and Divine Incarnations, the Visible God, who leads the elect to the 





































Invisible Reality; and if it so pleases Her, She takes away the last trace of ego from created beings 










and merges it in the consciousness of the Absolute, the undifferentiated God. Through Her grace 










"the finite ego loses itself in the illimitable Ego-Atman-Brahman". 



















Rani Rasmani spent a fortune for the construction of the temple garden and another 










fortune for its dedication ceremony, which took place on May 31, 1855. 



















Sri Ramakrishna - henceforth we shall call Gadadhar by this familiar name - came to the 










temple garden with his elder brother Ramkumar, who was appointed priest of the Kali temple. Sri 










Ramakrishna did not at first approve of Ramkumar's working for the Sudra Rasmani. The example 










of their orthodox father was still fresh in Sri Ramakrishna's mind. He objected also to the eating of 










the cooked offerings of the temple, since, according to orthodox Hindu custom, such food can be 










offered to the Deity only in the house of a brahmin. But the holy atmosphere of the temple 










grounds, the solitude of the surrounding wood, the loving care of his brother, the respect shown 










him by Rani Rasmani and Mathur 



















Babu, the living presence of the Goddess Kali in the temple, and, above all, the proximity of 










the sacred Ganges, which Sri Ramakrishna always held in the highest respect, gradually overcame 










his disapproval, and he began to feel at home. 



















Within a very short time Sri Ramakrishna attracted the notice of Mathur Babu, who was 










impressed by the young man's religious fervour and wanted him to participate in the worship in 










the Kali temple. But Sri Ramakrishna loved his freedom and was indifferent to any worldly career. 










The profession of the priesthood in a temple founded by a rich woman did not appeal to his mind. 










Further, he hesitated to take upon himself the responsibility for the ornaments and jewellery of 










the temple. Mathur had to wait for a suitable occasion. 



















At this time there came to Dakshineswar a youth of sixteen, destined to play an important 










role in Sri Ramakrishna's life. Hriday, a distant nephew of Sri Ramakrishna, hailed from Sihore, a 










village not far from Kamarpukur, and had been his boyhood friend. Clever, exceptionally energetic, 










and endowed with great presence of mind, he moved, as will be seen later, like a shadow about his 










uncle and was always ready to help him, even at the sacrifice of his personal comfort. He was 










destined to be a mute witness of many of the spiritual experiences of Sri Ramakrishna and the 










caretaker of his body during the stormy days of his spiritual practice. Hriday came to Dakshineswar 










in search of a job, and Sri Ramakrishna was glad to see him. 



















Unable to resist the persuasion of Mathur Babu, Sri Ramakrishna at last entered the temple 










service, on condition that Hriday should be asked to assist him. His first duty was to dress and 










decorate the image of Kali. 



















One day the priest of the Radhakanta temple accidentally dropped the image of Krishna on 










the floor, breaking one of its legs. The pundits advised the Rani to install a new image, since the 










worship of an image with a broken limb was against the scriptural injunctions. But the Rani was 










fond of the image, and she asked Sri Ramakrishna's opinion. In an abstracted mood, he said: "This 










solution is ridiculous. If a son-in-law of the Rani broke his leg, would she discard him and put 










another in his place? Wouldn't she rather arrange for his treatment? Why should she not do the 





































same thing in this case too? Let the image be repaired and worshipped as before." It was a simple, 










straightforward solution and was accepted by the Rani. Sri Ramakrishna himself mended the 










break. The priest was dismissed for his carelessness, and at Mathur Babu's earnest request, Sri 










Ramakrishna accepted the Office of priest in the Radhakanta temple. 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA AS A PRIEST 



















Born in an orthodox brahmin family, Sri Ramakrishna knew the formalities of worship, its 










rites and rituals. The innumerable gods and goddesses of the Hindu religion are the human aspects 










of the indescribable and incomprehensible Spirit, as conceived by the finite human mind. They 










understand and appreciate human love and emotion, help men to realize their secular and 










spiritual ideals, and ultimately enable men to attain liberation from the miseries of phenomenal 










life. The Source of light, intelligence, wisdom, and strength is the One alone from whom comes the 










fulfilment of desire. Yet, as long as a man is bound by his human limitations, he cannot but worship 










God through human forms. He must use human symbols. Therefore Hinduism asks the devotees to 










look on God as the ideal father, the ideal mother, the ideal husband, the ideal son, or the ideal 










friend. But the name ultimately leads to the Nameless, the form to the Formless, the word to the 










Silence, the emotion to the serene realization of Peace in ExistenceKnowledge-Bliss Absolute. The 










gods gradually merge in the one God. But until that realization is achieved, the devotee cannot 










dissociate human factors from his worship. Therefore the Deity is bathed and clothed and decked 










with ornaments. He is fed and put to sleep. He is propitiated with hymns, songs, and prayers. And 










there are appropriate rites connected with all these functions. For instance, to secure for himself 










external purity, the priest bathes himself in holy water and puts on a holy cloth. He purifies the 










mind and the sense organs by appropriate meditations. He fortifies the place of worship against 










evil forces by drawing around it circles of fire and water. He awakens the different spiritual centres 










of the body and invokes the Supreme Spirit in his heart. Then he transfers the Supreme Spirit to 










the image before him and worships the image, regarding it no longer as clay or stone, but as the 










embodiment of Spirit, throbbing with Life and Consciousness. After the worship the Supreme Spirit 










is recalled from the image to Its true sanctuary, the heart of the priest. The real devotee knows the 










absurdity of worshipping the Transcendental Reality with material articles - clothing That which 










pervades the whole universe and the beyond, putting on a pedestal That which cannot be limited 










by space, feeding That which is disembodied and incorporeal, singing before That whose glory the 










music of the spheres tries vainly to proclaim. But through these rites the devotee aspires to go 










ultimately beyond rites and rituals, forms and names, words and praise, and to realize God as the 










All-pervading Consciousness. 



















Hindu priests are thoroughly acquainted with the rites of worship, but few of them are 










aware of their underlying significance. They move their hands and limbs mechanically, in 










obedience to the letter of the scriptures, and repeat the holy mantras like parrots. But from the 










very beginning the inner meaning of these rites was revealed to Sri Ramakrishna. As he sat facing 










the image, a strange transformation came over his mind. While going through the prescribed 










ceremonies, he would actually find himself encircled by a wall of fire protecting him and the place 










of worship from unspiritual vibrations, or he would feel the rising of the mystic Kundalini through 





































the different centres of the body. The glow on his face, his deep absorption, and the intense 










atmosphere of the temple impressed everyone who saw him worship the Deity. 



















Ramkumar wanted Sri Ramakrishna to learn the intricate rituals of the worship of Kali. To 










become a priest of Kali one must undergo a special form of initiation from a qualified guru, and for 










Sri Ramakrishna a suitable brahmin was found. But no sooner did the brahmin speak the holy word 










in his ear than Sri Ramakrishna, overwhelmed with emotion, uttered a loud cry and plunged into 










deep concentration. 



















Mathur begged Sri Ramakrishna to take charge of the worship in the Kali temple. The young 










priest pleaded his incompetence and his ignorance of the scriptures. Mathur insisted that devotion 










and sincerity would more than compensate for any lack of formal knowledge and make the Divine 










Mother manifest Herself through the image. In the end, Sri Ramakrishna had to yield to Mathur's 










request. He became the priest of Kali. 



















In 1856 Ramkumar breathed his last. Sri Ramakrishna had already witnessed more than one 










death in the family. He had come to realize how impermanent is life on earth. The more he was 










convinced of the transitory nature of worldly things, the more eager he became to realize God, the 










Fountain of Immortality. 



















THE FIRST VISION OF KALI 



















And, indeed, he soon discovered what a strange Goddess he had chosen to serve. He 










became gradually enmeshed in the web of Her all-pervading presence. To the ignorant She is to be 










sure, the image of destruction: but he found in Her the benign, all-loving Mother. Her neck is 










encircled with a garland of heads, and Her waist with a girdle of human arms and two of Her hands 










hold weapons of death, and Her eyes dart a glance of fire; but, strangely enough, Ramakrishna 










felt in Her breath the soothing touch of tender love and saw in Her the Seed of Immortality. She 










stands on the bosom of Her Consort, Siva; it is because She is the Sakti, the Power, inseparable 










from the Absolute. She is surrounded by jackals and other unholy creatures, the denizens of the 










cremation ground. But is not the Ultimate Reality above holiness and unholiness? She appears to 










be reeling under the spell of wine. But who would create this mad world unless under the 










influence of a divine drunkenness? She is the highest symbol of all the forces of nature, the 










synthesis of their antinomies, the Ultimate Divine in the form of woman. She now became to Sri 










Ramakrishna the only Reality, and the world became an unsubstantial shadow. Into Her worship 










he poured his soul. Before him She stood as the transparent portal to the shrine of Ineffable 










Reality. 



















The worship in the temple intensified Sri Ramakrishna's yearning for a living vision of the 










Mother of the Universe. He began to spend in meditation the time not actually employed in the 










temple service; and for this purpose he selected an extremely solitary place. A deep jungle, thick 










with underbrush and prickly plants, lay to the north of the temples. Used at one time as a burial 










ground, it was shunned by people even during the day-time for fear of ghosts. There Sri 










Ramakrishna began to spend the whole night in meditation, returning to his room only in the 










morning with eyes swollen as though from much weeping. While meditating, he would lay aside 










his cloth and his brahminical thread. Explaining this strange conduct, he once said to Hriday: "Don't 





































you know that when one thinks of God one should be freed from all ties? From our very birth we 










have the eight fetters of hatred, shame, lineage, pride of good conduct, fear, secretiveness, caste, 










and grief. The sacred thread reminds me that I am a brahmin and therefore superior to all. When 










calling on the Mother one has to set aside all such ideas." Hriday thought his uncle was becoming 










insane. 



















As his love for God deepened, he began either to forget or to drop the formalities of 










worship. Sitting before the image, he would spend hours singing the devotional songs of great 










devotees of the Mother, such as Kamalakanta and Ramprasad. Those rhapsodical songs, describing 










the direct vision of God, only intensified Sri Ramakrishna's longing. He felt the pangs of a child 










separated from its mother. Sometimes, in agony, he would rub his face against the ground and 










weep so bitterly that people, thinking he had lost his earthly mother, would sympathize with him 










in his grief. Sometimes, in moments of scepticism, he would cry: "Art Thou true, Mother, or is it all 










fiction -mere poetry without any reality? If Thou dost exist, why do I not see Thee? Is religion a 










mere fantasy and art Thou only a figment of man's imagination?" Sometimes he would sit on the 










prayer carpet for two hours like an inert object. He began to behave in an abnormal manner, most 










of the time unconscious of the world. He almost gave up food; and sleep left him altogether. 



















But he did not have to wait very long. He has thus described his first vision of the Mother: "I 










felt as if my heart were being squeezed like a wet towel. I was overpowered with a great 










restlessness and a fear that it might not be my lot to realize Her in this life. I could not bear the 










separation from Her any longer. Life seemed to be not worth living. Suddenly my glance fell on the 










sword that was kept in the Mother's temple. I determined to put an end to my life. When I jumped 










up like a madman and seized it, suddenly the blessed Mother revealed Herself. The buildings with 










their different parts, the temple, and everything else vanished from my sight, leaving no trace 










whatsoever, and in their stead I saw a limitless, infinite, effulgent Ocean of Consciousness. As far 










as the eye could see, the shining billows were madly rushing at me from all sides with a terrific 










noise, to swallow me up! I was panting for breath. I was caught in the rush and collapsed, 










unconscious. What was happening in the outside world I did not know; but within me there was a 










steady flow of undiluted bliss, altogether new, and I felt the presence of the Divine Mother." On 










his lips when he regained consciousness of the world was the word "Mother". 



















GOD-INTOXICATED STATE 



















Yet this was only a foretaste of the intense experiences to come. The first glimpse of the 










Divine Mother made him the more eager for Her uninterrupted vision. He wanted to see Her both 










in meditation and with eyes open. But the Mother began to play a teasing game of hide-and-seek 










with him, intensifying both his joy and his suffering. Weeping bitterly during the moments of 










separation from Her, he would pass into a trance and then find Her standing before him, smiling, 










talking, consoling, bidding him be of good cheer, and instructing him. During this period of spiritual 










practice he had many uncommon experiences. When he sat to meditate, he would hear strange 










clicking sounds in the joints of his legs, as if someone were locking them up, one after the other, to 










keep him motionless; and at the conclusion of his meditation he would again hear the same 










sounds, this time unlocking them and leaving him free to move about. He would see flashes like a 










swarm of fire-flies floating before his eyes, or a sea of deep mist around him, with luminous waves 





































of molten silver. Again, from a sea of translucent mist he would behold the Mother rising, first Her 










feet, then Her waist, body, face, and head, finally Her whole person; he would feel Her breath and 










hear Her voice. Worshipping in the temple, sometimes he would become exalted, sometimes he 










would remain motionless as stone, sometimes he would almost collapse from excessive emotion. 










Many of his actions, contrary to all tradition, seemed sacrilegious to the people. He would take a 










flower and touch it to his own head, body, and feet, and then offer it to the Goddess. Or, like a 










drunkard, he would reel to the throne of the Mother, touch Her chin by way of showing his 










affection for Her, and sing, talk, joke, laugh, and dance. Or he would take a morsel of food from 










the plate and hold it to Her mouth, begging Her to eat it, and would not be satisfied till he was 










convinced that She had really eaten. After the Mother had been put to sleep at night, from his own 










room he would hear Her ascending to the upper storey of the temple with the light steps of a 










happy girl, Her anklets jingling. Then he would discover Her standing with flowing hair, Her black 










form silhouetted against the sky of the night looking at the Ganges or at the distant lights of 










Calcutta. 



















Naturally the temple officials took him for an insane person. His worldly well-wishers 










brought him to skilled physicians; but no medicine could cure his malady. Many a time he doubted 










his sanity himself. For he had been sailing across an uncharted sea, with no earthly guide to direct 










him. His only haven of security was the Divine Mother Herself. To Her he would pray: "I do not 










know what these things are. I am ignorant of mantras and the scriptures. Teach me, Mother, how 










to realize Thee. Who else can help me? Art Thou not my only refuge and guide?" And the 










sustaining presence of the Mother never failed him in his distress or doubt. Even those who 










criticized his conduct were greatly impressed with his purity, guilelessness, truthfulness, integrity, 










and holiness. They felt an uplifting influence in his presence. 



















It is said that Samadhi, or trance, no more than opens the portal of the spiritual realm. Sri 










Ramakrishna felt an unquenchable desire to enjoy God in various ways. For his meditation he built 










a place in the northern wooded section of the temple garden. With Hriday's help he planted there 










five sacred trees. The spot, known as the Panchavati, became the scene of many of his visions. 



















As his spiritual mood deepened he more and more felt himself to be a child of the Divine 










Mother. He learnt to surrender himself completely to Her will and let Her direct him. 



















"0 Mother," he would constantly pray, "I have taken refuge in Thee. Teach me what to do 










and what to say. Thy will is paramount everywhere and is for the good of Thy children. Merge my 










will in Thy will and make me Thy instrument." 



















His visions became deeper and more intimate. He no longer had to meditate to behold the 










Divine Mother. Even while retaining consciousness of the outer world, he would see Her as 










tangibly as the temples, the trees, the river, and the men around him. 



















On a certain occasion Mathur Babu stealthily entered the temple to watch the worship. He 










was profoundly moved by the young priest's devotion and sincerity. He realized that Sri 










Ramakrishna had transformed the stone image into the living Goddess. 





































Sri Ramakrishna one day fed a cat with the food that was to be offered to Kali. This was too 










much for the manager of the temple garden, who considered himself responsible for the proper 










conduct of the worship. He reported Sri Ramakrishna's insane behaviour to Mathur Babu. 



















Sri Ramakrishna has described the incident: "The Divine Mother revealed to me in the Kali 










temple that it was She who had become everything. She showed me that everything was full of 










Consciousness. The image was Consciousness, the altar was Consciousness, the water-vessels were 










Consciousness, the door-sill was Consciousness, the marble floor was Consciousness - all was 










Consciousness. I found everything inside the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss - the Bliss of God. I 










saw a wicked man in front of the Kali temple; but in him also I saw the power of the Divine Mother 










vibrating. That was why I fed a cat with the food that was to be offered to the Divine Mother. I 










clearly perceived that all this was the Divine Mother - even the cat. The manager of the temple 










garden wrote to Mathur Babu saying that I was feeding the cat with the offering intended for the 










Divine Mother. But Mathur Babu had insight into the state of my mind. He wrote back to the 










manager: 'Let him do whatever he likes. You must not say anything to him.' " 



















One of the painful ailments from which Sri Ramakrishna suffered at this time was a burning 










sensation in his body, and he was cured by a strange vision. During worship in the temple, 










following the scriptural injunctions, he would imagine the presence of the "sinner" in himself and 










the destruction of this "sinner". One day he was meditating in the Panchavati, when he saw come 










out of him a red-eyed man of black complexion, reeling like a drunkard. Soon there emerged from 










him another person, of serene countenance, wearing the ochre cloth of a sannyasi and carrying in 










his hand a trident. The second person attacked the first and killed him with the trident. Thereafter 










Sri Ramakrishna was free of his pain. 



















About this time he began to worship God by assuming the attitude of a servant toward his 










master. He imitated the mood of Hanuman, the monkey chieftain of the Ramayana, the ideal 










servant of Rama and traditional model for this self-effacing form of devotion. When he meditated 










on Hanuman his movements and his way of life began to resemble those of a monkey. His eyes 










became restless. He lived on fruits and roots. With his cloth tied around his waist, a portion of it 










hanging in the form of a tail, he jumped from place to place instead of walking. And after a short 










while he was blessed with a vision of Sita, the divine consort of Rama, who entered his body and 










disappeared there with the words, "I bequeath to you my smile." 



















Mathur had faith in the sincerity of Sri Ramakrishna's spiritual zeal, but began now to doubt 










his sanity. He had watched him jumping about like a monkey. One day, when Rani Rasmani was 










listening to Sri Ramakrishna's singing in the temple, the young priest abruptly turned and slapped 










her. Apparently listening to his song, she had actually been thinking of a lawsuit. She accepted the 










punishment as though the Divine Mother Herself had imposed it; but Mathur was distressed. He 










begged Sri Ramakrishna to keep his feelings under control and to heed the conventions of society. 










God Himself, he argued, follows laws. God never permitted, for instance, flowers of two colours to 










grow on the same stalk. The following day Sri Ramakrishna presented Mathur Babu with two 










hibiscus flowers growing on the same stalk, one red and one white. 





































Mathur and Rani Rasmani began to ascribe the mental ailment of Sri Ramakrishna in part, at 










least, to his observance of rigid continence. Thinking that a natural life would relax the tension of 










his nerves, they engineered a plan with two women of ill fame. But as soon as the women entered 










his room, Sri Ramakrishna beheld in them the manifestation of the Divine Mother of the Universe 










and went into Samadhi uttering Her name. 



















haladhAri 



















In 1858 there came to Dakshineswar a cousin of Sri Ramakrishna, Haladhari by name, who 










was to remain there about eight years. On account of Sri Ramakrishna's indifferent health, Mathur 










appointed this man to the office of priest in the Kali temple. He was a complex character, versed in 










the letter of the scriptures, but hardly aware of their spirit. He loved to participate in hair-splitting 










theological discussions and, by the measure of his own erudition, he proceeded to gauge Sri 










Ramakrishna. An orthodox brahmin, he thoroughly disapproved of his cousin's unorthodox actions, 










but he was not unimpressed by Sri Ramakrishna's purity of life, ecstatic love of God, and yearning 










for realization. 



















One day Haladhari upset Sri Ramakrishna with the statement that God is incomprehensible 










to the human mind. Sri Ramakrishna has described the great moment of doubt when he wondered 










whether his visions had really misled him: "With sobs I prayed to the Mother, 'Canst Thou have the 










heart to deceive me like this because I am a fool?' A stream of tears flowed from my eyes. Shortly 










afterwards I saw a volume of mist rising from the floor and filling the space before me. In the midst 










of it there appeared a face with flowing beard, calm, highly expressive, and fair. Fixing its gaze 










steadily upon me, it said solemnly, 'Remain in Bhava-mukha, on the threshold of relative 










consciousness.' This it repeated three times and then it gently disappeared in the mist, which itself 










dissolved. This vision reassured me." 



















A garbled report of Sri Ramakrishna's failing health, indifference to worldly life, and various 










abnormal activities reached Kamarpukur and filled the heart of his poor mother with anguish. At 










her repeated request he returned to his village for a change of air. But his boyhood friends did not 










interest him any more. A divine fever was consuming him. He spent a great part of the day and 










night in one of the cremation grounds, in meditation. The place reminded him of the 










impermanence of the human body, of human hopes and achievements. It also reminded him of 










Kali, the Goddess of destruction. 



















MARRIAGE AND AFTER 



















But in a few months his health showed improvement, and he recovered to some extent his 










natural buoyancy of spirit. His happy mother was encouraged to think it might be a good time to 










arrange his marriage. The boy was now twenty-three years old. A wife would bring him back to 










earth. And she was delighted when her son welcomed her suggestion. Perhaps he saw in it the 










finger of God. 



















Saradamani, a little girl of five, lived in the neighbouring village called Jayrambati. Even at 










this age she had been praying to God to make her character as stainless and fragrant as the white 










tuberose. Looking at the full moon, she would say: "0 God, there are dark spots even on the 





































moon. But make my character spotless." It was she who was selected as the bride for Sri 










Ramakrishna. 



















The marriage ceremony was duly performed. Such early marriage in India is in the nature of 










a betrothal, the marriage being consummated when the girl attains puberty. But in this case the 










marriage remained for ever unconsummated. Sri Ramakrishna lived at Kamarpukur about a year 










and a half and then returned to Dakshineswar. 



















Hardly had he crossed the threshold of the Kali temple when he found himself again in the 










whirlwind. His madness reappeared tenfold. The same meditation and prayer, the same ecstatic 










moods, the same burning sensation, the same weeping, the same sleeplessness, the same 










indifference to the body and the outside world, the same divine delirium. He subjected himself to 










fresh disciplines in order to eradicate greed and lust, the two great impediments to spiritual 










progress. With a rupee in one hand and some earth in the other, he would reflect on the 










comparative value of these two for the realization of God, and finding them equally worthless he 










would toss them, with equal indifference, into the Ganges. Women he regarded as the 










manifestations of the Divine Mother. Never even in a dream did he feel the impulses of lust. And 










to root out of his mind the idea of caste superiority, he cleaned a pariah's house with his long and 










neglected hair. When he would sit in meditation, birds would perch on his head and peck in his 










hair for grains of food. Snakes would crawl over his body, and neither would he aware of the 










other. Sleep left him altogether. Day and night, visions flitted before him. He saw the sannyasi who 










had previously killed the "sinner" in him again coming out of his body, threatening him with the 










trident, and ordering him to concentrate on God. Or the same sannyasi would visit distant places, 










following a luminous path, and bring him reports of what was happening there. Sri Ramakrishna 










used to say later that in the case of an advanced devotee the mind itself becomes the guru, living 










and moving like an embodied being. 



















Rani Rasmani, the foundress of the temple garden, passed away in 1861. After her death 










her son-in-law Mathur became the sole executor of the estate. He placed himself and his 










resources at the disposal of Sri Ramakrishna and began to look after his physical comfort. Sri 










Ramakrishna later spoke of him as one of his five "suppliers of stores" appointed by the Divine 










Mother. Whenever a desire arose in his mind, Mathur fulfilled it without hesitation. 



















THE BRAHMANI 



















There came to Dakshineswar at this time a brahmin woman who was to play an important 










part in Sri Ramakrishna's spiritual unfoldment. Born in East Bengal, she was an adept in the Tantrik 










and Vaishnava methods of worship. She was slightly over fifty years of age, handsome, and garbed 










in the orange robe of a nun. Her sole possessions were a few books and two pieces of 










wearing-cloth. 



















Sri Ramakrishna welcomed the visitor with great respect, described to her his experiences 










and visions, and told her of people's belief that these were symptoms of madness. She listened to 










him attentively and said: "My son, everyone in this world is mad. Some are mad for money, some 










for creature comforts, some for name and fame; and you are mad for God." She assured him that 










he was passing through the almost unknown spiritual experience described in the scriptures as 





































Maha-bhava, the most exalted rapture of divine love. She told him that this extreme exaltation 










had been described as manifesting itself through nineteen physical symptoms, including the 










shedding of tears, a tremor of the body, horripilation, perspiration, and a burning sensation. The 










Bhakti scriptures, she declared, had recorded only two instances of the experience, namely, those 










of Sri Radha and Sri Chaitanya. 



















Very soon a tender relationship sprang up between Sri Ramakrishna and the Brahmani, she 










looking upon him as the Baby Krishna, and he upon her as mother. Day after day, she watched his 










ecstasy during the kirtan and meditation, his Samadhi, his mad yearning; and she recognized in 










him a power to transmit spirituality to others. She came to the conclusion that such things were 










not possible for an ordinary devotee, not even for a highly developed soul. Only an Incarnation of 










God was capable of such spiritual manifestations. She proclaimed openly that Sri Ramakrishna, like 










Sri Chaitanya, was an Incarnation of God. 



















When Sri Ramakrishna told Mathur what the Brahmani had said about him, Mathur shook 










his head in doubt. He was reluctant to accept him as an Incarnation of God, an Avatar comparable 










to Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and Chaitanya, though he admitted Sri Ramakrishna's extraordinary 










spirituality. Whereupon the Brahmani asked Mathur to arrange a conference of scholars who 










should discuss the matter with her. He agreed to the proposal and the meeting was arranged. It 










was to be held in the Natmandir in front of the Kali temple. 



















Two famous pundits of the time were invited: Vaishnavcharan, the leader of the Vaishnava 










society, and Gauri. The first to arrive was Vaishnavcharan, with a distinguished company of 










scholars and devotees. The Brahmani, like a proud mother, proclaimed her view before him and 










supported it with quotations from the scriptures. As the pundits discussed the deep theological 










question, Sri Ramakrishna, perfectly indifferent to everything happening around him, sat in their 










midst like a child, immersed in his own thoughts, sometimes smiling, sometimes chewing a pinch 










of spices from a pouch, or again saying to Vaishnavcharan with a nudge: "Look here. Sometimes I 










feel like this, too." Presently Vaishnavcharan arose to declare himself in total agreement with the 










view of the Brahmani. He declared that Sri Ramakrishna had undoubtedly experienced 










Maha-bhava and that this was the certain sign of the rare manifestation of God in a man. The 










people assembled there, especially the officers of the temple garden, were struck dumb. Sri 










Ramakrishna said to Mathur, like a boy: "Just fancy, he too says so! Well, I am glad to learn that, 










after all, it is not a disease." 



















When, a few days later, Pundit Gauri arrived, another meeting was held, and he agreed with 










the view of the Brahmani and Vaishnavcharan. To Sri Ramakrishna's remark that Vaishnavcharan 










had declared him to be an Avatar, Gauri replied: "Is that all he has to say about you? Then he has 










said very little. I am fully convinced that you are that Mine of Spiritual Power, only a small fraction 










of which descends on earth, from time to time, in the form of an Incarnation." 



















"Ah!" said Sri Ramakrishna with a smile, "You seem to have quite outbid Vaishnavcharan in 










this matter. What have you found in me that makes you entertain such an idea?" 



















Gauri said: "I feel it in my heart and I have the scriptures on my side. I am ready to prove it 










to anyone who challenges me." 





































"Well," Sri Ramakrishna said, "it is you who say so; but, believe me, I know nothing about 



















it." 



















Thus, the insane priest was, by verdict of the great scholars of the day, proclaimed a Divine 










Incarnation. His visions were not the result of an over heated brain; they had precedent in spiritual 










history. And how did the proclamation affect Sri Ramakrishna himself? He remained the simple 










child of the Mother that he had been since the first day of his life. Years later, when two of his 










householder disciples openly spoke of him as a Divine Incarnation and the matter was reported to 










him, he said with a touch of sarcasm: "Do they think they will enhance my glory that way? One of 










them is an actor on the stage and the other a physician. What do they know about Incarnations? 










Why years ago pundits like Gauri and Vaishnavcharan declared me to be an Avatar. They were 










great scholars and knew what they said. But that did not make any change in my mind." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was a learner all his life. He often used to quote a proverb to his disciples: 










"Friend, the more I live the more I learn." When the excitement created by the Brahmani's 










declaration was over, he set himself to the task of practising spiritual disciplines according to the 










traditional methods laid down in the Tantra and Vaishnava scriptures. Hitherto he had pursued his 










spiritual ideal according to the promptings of his own mind and heart. Now he accepted the 










Brahmani as his guru and set foot on the traditional highways. 



















TANTRA 



















According to the Tantra, the Ultimate Reality is Chit, or Consciousness, which is identical 










with Sat, or Being, and with Ananda, or Bliss. This Ultimate Reality, Satchidananda, 










Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, is identical with the Reality preached in the Vedas. And man 










is identical with this Reality; but under the influence of Maya, or illusion, he has forgotten his true 










nature. He takes to be real a merely apparent world of subject and object, and this error is the 










cause of his bondage and suffering. The goal of spiritual discipline is the rediscovery of his true 










identity with the divine Reality. 



















For the achievement of this goal the Vedanta prescribes an austere negative method of 










discrimination and renunciation, which can be followed by only a few individuals endowed with 










sharp intelligence and unshakeable will-power. But Tantra takes into consideration the natural 










weakness of human beings, their lower appetites, and their love for the concrete. It combines 










philosophy with rituals, meditation with ceremonies, renunciation with enjoyment. The underlying 










purpose is gradually to train the aspirant to meditate on his identity with the Ultimate. 



















The average man wishes to enjoy the material objects of the world. Tantra bids him enjoy 










these, but at the same time, discover in them the presence of God. Mystical rites are prescribed by 










which, slowly, the sense objects become spiritualized and sense attraction is transformed into a 










love of God. So the very "bonds" of man are turned into "releasers". The very poison that kills is 










transmuted into the elixir of life. Outward renunciation is not necessary. Thus, the aim of Tantra is 










to sublimate Bhoga, or enjoyment, into Yoga, or union with Consciousness. For, according to this 










philosophy, the world with all its manifestations is nothing but the sport of Siva and Sakti, the 










Absolute and Its inscrutable Power. 





































33 





































The disciplines of Tantra are graded to suit aspirants of all degrees. Exercises are prescribed 










for people with "animal", "heroic", and "divine" outlooks. Certain of the rites require the presence 










of members of the opposite sex. Here the aspirant learns to look on woman as the embodiment of 










the Goddess Kali, the Mother of the Universe. The very basis of Tantra is the Motherhood of God 










and the glorification of woman. Every part of a woman's body is to be regarded as incarnate 










Divinity. But the rites are extremely dangerous. The help of a qualified guru is absolutely 










necessary. An unwary devotee may lose his foothold and fall into a pit of depravity. 



















According to the Tantra, Sakti is the active creative force in the universe. Siva, the Absolute, 










is a more or less passive principle. Further, Sakti is as inseparable from Siva as fire's power to burn 










is from fire itself. Sakti, the Creative Power, contains in Its womb the universe, and therefore is the 










Divine Mother. All women are Her symbols. Kali is one of Her several forms. The meditation on 










Kali, the Creative Power, is the central discipline of the Tantra. While meditating, the aspirant at 










first regards himself as one with the Absolute and then thinks that out of that Impersonal 










Consciousness emerge two entities, namely, his own self and the living form of the Goddess. He 










then projects the Goddess into the tangible image before him and worships it as the Divine 










Mother. 



















Sri Ramakrishna set himself to the task of practising the disciplines of Tantra; and at the 










bidding of the Divine Mother Herself he accepted the Brahmani as his guru. He performed 










profound and delicate ceremonies in the Panchavati and under the bel-tree at the northern 










extremity of the temple compound. He practised all the disciplines of the sixty-four principal 










Tantra books, and it took him never more than three days to achieve the result promised in any 










one of them. After the observance of a few preliminary rites, he would be overwhelmed with a 










strange divine fervour and would go into Samadhi, where his mind would dwell in exaltation. Evil 










ceased to exist for him. The word "carnal" lost its meaning. The whole world and everything in it 










appeared as the Lila, the sport, of Siva and Sakti. He beheld everywhere manifest the power and 










beauty of the Mother, the whole world, animate and inanimate, appeared to him as pervaded with 










Chit, Consciousness, and with Ananda, Bliss. 



















He saw in a vision the Ultimate Cause of the universe as a huge luminous triangle giving 










birth every moment to an infinite number of worlds. He heard the Anahata Sabda, the great sound 










Om, of which the innumerable sounds of the universe are only so many echoes. He acquired the 










eight supernatural powers of Yoga, which make a man almost omnipotent, and these he spurned 










as of no value whatsoever to the Spirit. He had a vision of the divine Maya, the inscrutable Power 










of God, by which the universe is created and sustained, and into which it is finally absorbed. In this 










vision he saw a woman of exquisite beauty, about to become a mother, emerging from the Ganges 










and slowly approaching the Panchavati. Presently she gave birth to a child and began to nurse it 










tenderly. A moment later she assumed a terrible aspect, seized the child with her grim jaws and 










crushed it. Swallowing it, she re-entered the waters of the Ganges. 



















But the most remarkable experience during this period was the awakening of the Kundalini 










Sakti, the "Serpent Power". He actually saw the Power, at first lying asleep at the bottom of the 





































spinal column, then waking up and ascending along the mystic Sushumna canal and through its six 










centres, or lotuses, to the Sahasrara, the thousand-petalled lotus in the top of the head. He further 










saw that as the Kundalini went upward the different lotuses bloomed. And this phenomenon was 










accompanied by visions and trances. Later on he described to his disciples and devotees the 










various movements of the Kundalini: the fishlike, birdlike, monkey like, and so on. The awakening 










of the Kundalini is the beginning of spiritual consciousness, and its union with Siva in the 










Sahasrara, ending in Samadhi, is the consummation of the Tantrik disciplines. 



















About this time it was revealed to him that in a short while many devotees would seek his 










guidance. 



















VAISHNAVA DISCIPLINES 



















After completing the Tantrik sadhana Sri Ramakrishna followed the Brahmani in the 










disciplines of Vaishnavism. The Vaishnavas are worshippers of Vishnu, the "Allpervading", the 










Supreme God, who is also known as Hari and Narayana. Of Vishnu's various Incarnations the two 










with the largest number of followers are Rama and Krishna. 



















Vaishnavism is exclusively a religion of bhakti. Bhakti is intense love of God, attachment to 










Him alone; it is of the nature of bliss and bestows upon the lover immortality and liberation. God, 










according to Vaishnavism, cannot be realized through logic or reason; and, without bhakti, all 










penances, austerities, and rites are futile. Man cannot realize God by self-exertion alone. For the 










vision of God His grace is absolutely necessary, and this grace is felt by the pure of heart. The mind 










is to be purified through bhakti. The pure mind then remains for ever immersed in the ecstasy of 










God-vision. It is the cultivation of this divine love that is the chief concern of the Vaishnava 










religion. 



















There are three kinds of formal devotion: tamasic, rajasic, and sattvic. If a person, while 










showing devotion to God, is actuated by malevolence, arrogance, jealousy, or anger, then his 










devotion is tamasic, since it is influenced by tamas, the quality of inertia. If he worships God from a 










desire for fame or wealth, or from any other worldly ambition, then his devotion is rajasic, since it 










is influenced by rajas, the quality of activity. But if a person loves God without any thought of 










material gain, if he performs his duties to please God alone and maintains toward all created 










beings the attitude of friendship, then his devotion is called sattvic, since it is influenced by sattva, 










the quality of harmony. But the highest devotion transcends the three gunas, or qualities, being a 










spontaneous, uninterrupted inclination of the mind toward God, the Inner Soul of all beings; and it 










wells up in the heart of a true devotee as soon as he hears the name of God or mention of God's 










attributes. A devotee possessed of this love would not accept the happiness of heaven if it were 










offered him. His one desire is to love God under all conditions -in pleasure and pain, life and death, 










honour and dishonour, prosperity and adversity. 



















There are two stages of bhakti. The first is known as Vaidhi— Bhakti, or love of God qualified 










by scriptural injunctions. For the devotees of this stage are prescribed regular and methodical 










worship, hymns, prayers, the repetition of God's name, and the chanting of His glories. This lower 










bhakti in course of time matures into Para-Bhakti, or supreme devotion, known also as Prema, the 





































most intense form of divine love. Divine love is an end in itself. It exists potentially in all human 










hearts, but in the case of bound creatures it is misdirected to earthly objects. 



















To develop the devotee's love for God, Vaishnavism humanises God. God is to be regarded 










as the devotee's Parent, Master, Friend, Child, Husband, or Sweetheart, each succeeding 










relationship representing an intensification of love. These Bhavas, or attitudes toward God, are 










known as Santa, Dasya, Sakhya, Vatsalya, and Madhur. The rishis of the Vedas, Hanuman, the 










cowherd boys of Vrindavan, Rama's mother Kausalya, and Radhika, Krishna's sweetheart, 










exhibited, respectively, the most perfect examples of these forms. In the ascending scale the 










glories of God are gradually forgotten and the devotee realizes more and more the intimacy of 










divine communion. Finally he regards himself as the mistress of his Beloved, and no artificial 










barrier remains to separate him from his Ideal. No social or moral obligation can bind to the earth 










his soaring spirit. He experiences perfect union with the Godhead. Unlike the Vedantist, who 










strives to transcend all varieties of the subject-object relationship, a devotee of the Vaishnava path 










wishes to retain both his own individuality and the personality of God. To him God is not an 










intangible Absolute, but the Purushottama, the Supreme Person. 



















While practising the discipline of the Madhur Bhava, the male devotee often regards 










himself as a woman, in order to develop the most intense form of love for Sri Krishna, the only 










Purusha, or man, in the universe. This assumption of the attitude of the opposite sex has a deep 










psychological significance. It is a matter of common experience that an idea may be cultivated to 










such an intense degree that every idea alien to it is driven from the mind. This peculiarity of the 










mind may he utilised for the subjugation of the lower desires and the development of the spiritual 










nature. Now, the idea which is the basis of all desires and passions in a man is the conviction of his 










indissoluble association with a male body. If he can inoculate himself thoroughly with the idea that 










he is a woman, he can get rid of the desires peculiar to his male body. Again, the idea that he is a 










woman may in turn be made to give way to another higher idea, namely, that he is neither man 










nor woman, but the Impersonal Spirit. The Impersonal Spirit alone can enjoy real communion with 










the Impersonal God. Hence the highest realization of the Vaishnava draws close to the 










transcendental experience of the Vedantist. 



















A beautiful expression of the Vaishnava worship of God through love is to be found in the 










Vrindavan episode of the Bhagavata. The gopis, or milk-maids, of Vrindavan regarded the 










six-year-old Krishna as their Beloved. They sought no personal gain or happiness from this love. 










They surrendered to Krishna their bodies, minds, and souls. Of all the gopis, Radhika, or Radha, 










because of her intense love for Him, was the closest to Krishna. She manifested Maha-bhava and 










was united with her Beloved. This union represents, through sensuous language, a supersensuous 










experience. 



















Sri Chaitanya, also known as Gauranga, Gora, or Nimai, born in Bengal in 1485 and regarded 










as an Incarnation of God, is a great prophet of the Vaishnava religion. Chaitanya declared the 










chanting of God's name to be the most efficacious spiritual discipline for the Kali-Yuga. 





































Sri Ramakrishna, as the monkey Hanuman, had already worshipped God as his Master. 










Through his devotion to Kali he had worshipped God as his Mother. He was now to take up the 










other relationships prescribed by the Vaishnava scriptures. 



















ramlAlA 



















About the year 1864 there came to Dakshineswar a wandering Vaishnava monk, Jatadhari, 










whose Ideal Deity was Rama. He always carried with him a small metal image of the Deity, which 










he called by the endearing name of Ramlala, the Boy Rama. Toward this little image he displayed 










the tender affection of Kausalya for her divine Son, Rama. As a result of lifelong spiritual practice 










he had actually found in the metal image the presence of his Ideal. Ramlala was no longer for him 










a metal image, but the living God. He devoted himself to nursing Rama, feeding Rama, playing with 










Rama, taking Rama for a walk, and bathing Rama. And he found that the image responded to his 










love. 



















Sri Ramakrishna, much impressed with his devotion, requested Jatadhari to spend a few 










days at Dakshineswar. Soon Ramlala became the favourite companion of Sri Ramakrishna too. 










Later on he described to the devotees how the little image would dance gracefully before him, 










jump on his back, insist on being taken in his arms, run to the fields in the sun, pluck flowers from 










the bushes, and play pranks like a naughty boy. A very sweet relationship sprang up between him 










and Ramlala, for whom he felt the love of a mother. 



















One day Jatadhari requested Sri Ramakrishna to keep the image and bade him adieu with 










tearful eyes. He declared that Ramlala had fulfilled his innermost prayer and that he now had no 










more need of formal worship. A few days later Sri Ramakrishna was blessed through Ramlala with 










a vision of Ramachandra, whereby he realized that the Rama of the Ramayana, the son of 










Dasaratha, pervades the whole universe as Spirit and Consciousness; that He is its Creator, 










Sustainer, and Destroyer; that, in still another aspect, He is the transcendental Brahman, without 










form, attribute, or name. 



















While worshipping Ramlala as the Divine Child, Sri Ramakrishna's heart became filled with 










motherly tenderness, and he began to regard himself as a woman. His speech and gestures 










changed. He began to move freely with the ladies of Mathur's family, who now looked upon him as 










one of their own sex. During this time he worshipped the Divine Mother as Her companion or 










handmaid. 



















IN COMMUNION WITH THE DIVINE BELOVED 



















Sri Ramakrishna now devoted himself to scaling the most inaccessible and dizzy heights of 










dualistic worship, namely, the complete union with Sri Krishna as the Beloved of the heart. He 










regarded himself as one of the gopis of Vrindavan, mad with longing for her divine Sweetheart. At 










his request Mathur provided him with woman's dress and jewellery. In this love pursuit, food and 










drink were forgotten. Day and night he wept bitterly. The yearning turned into a mad frenzy; for 










the divine Krishna began to play with him the old tricks He had played with the gopis. He would 










tease and taunt, now and then revealing Himself, but always keeping at a distance. Sri 










Ramakrishna's anguish brought on a return of the old physical symptoms: the burning sensation, 





































an oozing of blood through the pores, a loosening of the joints, and the stopping of physiological 










functions. 



















The Vaishnava scriptures advise one to propitiate Radha and obtain her grace in order to 










realize Sri Krishna. So the tortured devotee now turned his prayer to her. Within a short time he 










enjoyed her blessed vision. He saw and felt the figure of Radha disappearing into his own body. 



















He said later on: "It is impossible to describe the heavenly beauty and sweetness of Radha. 










Her very appearance showed that she had completely forgotten herself in her passionate 










attachment to Krishna. Her complexion was a light yellow." 



















Now one with Radha, he manifested the great ecstatic love, the Maha-bhava which had 










found in her its fullest expression. Later Sri Ramakrishna said: "The manifestation in the same 










individual of the nineteen different kinds of emotion for God is called, in the books on bhakti, 










Maha-bhava. An ordinary man takes a whole lifetime to express even a single one of these. But in 










this body [meaning himself] there has been a complete manifestation of all nineteen." 



















The love of Radha is the precursor of the resplendent vision of Sri Krishna, and Sri 










Ramakrishna soon experienced that vision. The enchanting form of Krishna appeared to him and 










merged in his person. He became Krishna; he totally forgot his own individuality and the world; he 










saw Krishna in himself and in the universe. Thus he attained to the fulfilment of the worship of the 










Personal God. He drank from the fountain of Immortal Bliss. The agony of his heart vanished 










forever. He realized Amrita, Immortality, beyond the shadow of death. 



















One day, listening to a recitation of the Bhagavata on the verandah of the Radhakanta 










temple he fell into a divine mood and saw the enchanting form of Krishna. He perceived the 










luminous rays issuing from Krishna's Lotus Feet in the form of a stout rope, which touched first 










the Bhagavata and then his own chest, connecting all three - God, the scripture, and the devotee. 










"After this vision," he used to say, "I came to realize that Bhagavan-Bhakta-and-Bhagavata 










-God-Devotee-and-Scripture -are in reality, one and the same." 



















vedAnta 



















The Brahmani was the enthusiastic teacher and astonished beholder of Sri Ramakrishna in 










his spiritual progress. She became proud of the achievements of her unique pupil. But the pupil 










himself was not permitted to rest; his destiny beckoned him forward. His Divine Mother would 










allow him no respite till he had left behind the entire realm of duality with its visions, experiences, 










and ecstatic dreams. But for the new ascent the old tender guides would not suffice. The 










Brahmani, on whom he had depended for three years saw her son escape from her to follow the 










command of a teacher with masculine strength, a sterner mien, a gnarled physique, and a virile 










voice. The new guru was a wandering monk, the sturdy Totapuri, whom Sri Ramakrishna learnt to 










address affectionately as Nangta, the "Naked One", because of his total renunciation of all earthly 










objects and attachments, including even a piece of wearing-cloth. 



















Totapuri was the bearer of a philosophy new to Sri Ramakrishna, the non-dualistic Vedanta 










philosophy, whose conclusions Totapuri had experienced in his own life. This ancient Hindu system 










designates the Ultimate Reality as Brahman, also described as Satchidananda, 





































Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Brahman is the only Real Existence. In It there is no time, no 










space, no causality, no multiplicity. But through Maya, Its inscrutable Power, time, space, and 










causality are created and the One appears to break into the many. The eternal Spirit appears as a 










manifold of individuals endowed with form and subject to the conditions of time. The Immortal 










becomes a victim of birth and death. The Changeless undergoes change. The sinless Pure Soul, 










hypnotised by Its own Maya, experiences the joys of heaven and the pains of hell. But these 










experiences based on the duality of the subject -object relationship are unreal. Even the vision of a 










Personal God is, ultimately speaking, as illusory as the experience of any other object. Man attains 










his liberation, therefore, by piercing the veil of Maya and rediscovering his total identity with 










Brahman. Knowing himself to be one with the Universal Spirit, he realizes ineffable Peace. Only 










then does he go beyond the fiction of birth and death; only then does he become immortal. And 










this is the ultimate goal of all religions - to dehypnotize the soul now hypnotized by its own 










ignorance. 



















The path of the Vedantic discipline is the path of negation, "Neti", in which, by stern 










determination, all that is unreal is both negated and renounced. It is the path of jnana, knowledge, 










the direct method of realizing the Absolute. After the negation of everything relative, including the 










discriminating ego itself, the aspirant merges in the One without a Second, in the bliss of nirvikalpa 










Samadhi, where subject and object are alike dissolved. The soul goes beyond the realm of thought. 










The domain of duality is transcended. Maya is left behind with all its changes and modifications. 










The Real Man towers above the delusions of creation, preservation, and destruction. An avalanche 










of indescribable Bliss sweeps away all relative ideas of pain and pleasure, good and evil. There 










shines in the heart the glory of the Eternal Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Knower, 










knowledge, and known are dissolved in the Ocean of one eternal Consciousness; love, lover, and 










beloved merge in the unbounded Sea of supreme Felicity; birth, growth, and death vanish in 










infinite Existence. All doubts and misgivings are quelled for ever; the oscillations of the mind are 










stopped; the momentum of past actions is exhausted. Breaking down the ridge-pole of the 










tabernacle in which the soul has made its abode for untold ages, stilling the body, calming the 










mind, drowning the ego, the sweet joy of Brahman wells up in that superconscious state. Space 










disappears into nothingness, time is swallowed in eternity, and causation becomes a dream of the 










past. Only Existence is. Ah! Who can describe what the soul then feels in its communion with the 










Self? 



















Even when man descends from this dizzy height, he is devoid of ideas of "I" and "mine"; he 










looks on the body as a mere shadow, an outer sheath encasing the soul. He does not dwell on the 










past, takes no thought for the future, and looks with indifference on the present. He surveys 










everything in the world with an eye of equality; he is no longer touched by the infinite variety of 










phenomena; he no longer reacts to pleasure and pain. He remains unmoved whether he - that is to 










say, his body - is worshipped by the good or tormented by the wicked; for he realizes that it is the 










one Brahman that manifests Itself through everything. The impact of such an experience 










devastates the body and mind. Consciousness becomes blasted, as it were, with an excess of Light. 










In the Vedanta books it is said that after the experience of nirvikalpa Samadhi the body drops off 










like a dry leaf. Only those who are born with a special mission for the world can return from this 





































height to the valleys of normal life. They live and move in the world for the welfare of mankind. 










They are invested with a supreme spiritual power. A divine glory shines through them. 



















totApuri 



















Totapuri arrived at the Dakshineswar temple garden toward the end of 1864. Perhaps born 










in the Punjab, he was the head of a monastery in that province of India and claimed leadership of 










seven hundred sannyasis. Trained from early youth in the disciplines of the Advaita Vedanta, he 










looked upon the world as an illusion. The gods and goddesses of the dualistic worship were to him 










mere fantasies of the deluded mind. Prayers, ceremonies, rites, and rituals had nothing to do with 










true religion, and about these he was utterly indifferent. Exercising self-exertion and unshakable 










will-power, he had liberated himself from attachment to the sense-objects of the relative universe. 










For forty years he had practised austere discipline on the bank of the sacred Narmada and had 










finally realized his identity with the Absolute. Thenceforward he roamed in the world as an 










unfettered soul, a lion free from the cage. Clad in a loin-cloth, he spent his days under the canopy 










of the sky alike in storm and sunshine, feeding his body on the slender pittance of alms. He had 










been visiting the estuary of the Ganges. On his return journey along the bank of the sacred river, 










led by the inscrutable Divine Will, he stopped at Dakshineswar. 



















Totapuri, discovering at once that Sri Ramakrishna was prepared to be a student of 










Vedanta, asked to initiate him into its mysteries. With the permission of the Divine Mother, Sri 










Ramakrishna agreed to the proposal. But Totapuri explained that only a sannyasi could receive the 










teaching of Vedanta. Sri Ramakrishna agreed to renounce the world, but with the stipulation that 










the ceremony of his initiation into the monastic order be performed in secret, to spare the feelings 










of his old mother, who had been living with him at Dakshineswar. 



















On the appointed day, in the small hours of the morning, a fire was lighted in the 










Panchavati. Totapuri and Sri Ramakrishna sat before it. The flame played on their faces. 










"Ramakrishna was a small brown man with a short beard and beautiful eyes, long dark eyes, full of 










light, obliquely set and slightly veiled, never very wide open, but seeing half-closed a great 










distance both outwardly and inwardly. His mouth was open over his white teeth in a bewitching 










smile, at once affectionate and misch ievous. Of medium height, he was thin to emaciation and 










extremely delicate. His temperament was high-strung, for he was supersensitive to all the winds of 










joy and sorrow, both moral and physical. He was indeed a living reflection of all that happened 










before the mirror of his eyes, a two-sided mirror, turned both out and in." Facing him, the other 










rose like a rock. He was very tall and robust, a sturdy and tough oak. His constitution and mind 










were of iron. He was the strong leader of men. 



















In the burning flame before him Sri Ramakrishna performed the rituals of destroying his 










attachment to relatives, friends, body, mind, sense-organs, ego, and the world. The leaping 










flame swallowed it all, making the initiate free and pure. The sacred thread and the tuft of hair 










were consigned to the fire, completing his severance from caste, sex, and society. Last of all he 










burnt in that fire, with all that is holy as his witness, his desire for enjoyment here and hereafter. 










He uttered the sacred mantras giving assurance of safety and fearlessness to all beings, who were 





































only manifestations of his own Self. The rites completed, the disciple received from the guru the 










loincloth and ochre robe, the emblems of his new life. 



















The teacher and the disciple repaired to the meditation room near by. Totapuri began to 










impart to Sri Ramakrishna the great truths of Vedanta. "Brahman", he said, "is the only Reality, 










ever pure, ever illumined, ever free, beyond the limits of time, space, and causation. Though 










apparently divided by names and forms through the inscrutable power of Maya, that enchantress 










who makes the impossible possible, Brahman is really One and undivided. When a seeker merges 










in the beatitude of Samadhi, he does not perceive time and space or name and form, the offspring 










of Maya. Whatever is within the domain of Maya is unreal. Give it up. Destroy the prison-house of 










name and form and rush out of it with the strength of a lion. Dive deep in search of the Self and 










realize It through Samadhi. You will find the world of name and form vanishing into void, and the 










puny ego dissolving in Brahman-Consciousness. You will realize your identity with Brahman, 










Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute." Quoting the Upanishad, Totapuri said "That knowledge is 










shallow by which one sees or hears or knows another. What is shallow is worthless and can never 










give real felicity. But the Knowledge by which one does not see another or hear another or know 










another, which is beyond duality, is great, and through such Knowledge one attains the Infinite 










Bliss. How can the mind and senses grasp That which shines in the heart of all as the Eternal 










Subject?" 



















Totapuri asked the disciple to withdraw his mind from all objects of relative world, including 










the gods and goddesses, and to concentrate on the Absolute. But the task was not easy even for 










Sri Ramakrishna. He found it impossible to take his mind beyond Kali, the Divine Mother of the 










Universe. "After the initiation", Sri Ramakrishna once said, describing the event, "Nangta began to 










teach me the various conclusions of the Advaita Vedanta and asked me to withdraw the mind 










completely from all objects and dive deep into the Atman. But in spite of all my attempts I could 










not altogether cross the realm of name and form and bring my mind to the unconditioned state. I 










had no difficulty in taking the mind from all the objects of the world. But the radiant and too 










familiar figure of the Blissful Mother, the Embodiment of the essence of Pure Consciousness, 










appeared before me as a living reality. Her bewitching smile prevented me from passing into the 










Great Beyond. Again and again I tried, but She stood in my way every time. In despair I said to 










Nangta: 'It is hopeless. I cannot raise my mind to the unconditioned state and come face to face 










with Atman.' He grew excited and sharply said: 'What? You can't do it? But you have to.' He cast 










his eyes around. Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows. 










'Concentrate the mind on this point!' he thundered. Then with stern determination I again sat to 










meditate. As soon as the gracious form of the Divine Mother appeared before me, I used my 










discrimination as a sword and with it clove Her in two. The last barrier fell. My spirit at once soared 










beyond the relative plane and I lost myself in Samadhi." 



















Sri Ramakrishna remained completely absorbed in Samadhi for three days. "Is it really 










true?" Totapuri cried out in astonishment. "Is it possible that he has attained in a single day what it 










took me forty years of strenuous practice to achieve? Great God! It is nothing short of a miracle!" 










With the help of Totapuri, Sri Ramakrishna's mind finally came down to the relative Plane. 





































Totapuri, a monk of the most orthodox type, never stayed at a place more than three days. 










But he remained at Dakshineswar eleven months. He too had something to learn. 



















Totapuri had no idea of the struggles of ordinary men in the toils of passion and desire. 










Having maintained all through life the guilelessness of a child, he laughed at the idea of a man's 










being led astray by the senses. He was convinced that the world, was Maya and had only to be 










denounced to vanish for ever. A born non-dualist, he had no faith in a Personal God. He did not 










believe in the terrible aspect of Kali, much less in Her benign aspect. Music and the chanting of 










God's holy name were to him only so much nonsense. He ridiculed the spending of emotion on the 










worship of a Personal God. 



















KALI AND MAYA 



















Sri Ramakrishna, on the other hand, though fully aware, like his guru, that the world is an 










illusory appearance, instead of slighting Maya, like an orthodox monist, acknowledged its power in 










the relative life. He was all love and reverence for Maya, perceiving in it a mysterious and majestic 










expression of Divinity. To him Maya itself was God, for everything was God. It was one of the faces 










of Brahman. What he had realized on the heights of the transcendental plane, he also found here 










below, everywhere about him, under the mysterious garb of names and forms. And this garb was a 










perfectly transparent sheath, through which he recognized the glory of the Divine Immanence. 










Maya, the mighty weaver of the garb, is none other than Kali, the Divine Mother. She is the 










primordial Divine Energy, Sakti, and She can no more be distinguished from the Supreme Brahman 










than can the power of burning be distinguished from fire. She projects the world and again 










withdraws it. She spins it as the spider spins its web. She is the Mother of the Universe, identical 










with the Brahman of Vedanta, and with the Atman of Yoga. As eternal Lawgiver, She makes and 










unmakes laws; it is by Her imperious will that karma yields its fruit. She ensnares men with illusion 










and again releases them from bondage with a look of Her benign eyes. She is the supreme 










Mistress of the cosmic play, and all objects, animate and inanimate, dance by Her will. Even those 










who realize the Absolute in nirvikalpa Samadhi are under Her jurisdiction as long as they still live 










on the relative plane. 



















Thus, after Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Sri Ramakrishna realized Maya in an altogether new role. 










The binding aspect of Kali vanished from before his vision. She no longer obscured his 










understanding. The world became the glorious manifestation of the Divine Mother. Maya became 










Brahman. The Transcendental Itself broke through the Immanent. Sri Ramakrishna discovered that 










Maya operates in the relative world in two ways, and he termed these "Avidya-Maya" and 










"Vidya-Maya". Avidya-Maya represents the dark forces of creation: sensuous desires, evil 










passions, greed, lust, cruelty, and so on. It sustains the world system on the lower planes. It is 










responsible for the round of man's birth and death. It must be fought and vanquished. But 










Vidya-Maya is the higher force of creation: the spiritual virtues, the enlightening qualities, 










kindness, purity, love, devotion. Vidya-Maya elevates man to the higher planes of consciousness. 










With the help of Vidya- Maya the devotee rids himself of Avidya-Maya; he then becomes 










Mayatita, free of Maya. The two aspects of Maya are the two forces of creation, the two powers of 










Kali; and She stands beyond them both. She is like the effulgent sun, bringing into existence and 





































shining through and standing behind the clouds of different colours and shapes, conjuring up 










wonderful forms in the blue autumn heaven. 



















The Divine Mother asked Sri Ramakrishna not to be lost in the featureless Absolute but to 










remain in Bhava-mukha, on the threshold of relative consciousness, the border line between the 










Absolute and the Relative. He was to keep himself at the "sixth centre" of Tantra, from which he 










could see not only the glory of the seventh, but also the divine manifestations of the Kundalini in 










the lower centres. He gently oscillated back and forth across the dividing line. Ecstatic devotion to 










the Divine Mother alternated with serene absorption in the Ocean of Absolute Unity. He thus 










bridged the gulf between the Personal and the Impersonal, the immanent and the transcendent 










aspects of Reality. This is a unique experience in the recorded spiritual history of the world. 



















totApuris lesson 



















From Sri Ramakrishna Totapuri had to learn the significance of Kali, the Great Fact of the 










relative world, and of Maya, Her indescribable Power. 



















One day, when guru and disciple were engaged in an animated discussion about Vedanta, a 










servant of the temple garden came there and took a coal from the sacred fire that had been 










lighted by the great ascetic. He wanted it to light his tobacco. Totapuri flew into a rage and was 










about to beat the man. Sri Ramakrishna rocked with laughter. "What a shame!" he cried. "You are 










explaining to me the reality of Brahman and the illusoriness of the world; yet now you have so far 










forgotten yourself as to be about to beat a man in a fit of passion. The power of Maya is indeed 










inscrutable!" Totapuri was embarrassed. 



















About this time Totapuri was suddenly laid up with a severe attack of dysentery. On account 










of this miserable illness he found it impossible to meditate. One night the pain became 










excruciating. He could no longer concentrate on Brahman. The body stood in the way. He became 










incensed with its demands. A free soul, he did not at all care for the body. So he determined to 










drown it in the Ganges. Thereupon he walked into the river. But, lo! He walks to the other bank. Is 










there not enough water in the Ganges? Standing dumbfounded on the other bank he looks back 










across the water. The trees, the temples, the houses, are silhouetted against the sky. Suddenly, in 










one dazzling moment, he sees on all sides the presence of the Divine Mother. She is in everything; 










She is everything. She is in the water; She is on land. She is the body; She is the mind. She is pain; 










She is comfort. She is knowledge; She is ignorance. She is life; She is death. She is everything that 










one sees, hears, or imagines. She turns "yea" into "nay", and "nay" into "yea". Without Her grace 










no embodied being can go beyond Her realm. Man has no free will. He is not even free to die. Yet, 










again, beyond the body and mind She resides in Her Transcendental Absolute aspect. She is the 










Brahman that Totapuri had been worshipping all his life. 



















Totapuri returned to Dakshineswar and spent the remaining hours of the night meditating 










on the Divine Mother. In the morning he went to the Kali temple with Sri Ramakrishna and 










prostrated himself before the image of the Mother. He now realized why he had spent eleven 










months at Dakshineswar. Bidding farewell to the disciple, he continued on his way, enlightened. 





































Sri Ramakrishna later described the significance of Totapuri's lessons: "When I think of the 










Supreme Being as inactive - neither creating nor preserving nor destroying -, I call Him Brahman or 










Purusha, the Impersonal God. When I think of Him as active - creating, preserving, and destroying 










-, I call Him Sakti or Maya or Prakriti, the Personal God. But the distinction between them does not 










mean a difference. The Personal and the Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its 










whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to 










conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one." 



















After the departure of Totapuri, Sri Ramakrishna remained for six months in a state of 










absolute identity with Brahman. "For six months at a stretch", he said, "I remained in that state 










from which ordinary men can never return; generally the body falls off, after three weeks, like a 










sere leaf. I was not conscious of day and night. Flies would enter my mouth and nostrils just as 










they do a dead body's, but I did not feel them. My hair became matted with dust." 



















His body would not have survived but for the kindly attention of a monk who happened to 










be at Dakshineswar at that time and who somehow realized that for the good of humanity Sri 










Ramakrishna's body must be preserved. He tried various means, even physical violence, to recall 










the fleeing soul to the prison-house of the body, and during the resultant fleeting moments of 










consciousness he would push a few morsels of food down Sri Ramakrishna's throat. Presently Sri 










Ramakrishna received the command of the Divine Mother to remain on the threshold of relative 










consciousness. Soon thereafter he was afflicted with a serious attack of dysentery. Day and night 










the pain tortured him, and his mind gradually came down to the physical plane. 



















COMPANY OF HOLY MEN AND DEVOTEES 



















From now on Sri Ramakrishna began to seek the company of devotees and holy men. He 










had gone through the storm and stress of spiritual disciplines and visions. Now he realized an inner 










calmness and appeared to others as a normal person. But he could not bear the company of 










worldly people or listen to their talk. Fortunately the holy atmosphere of Dakshineswar and the 










liberality of Mathur attracted monks and holy men from all parts of the country. Sadhus of all 










denominations - monists and dualists, Vaishnavas and Vedantists, Saktas and worshippers of Rama 










- flocked there in ever increasing numbers. Ascetics and visionaries came to seek Sri Ramakrishna's 










advice. Vaishnavas had come during the period of his Vaishnava sadhana, and Tantriks when he 










practised the disciplines of Tantra. Vedantists began to arrive after the departure of Totapuri. In 










the room of Sri Ramakrishna, who was then in bed with dysentery, the Vedantists engaged in 










scriptural discussions, and, forgetting his own physical suffering, he solved their doubts by 










referring directly to his own experiences. Many of the visitors were genuine spiritual souls, the 










unseen pillars of Hinduism, and their spiritual lives were quickened in no small measure by the 










sage of Dakshineswar. Sri Ramakrishna in turn learnt from them anecdotes concerning the ways 










and the conduct of holy men, which he subsequently narrated to his devotees and disciples. At his 










request Mathur provided him with large stores of foodstuffs, clothes, and so forth, for distribution 










among the wandering monks. 



















Sri Ramakrishna had not read books, yet he possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of 










religions and religious philosophies. This he acquired from his contacts with innumerable holy men 





































and scholars. He had a unique power of assimilation; through meditation he made this knowledge 










a part of his being. Once, when he was asked by a disciple about the source of his seemingly 










inexhaustible knowledge, he replied: "I have not read; but I have heard the learned. I have made a 










garland of their knowledge, wearing it round my neck, and I have given it as an offering at the feet 










of the Mother." 



















Sri Ramakrishna used to say that when the flower blooms the bees come to it for honey of 










their own accord. Now many souls began to visit Dakshineswar to satisfy their spiritual hunger. He, 










the devotee and aspirant, became the Master. Gauri, the great scholar who had been one of the 










first to proclaim Sri Ramakrishna an Incarnation of God, paid the Master a visit in 1870 and with 










the Master's blessings renounced the world. Narayan Sastri, another great pundit, who had 










mastered the six systems of Hindu philosophy and had been offered a lucrative post by the 










Maharaja of Jaipur, met the Master and recognized in him one who had realized in life those ideals 










which he himself had encountered merely in books. Sri Ramakrishna initiated Narayan Sastri, at his 










earnest request, into the life of sannyas. Pundit Padmalochan, the court pundit of the Maharaja of 










Burdwan, well known for his scholarship in both the Vedanta and the Nyaya systems of 










philosophy, accepted the Master as an Incarnation of God. Krishnakishore, a Vedantist scholar, 










became devoted to the Master. And there arrived Viswanath Upadhyaya, who was to become a 










favourite devotee; Sri Ramakrishna always addressed 



















him as "Captain". He was a high officer of the King of Nepal and had received the title of 










Colonel in recognition of his merit. A scholar of the Gita, the Bhagavata, and the Vedanta 










philosophy, he daily performed the worship of his Chosen Deity with great devotion. "I have read 










the Vedas and the other scriptures", he said. "I have also met a good many monks and devotees in 










different places. But it is in Sri Ramakrishna's presence that my spiritual yearnings have been 










fulfilled. To me he seems to be the embodiment of the truths of the scriptures." 



















The Knowledge of Brahman in nirvikalpa Samadhi had convinced Sri Ramakrishna that the 










gods of the different religions are but so many readings of the Absolute, and that the Ultimate 










Reality could never be expressed by human tongue. He understood that all religions lead their 










devotees by differing paths to one and the same goal. Now he became eager to explore some of 










the alien religions; for with him understanding meant actual experience. 



















ISLAM 



















Toward the end of 1866 he began to practise the disciplines of Islam. Under the direction of 










his Mussalman guru he abandoned himself to his new sadhana. He dressed as a Mussalman and 










repeated the name of Allah. 



















His prayers took the form of the Islamic devotions. He forgot the Hindu gods and goddesses 










- even Kali - and gave up visiting the temples. He took up his residence outside the temple 










precincts. After three days he saw the vision of a radiant figure, perhaps Mohammed. This figure 










gently approached him and finally lost himself in Sri Ramakrishna. Thus he realized the Mussalman 










God. Thence he passed into communion with Brahman. The mighty river of Islam also led him back 










to the Ocean of the Absolute. 





































CHRISTIANITY 



















Eight years later, some time in November 1874, Sri Ramakrishna was seized with an 










irresistible desire to learn the truth of the Christian religion. He began to listen to readings from 










the Bible, by Sambhu Charan Mallick, a gentleman of Calcutta and a devotee of the Master. Sri 










Ramakrishna became fascinated by the life and teachings of Jesus. One day he was seated in the 










parlour of Jadu Mallick's garden house at Dakshineswar, when his eyes became fixed on a painting 










of the Madonna and Child. Intently watching it, he became gradually overwhelmed with divine 










emotion. The figures in the picture took on life, and the rays of light emanating from them entered 










his soul. The effect of this experience was stronger than that of the vision of Mohammed. In 










dismay he cried out, "0 Mother! What are You doing to me?" And, breaking through the barriers 










of creed and religion, he entered a new realm of ecstasy. Christ possessed his soul. For three days 










he did not set foot in the Kali temple. On the fourth day, in the afternoon, as he was walking in the 










Panchavati, he saw coming toward him a person with beautiful large eyes, serene countenance, 










and fair skin. As the two faced each other, a voice rang out in the depths of Sri Ramakrishna's soul: 










"Behold the Christ who shed His heart's blood for the redemption of the world, who suffered a sea 










of anguish for love of men. It is He, the Master Yogi, who is in eternal union with God. It is Jesus, 










Love Incarnate." The Son of Man embraced the Son of the Divine Mother and merged in him. 



















Sri Ramakrishna realized his identity with Christ, as he had already realized his identity with 










Kali, Rama, Hanuman, Radha, Krishna, Brahman, and Mohammed. The Master went into Samadhi 










and communed with the Brahman with attributes. Thus he experienced the truth that Christianity, 










too, was a path leading to God-Consciousness. Till the last moment of his life he believed that 










Christ was an Incarnation of God. But Christ, for him, was not the only Incarnation; there were 










others - Buddha, for instance, and Krishna. 



















ATTITUDE TOWARD DIFFERENT RELIGIONS 



















Sri Ramakrishna accepted the divinity of Buddha and used to point out the similarity of his 










teachings to those of the Upanishads. He also showed great respect for the Tirthankaras, who 










founded Jainism, and for the ten Gurus of Sikhism. But he did not speak of them as Divine 










Incarnations. He was heard to say that the Gurus of Sikhism were the reincarnations of King Janaka 










of ancient India. He kept in his room at Dakshineswar a small statue of Tirthankara Mahavira and a 










picture of Christ, before which incense was burnt morning and evening. 



















Without being formally initiated into their doctrines, Sri Ramakrishna thus realized the 










ideals of religions other than Hinduism. He did not need to follow any doctrine. All barriers were 










removed by his overwhelming love of God. So he became a Master who could speak with authority 










regarding the ideas and ideals of the various religions of the world. "I have practised", said he, "all 










religions - Hinduism, Islam, Christianity - and I have also followed the paths of the different Hindu 










sects. I have found that it is the same God toward whom all are directing their steps, though along 










different paths. You must try all beliefs and traverse all the different ways once. Wherever I look, I 










see men quarrelling in the name of religion - Hindus, Mohammedans, Brahmos, Vaishnavas, and 










the rest. But they never reflect that He who is called Krishna is also called Siva, and bears the name 










of the Primal Energy, Jesus, and Allah as well - the same Rama with a thousand names. A lake has 










several Ghats. At one, the Hindus take water in pitchers and call it 'Jal'; at another the Mussalmans 





































take water in leather bags and call it 'pani'. At a third the Christians call it 'water'. Can we imagine 










that it is not 'jal', but only 'pani' or 'water'? How ridiculous! The substance is One under different 










names, and everyone is seeking the same substance; only climate, temperament, and name create 










differences. Let each man follow his own path. If he sincerely and ardently wishes to know God, 










peace be unto him! He will surely realize Him." 



















In 1867, Sri Ramakrishna returned to Kamarpukur to recuperate from the effect of his 










austerities. The peaceful countryside, the simple and artless companions of his boyhood, and the 










pure air did him much good. The villagers were happy to get back their playful, frank, witty, 










kind-hearted, and truthful Gadadhar, though they did not fail to notice the great change that had 










come over him during his years in Calcutta. His wife, Sarada Devi, now fourteen years old, soon 










arrived at Kamarpukur. Her spiritual development was much beyond her age and she was able to 










understand immediately her husband's state of mind. She became eager to learn from him about 










God and to live with him as his attendant. The Master accepted her cheerfully both as his disciple 










and as his spiritual companion. Referring to the experiences of these few days, she once said: "I 










used to feel always as if a pitcher full of bliss were placed in my heart. The joy was indescribable." 



















PILGRIMAGE 



















On January 27, 1868, Mathur Babu with a party of some one hundred and twenty-five 










persons set out on a pilgrimage to the sacred places of northern India. At Vaidyanath in Behar, 










when the Master saw the inhabitants of a village reduced by poverty and starvation to mere 










skeletons, he requested his rich patron to feed the people and give each a piece of cloth. Mathur 










demurred at the added expense. The Master declared bitterly that he would not go on to Banaras, 










but would live with the poor and share their miseries. He actually left Mathur and sat down with 










the villagers. 



















Whereupon Mathur had to yield. On another occasion, two years later, Sri Ramakrishna 










showed a similar sentiment for the poor and needy. He accompanied Mathur on a tour to one of 










the latter's estates at the time of the collection of rents. For two years the harvests had failed and 










the tenants were in a state of extreme poverty. The Master asked Mathur to remit their rents, 










distribute help to them, and in addition give the hungry people a sumptuous feast. When Mathur 










grumbled, the Master said: "You are only the steward of the Divine Mother. They are the Mother's 










tenants. You must spend the Mother's money. When they are suffering, how can you refuse to 










help them? You must help them." Again Mathur had to give in. Sri Ramakrishna's sympathy for the 










poor sprang from his perception of God in all created beings. His sentiment was not that of the 










humanist or philanthropist. To him the service of man was the same as the worship of God. 



















The party entered holy Banaras by boat along the Ganges. When Sri Ramakrishna's eyes fell 










on this city of Siva, where had accumulated for ages the devotion and piety of countless 










worshippers, he saw it to be made of gold, as the scriptures declare. He was visibly moved. During 










his stay in the city he treated every particle of its earth with utmost respect. At the Manikarnika 










Ghat, the great cremation ground of the city, he actually saw Siva, with ash-covered body and 










tawny matted hair, serenely approaching each funeral pyre and breathing into the ears of the 










corpses the mantra of liberation; and then the Divine Mother removing from the dead their bonds. 





































Thus he realized the significance of the scriptural statement that anyone dying in Banaras attains 










salvation through the grace of Siva. He paid a visit to Trailanga Swami, the celebrated monk, whom 










he later declared to be a real paramahamsa, a veritable image of Siva. 



















Sri Ramakrishna visited Allahabad, at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jamuna, and 










then proceeded to Vrindavan and Mathura, hallowed by the legends, songs, and dramas about 










Krishna and the gopis. Here he had numerous visions and his heart overflowed with divine 










emotion. He wept and said: "0 Krishna! Everything here is as it was in the olden days. You alone 










are absent." He visited the great woman saint Gangamayi, regarded by Vaishnava devotees as the 










reincarnation of an intimate attendant of Radha. She was sixty years old and had frequent trances. 










She spoke of Sri Ramakrishna as an incarnation of Radha. With great difficulty he was persuaded to 










leave her. 



















On the return journey Mathur wanted to visit Gaya, but Sri Ramakrishna declined to go. He 










recalled his father's vision at Gaya before his own birth and felt that in the temple of Vishnu he 










would become permanently absorbed in God. Mathur, honouring the Master's wish, returned with 










his party to Calcutta. 



















From Vrindavan the Master had brought a handful of dust. Part of this he scattered in the 










Panchavati; the rest he buried in the little hut where he had practised meditation. "Now this 










place", he said, "is as sacred as Vrindavan." 



















In 1870 the Master went on a pilgrimage to Nadia, the birth-place of Sri Chaitanya. As the 










boat by which he travelled approached the sand-bank close to Nadia, Sri Ramakrishna had a vision 










of the "two brothers", Sri Chaitanya and his companion Nityananda, "bright as molten gold" and 










with haloes, rushing to greet him with uplifted hands. "There they come! There they come!" he 










cried. They entered his body and he went into a deep trance. 



















RELATION WITH HIS WIFE 



















In 1872, Sarada Devi paid her first visit to her husband at Dakshineswar. Four years earlier 










she had seen him at Kamarpukur and had tasted the bliss of his divine company. Since then she 










had become even more gentle, tender, introspective, serious, and unselfish. She had heard many 










rumours about her husband's insanity. People had shown her pity in her misfortune. The more she 










thought, the more she felt that her duty was to be with him, giving him, in whatever measure she 










could, a wife's devoted service. She was now eighteen years old. Accompanied by her father, she 










arrived at Dakshineswar, having come on foot the distance of eighty miles. She had had an attack 










of fever on the way. When she arrived at the temple garden the Master said sorrowfully: "Ah! You 










have come too late. My Mathur is no longer here to look after you." Mathur had passed away the 










previous year. 



















The Master took up the duty of instructing his young wife, and this included everything 










from housekeeping to the Knowledge of Brahman. He taught her how to trim a lamp, how to 










behave toward people according to their differing temperaments, and how to conduct herself 










before visitors. He instructed her in the mysteries of spiritual life prayer, meditation, japa, deep 










contemplation, and Samadhi. The first lesson that Sarada Devi received was: "God is everybody's 





































Beloved, just as the moon is dear to every child. Everyone has the same right to pray to Him. Out 










of His grace He reveals Himself to all who call upon Him. You too will see Him if you but pray to 










Him." 



















Totapuri, coming to know of the Master's marriage, had once remarked: "What does it 










matter? He alone is firmly established in the Knowledge of Brahman who can adhere to his spirit of 










discrimination and renunciation even while living with his wife. He alone has attained the supreme 










illumination who can look on man and woman alike as Brahman. A man with the idea of sex may 










be a good aspirant, but he is still far from the goal." Sri Ramakrishna and his wife lived together at 










Dakshineswar, but their minds always soared above the worldly plane. A few months after Sarada 










Devi's arrival Sri Ramakrishna arranged, on an auspicious day, a special worship of Kali, the Divine 










Mother. Instead of an image of the Deity, he placed on the seat the living image, Sarada Devi 










herself. The worshipper and the worshipped went into deep Samadhi and in the transcendental 










plane their souls were united. After several hours Sri Ramakrishna came down again to the relative 










plane, sang a hymn to the Great Goddess, and surrendered, at the feet of the living image, himself, 










his rosary, and the fruit of his life-long sadhana. This is known in Tantra as the Shodasi Puja, the 










"Adoration of Woman". Sri Ramakrishna realized the significance of the great statement of the 










Upanishad: "0 Lord, Thou art the woman, Thou art the man; Thou art the boy, Thou art the girl; 










Thou art the old, tottering on their crutches. Thou pervadest the universe in its multiple forms." 



















By his marriage Sri Ramakrishna admitted the great value of marriage in man's spiritual 










evolution, and by adhering to his monastic vows he demonstrated the imperative necessity of 










self-control, purity, and continence, in the realization of God. By his unique spiritual relationship 










with his wife he proved that husband and wife can live together as spiritual companions. Thus his 










life is a synthesis of the ways of life of the householder and the monk. 



















THE "EGO" OF THE MASTER 



















In the nirvikalpa Samadhi Sri Ramakrishna had realized that Brahman alone is real and the 










world illusory. By keeping his mind six months on the plane of the non-dual Brahman, he had 










attained to the state of the Vijnani, the Knower of Truth in a special and very rich sense, who sees 










Brahman not only in himself and in the transcendental Absolute, but in everything of the world. In 










this state of Vijnana, sometimes, bereft of body-consciousness, he would regard himself as one 










with Brahman; sometimes, conscious of the dual world, he would regard himself as God's devotee, 










servant, or child. In order to enable the Master to work for the welfare of humanity, the Divine 










Mother had kept in him a trace of ego, which he described - according to his mood - as the "ego of 










Knowledge", the "ego of Devotion", the "ego of a child", or the "ego of a servant". In any case this 










ego of the Master, consumed by the fire of the Knowledge of Brahman, was an appearance only, 










like a burnt string. He often referred to this ego as the "ripe ego" in contrast with the ego of the 










bound soul, which he described as the "unripe" or "green" ego. The ego of the bound soul 










identifies itself with the body, relatives, possessions, and the world; but the "ripe ego", illumined 










by Divine Knowledge, knows the body, relatives, possessions, and the world to be unreal and 










establishes a relationship of love with God alone. Through this "ripe ego" Sri Ramakrishna dealt 










with the world and his wife. One day, while stroking his feet, Sarada Devi asked the Master, "What 










do you think of me?" Quick came the answer: "The Mother who is worshipped in the temple is the 





































mother who has given birth to my body and is now living in the Nahabat, and it is She again who is 










stroking my feet at this moment. Indeed, I always look on you as the personification of the Blissful 










Mother Kali." 



















Sarada Devi, in the company of her husband, had rare spiritual experiences. She said: "I 










have no words to describe my wonderful exaltation of spirit as I watched him in his different 










moods. Under the influence of divine emotion he would sometimes talk on abstruse subjects, 










sometimes laugh, sometimes weep, and sometimes become perfectly motionless in Samadhi. This 










would continue throughout the night. There was such an extraordinary divine presence in him that 










now and then I would shake with fear and wonder how the night would pass. Months went by in 










this way. Then one day he discovered that I had to keep awake the whole night lest, during my 










sleep, he should go into Samadhi - for it might happen at any moment -, and so he asked me to 










sleep in the Nahabat." 



















SUMMARY OF THE MASTER'S SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES 



















We have now come to the end of Sri Ramakrishna's sadhana, the period of his spiritual 










discipline. As a result of his supersensuous experiences he reached certain conclusions regarding 










himself and spirituality in general. His conclusions about himself may be summarised as follows: 



















First, he was an Incarnation of God, a specially commissioned person, whose spiritual 










experiences were for the benefit of humanity. Whereas it takes an ordinary man a whole life's 










struggle to realize one or two phases of God, he had in a few years realized God in all His phases. 



















Second, he knew that he had always been a free soul, that the various disciplines through 










which he had passed were really not necessary for his own liberation but were solely for the 










benefit of others. Thus the terms liberation and bondage were not applicable to him. As long as 










there are beings who consider themselves bound, God must come down to earth as an Incarnation 










to free them from bondage, just as a magistrate must visit any part of his district in which there is 










trouble. 



















Third, he came to foresee the time of his death. His words with respect to this matter were 










literally fulfilled. 



















ABOUT SPIRITUALITY IN GENERAL THE FOLLOWING WERE HIS CONCLUSIONS : 



















First, he was firmly convinced that all religions are true, that every doctrinal system 










represents a path to God. He had followed all the main paths and all had led him to the same goal. 










He was the first religious prophet recorded in history to preach the harmony of religions. 



















Second, the three great systems of thought known as Dualism, Qualified Non-dualism, and 










Absolute Non-dualism - Dvaita, Visishtadvaita, and Advaita - he perceived to represent three 










stages in man's progress toward the Ultimate Reality. They were not contradictory but 










complementary and suited to different temperaments. For the ordinary man with strong 










attachment to the senses, a dualistic form of religion, prescribing a certain amount of material 










support, such as music and other symbols, is useful. A man of God-realization transcends the idea 










of worldly duties, but the ordinary mortal must perform his duties, striving to be unattached and 





































to surrender the results to God. The mind can comprehend and describe the range of thought and 










experience up to the Visistadvaita, and no further. The Advaita, the last word in spiritual 










experience, is something to be felt in Samadhi, for it transcends mind and speech. From the 










highest standpoint, the Absolute and Its manifestation are equally real - the Lord's Name, His 










Abode, and the Lord Himself are of the same spiritual Essence. Everything is Spirit, the difference 










being only in form. 



















Third, Sri Ramakrishna realized the wish of the Divine Mother that through him She should 










found a new Order, consisting of those who would uphold the universal doctrines illustrated in his 










life. 



















Fourth, his spiritual insight told him that those who were having their last birth on the 










mortal plane of existence and those who had sincerely called on the Lord even once in their lives 










must come to him. 



















During this period Sri Ramakrishna suffered several bereavements. The first was the death 










of a nephew named, Akshay. After the young man's death Sri Ramakrishna said: "Akshay died 










before my very eyes. But it did not affect me in the least. I stood by and watched a man die. It was 










like a sword being drawn from its scabbard. I enjoyed the scene, and laughed and sang and danced 










over it. They removed the body and cremated it. But the next day as I stood there (pointing to the 










southeast verandah of his room), I felt a racking pain for the loss of Akshay, as if somebody were 










squeezing my heart like a wet towel. I wondered at it and thought that the Mother was teaching 










me a lesson. I was not much concerned even with my own body - much less with a relative. But if 










such was my pain at the loss of a nephew, how much more must be the grief of the householders 










at the loss of their near and dear ones!" In 1871 Mathur died, and some five years later Sambhu 










Mallick - who, after Mathur's passing away, had taken care of the Master's comfort. In 1873 died 










his elder brother Rameswar, and in 1876, his beloved mother. These bereavements left their 










imprint on the tender human heart of Sri Ramakrishna albeit he had realized the immortality of 










the soul and the illusoriness of birth and death. 



















In March 1875, about a year before the death of his mother, the Master met Keshab 










Chandra Sen. The meeting was a momentous event for both Sri Ramakrishna and Keshab. Here the 










Master for the first time came into actual contact with a worthy representative of modern India. 



















BRAHMO SAMAj 



















Keshab was the leader of the Brahmo Samaj, one of the two great movements that, during 










the latter part of the nineteenth century, played an important part in shaping the course of the 










renascence of India. The founder of the Brahmo movement had been the great Raja Rammohan 










Roy (1774-1833). Though born in an orthodox brahmin family, Rammohan Roy had shown great 










sympathy for Islam and Christianity. He had gone to Tibet in search of the Buddhist mysteries. 










He had extracted from Christianity its ethical system, but had rejected the divinity of Christ as he 










had denied the Hindu Incarnations. The religion of Islam influenced him, to a great extent, in the 










formulation of his monotheistic doctrines. But he always went back to the Vedas for his spiritual 










inspiration. The Brahmo Samaj, which he founded in 1828, was dedicated to the "worship and 










adoration of the Eternal, the Unsearchable, the Immutable Being, who is the Author and Preserver 





































of the Universe". The Samaj was open to all without distinction of colour, creed, caste, nation, or 










religion. 



















The real organizer of the Samaj was Devendranath Tagore (1817-1905), the father of the 










poet Rabindranath. His physical and spiritual beauty, aristocratic aloofness, penetrating intellect, 










and poetic sensibility made him the foremost leader of the educated Bengalis. These addressed 










him by the respectful epithet of Maharshi, the "Great Seer". The Maharshi was a Sanskrit scholar 










and, unlike Raja Rammohan Roy, drew his inspiration entirely from the Upanishads. He was an 










implacable enemy of image worship and also fought to stop the infiltration of Christian ideas into 










the Samaj. He gave the movement its faith and ritual. Under his influence the Brahmo Samaj 










professed One Self-existent Supreme Being who had created the universe out of nothing, the God 










of Truth, Infinite Wisdom, Goodness, and Power, the Eternal and Omnipotent, the One without a 










Second. Man should love Him and do His will, believe in Him and worship Him, and thus merit 










salvation in the world to come. 



















By far the ablest leader of the Brahmo movement was Keshab Chandra Sen (18381884). 










Unlike Raja Rammohan Roy and Devendranath Tagore, Keshab was born of a middle-class Bengali 










family and had been brought up in an English school. He did not know Sanskrit and very soon 










broke away from the popular Hindu religion. Even at an early age he came under the spell of Christ 










and professed to have experienced the special favour of John the Baptist, Christ, and St. Paul. 










When he strove to introduce Christ to the Brahmo Samaj, a rupture became inevitable with 










Devendranath. In 1868 Keshab broke with the older leader and founded the Brahmo Samaj of 










India, Devendra retaining leadership of the first Brahmo Samaj, now called the Adi Samaj. 



















Keshab possessed a complex nature. When passing through a great moral crisis, he spent 










much of his time in solitude and felt that he heard the voice of God. When a devotional form of 










worship was introduced into the Brahmo Samaj, he spent hours in singing kirtan with his followers. 










He visited England in 1870 and impressed the English people with his musical voice, his simple 










English, and his spiritual fervour. He was entertained by Queen Victoria. Returning to India, he 










founded centres of the Brahmo Samaj in various parts of the country. Not unlike a professor of 










comparative religion in a European university, he began to discover, about the time of his first 










contact with Sri Ramakrishna, the harmony of religions. He became sympathetic toward the Hindu 










gods and goddesses, explaining them in a liberal fashion. Further, he believed that he was called 










by God to dictate to the world God's newly revealed law, the New Dispensation, the Nava-vidhan. 



















In 1878 a schism divided Keshab's Samaj. Some of his influential followers accused him of 










infringing the Brahmo principles by marrying his daughter to a wealthy man before she had 










attained the marriageable age approved by the Samaj. This group seceded and established the 










Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, Keshab remaining the leader of the Navavidhan. Keshab now began to be 










drawn more and more toward the Christ ideal, though under the influence of Sri Ramakrishna his 










devotion to the Divine Mother also deepened. His mental oscillation between Christ and the Divine 










Mother of Hinduism found no position of rest. In Bengal and some other parts of India the Brahmo 










movement took the form of Unitarian Christianity, scoffed at Hindu rituals, and preached a 










crusade against image worship. Influenced by Western culture, it declared the supremacy of 










reason, advocated the ideals of the French Revolution, abolished the caste-system among, its own 





































members, stood for the emancipation of women, agitate for the abolition of early marriage, 










sanctioned the remarriage of widows, and encouraged various educational and social-reform 










movements. The immediate effect of the Brahmo movement in Bengal was the checking of the 










proselytising activities of the Christian missionaries. It also raised Indian culture in the estimation 










of its English masters. But it was an intellectual and eclectic religious ferment born of the necessity 










of the time. Unlike Hinduism, it was not founded on the deep inner experiences of sages and 










prophets. Its influence was confined to a comparatively few educated men and women of the 










country, and the vast masses of the Hindus remained outside it. It sounded monotonously only 










one of the notes in the rich gamut of the Eternal Religion of the Hindus. 



















Arya samAj 



















The other movement playing an important part in the nineteenth-century religious revival 










of India was the Arya Samaj. The Brahmo Samaj, essentially a movement of compromise with 










European culture, tacitly admitted the superiority of the West. But the founder of the Arya Samaj 










was a pugnacious Hindu sannyasi who accepted the challenge of Islam and Christianity and was 










resolved to combat all foreign influence in India. Swami Dayananda (1824-1883) launched this 










movement in Bombay in 1875, and soon its influence was felt throughout western India. The 










Swami was a great scholar of the Vedas, which he explained as being strictly mono-theistic. He 










preached against the worship of images and re-established the ancient Vedic sacrificial rites. 










According to him the Vedas were the ultimate authority on religion, and he accepted every word 










of them as literally true. The Arya Samaj became a bulwark against the encroachments of Islam 










and Christianity, and its orthodox flavour appealed to many Hindu minds. It also assumed 










leadership in many movements of social reform. The caste-system became a target of its attack. 










Women it liberated from many of their social disabilities. The cause of education received from it a 










great impetus. It started agitation against early marriage and advocated the remarriage of Hindu 










widows. Its influence was strongest in the Punjab, the battle-ground of the Hindu and Islamic 










cultures. A new fighting attitude was introduced into the slumbering Hindu society. Unlike the 










Brahmo Samaj, the influence of the Arya Samaj was not confined to the intellectuals. It was a force 










that spread to the masses. It was a dogmatic movement intolerant of those disagreed with its 










views, and it emphasized only one way, the Arya Samaj way, to the realization of Truth. Sri 










Ramakrishna met Swami Dayananda when the latter visited Bengal. 



















KESHAB CHANDRA SEN 



















Keshab Chandra Sen and Sri Ramakrishna met for the first time in the garden house of 










Jaygopal Sen at Belgharia, a few miles from Dakshineswar, where the great Brahmo leader was 










staying with some of his disciples. In many respects the two were poles apart, though an 










irresistible inner attraction was to make them intimate friends. The Master had realized God as 










Pure Spirit and Consciousness, but he believed in the various forms of God as well. Keshab, on the 










other hand, regarded image worship as idolatry and gave allegorical explanations of the Hindu 










deities. Keshab was an orator and a writer of books and magazine articles; Sri Ramakrishna had a 










horror of lecturing and hardly knew how to write his own name. Keshab's fame spread far and 










wide, even reaching the distant shores of England; the Master still led a secluded life in the village 










of Dakshineswar. Keshab emphasized social reforms for India's regeneration; to Sri Ramakrishna 





































God-realization was the only goal of life. Keshab considered himself a disciple of Christ and 










accepted in a diluted form the Christian sacraments and Trinity; Sri Ramakrishna was the simple 










child of Kali, the Divine Mother, though he too, in a different way, acknowledged Christ's divinity. 










Keshab was a house-holder and took a real interest in the welfare of his children, whereas Sri 










Ramakrishna was a paramahamsa and completely indifferent to the life of the world. Yet, as their 










acquaintance ripened into friendship, Sri Ramakrishna and Keshab held each other in great love 










and respect. Years later, at the news of Keshab's death, the Master felt as if half his body had 










become paralysed. Keshab's concepts of the harmony of religions and the Motherhood of God 










were deepened and enriched by his contact with Sri Ramakrishna. 



















Sri Ramakrishna, dressed in a red-bordered dhoti, one end of which was carelessly thrown 










over his left shoulder, came to Jaygopal's garden house accompanied by Hriday. No one took 










notice of the unostentatious visitor. Finally the Master said to Keshab, "People tell me you have 










seen God; so I have come to hear from you about God." A magnificent conversation followed. The 










Master sang a thrilling song about Kali and forthwith went into Samadhi. When Hriday uttered the 










sacred "Om" in his ears, he gradually came back to consciousness of the world, his face still 










radiating a divine brilliance. Keshab and his followers were amazed. The contrast between Sri 










Ramakrishna and the Brahmo devotees was very interesting. There sat this small man, thin and 










extremely delicate. His eyes were illumined with an inner light. Good humour gleamed in his eyes 










and lurked in the corners of his mouth. His speech was Bengali of a homely kind with a slight, 










delightful stammer, and his words held men enthralled by their wealth of spiritual experience, 










their inexhaustible store of simile and metaphor, their power of observation, their bright and 










subtle humour, their wonderful catholicity, their ceaseless flow of wisdom. And around him now 










were the sophisticated men of Bengal, the best products of Western education, with Keshab, the 










idol of young Bengal, as their leader. 



















Keshab's sincerity was enough for Sri Ramakrishna. Henceforth the two saw each other 










frequently, either at Dakshineswar or at the temple of the Brahmo Samaj. Whenever the Master 










was in the temple at the time of divine service, Keshab would request him to speak to the 










congregation. And Keshab would visit the saint, in his turn, with offerings of flowers and fruits. 



















OTHER BRAHMO LEADERS 



















Gradually other Brahmo leaders began to feel Sri Ramakrishna's influence. But they were by 










no means uncritical admirers of the Master. They particularly disapproved of his ascetic 










renunciation and condemnation of, "woman and gold". 7 They measured him according to their 










own ideals of the householder's life. Some could not understand his Samadhi and described it as a 










nervous malady. Yet they could not resist his magnetic personality. 



















Among the Brahmo leaders who knew the Master closely were Pratap Chandra Mazumdar, 










Vijay Krishna Goswami, Trailokyanath Sannyal and Sivanath Sastri. 



















Sivanath, one day, was greatly impressed by the Master's utter simplicity and abhorrence of 










praise. He was seated with Sri Ramakrishna in the latter's room when several rich men of Calcutta 










arrived. The Master left the room for a few minutes. In the mean time Hriday, his nephew, began 










to describe his Samadhi to the visitors. The last few words caught the Master's ear as he entered 





































the room. He said to Hriday: "What a mean-spirited fellow you must be to extol me thus before 










these rich men! You have seen their costly apparel and their gold watches and chains, and your 










object is to get from them as much money as you can. What do I care about what they think of 










me? (Turning to the gentlemen) No, my friends, what he has told you about me is not true. It was 










not love of God that made me absorbed in God and indifferent to external life. I became positively 










insane for some time. The sadhus who frequented this temple told me to practise many things. I 










tried to follow them, and the consequence was that my austerities drove me to insanity." This is a 










quotation from one of Sivanath's books. He took the Master's words literally and failed to see their 










real import. 



















Sivanath vehemently criticized the Master for his other-worldly attitude toward his wife. He 










writes: "Ramakrishna was practically separated from his wife, who lived in her village home. One 










day when I was complaining to some friends about the virtual widowhood of his wife, he drew me 










to one side and whispered in my ear: 'Why do you complain? It is no longer possible; it is all dead 










and gone.' Another day as I was inveighing against this part of his teaching, and also declaring that 










our program of work in the Brahmo Samaj includes women, that ours is a social and domestic 










religion, and that we want to give education and social liberty to women, the saint became very 










much excited, as was his way when anything against his settled conviction was asserted - a trait we 










so much liked in him - and exclaimed, 'Go, thou fool, go and perish in the pit that your women will 










dig for you.' Then he glared at me and said: 'What does a gardener do with a young plant? Does he 










not surround it with a fence, to protect it from goats and cattle? And when the young plant has 










grown up into a tree and it can no longer be injured by cattle, does he not remove the fence and 










let the tree grow freely?' I replied, 'Yes, that is the custom with gardeners.' Then he remarked, 










'Do the same in your spiritual life; become strong, be full-grown; then you may seek them.' To 










which I replied, 'I don't agree with you in thinking that women's work is like that of cattle, 










destructive; they are our associates and helpers in our spiritual struggles and social progress' - a 










view with which he could not agree, and he marked his dissent by shaking his head. Then referring 










to the lateness of the hour he jocularly remarked, 'It is time for you to depart; take care, do not be 










late; otherwise your woman will not admit you into her room.' This evoked hearty laughter." 



















Pratap Chandra Mazumdar, the right-hand man of Keshab and an accomplished Brahmo 










preacher in Europe and America, bitterly criticized Sri Ramakrishna's use of uncultured language 










and also his austere attitude toward his wife. But he could not escape the spell of the Master's 










personality. In the course of an article about Sri Ramakrishna, Pratap wrote in the "Theistic 










Quarterly Review": "What is there in common between him and me? I, a Europeanized, civilized, 










self-centered, semi-sceptical, so-called educated reasoner, and he, a poor, illiterate, unpolished, 










half-idolatrous, friendless Hindu devotee? Why should I sit long hours to attend to him, I, who 










have listened to Disraeli and Fawcett, Stanley and Max Muller, and a whole host of European 










scholars and divines? ... And it is not I only, but dozens like me, who do the same. ... He worships 










Siva, he worships Kali, he worships Rama, he worships Krishna, and is a confirmed advocate of 










Vedantic doctrines. ... He is an idolater, yet is a faithful and most devoted Meditator on the 










perfections of the One Formless, Absolute, Infinite Deity. ... His religion is ecstasy, his worship 










means transcendental insight, his whole nature burns day and night with a permanent fire and 










fever of a strange faith and feeling. ... So long as he is spared to us, gladly shall we sit at his feet to 





































learn from him the sublime precepts of purity, unworldliness, spirituality, and inebriation in the 










love of God. ... He, by his childlike bhakti, by his strong conceptions of an ever-ready Motherhood, 










helped to unfold it [God as our Mother] in our minds wonderfully. ... By associating with him we 










learnt to realize better the divine attributes as scattered over the three hundred and thirty millions 










of deities of mythological India, the gods of the Puranas." 



















The Brahmo leaders received much inspiration from their contact with Sri Ramakrishna. It 










broadened their religious views and kindled in their hearts the yearning for God-realization; it 










made them understand and appreciate the rituals and symbols of Hindu religion, convinced them 










of the manifestation of God in diverse forms, and deepened their thoughts about the harmony of 










religions. The Master, too, was impressed by the sincerity of many of the, Brahmo devotees. He 










told them about his own realizations and explained to them the essence of his teachings, such as 










the necessity of renunciation, sincerity in the pursuit of one's own course of discipline, faith in 










God, the performance of one's duties without thought of results, and discrimination between the 










Real and the unreal. 



















This contact with the educated and progressive Bengalis opened Sri Ramakrishna's eyes to a 










new realm of thought. Born and brought up in a simple village, without any formal education, and 










taught by the orthodox holy men of India in religious life, he had had no opportunity to study the 










influence of modernism on the thoughts and lives of the Hindus. He could not properly estimate 










the result of the impact of Western education on Indian culture. He was a Hindu of the Hindus, 










renunciation being to him the only means to the realization of God in life. From the Brahmos he 










learnt that the new generation of India made a compromise between God and the world. 










Educated young men were influenced more by the Western philosophers than by their own 










prophets. But Sri Ramakrishna was not dismayed, for he saw in this, too, the hand of God. And 










though he expounded to the Brahmos all his ideas about God and austere religious disciplines, yet 










he bade them accept from his teachings only as much as suited their tastes and temperaments. 



















THE MASTER'S YEARNING FOR HIS OWN DEVOTEES 



















Contact with the Brahmos increased Sri Ramakrishna's longing to encounter aspirants who 










would be able to follow his teachings in their purest form. "There was no limit", he once declared, 










"to the longing I felt at that time. During the day-time I somehow managed to control it. The 










secular talk of the worldly-minded was galling to me, and I would look wistfully to the day when 










my own beloved companions would come. I hoped to find solace in conversing with them and 










relating to them my own realizations. Every little incident would remind me of them, and thoughts 










of them wholly engrossed me. I was already arranging in my mind what I should say to one and 










give to another, and so on. But when the day would come to a close I would not be able to curb my 










feelings. The thought that another day had gone by, and they had not come, oppressed me. When, 










during the evening service, the temples rang with the sound of bells and conch-shells, I would 










climb to the roof of the Kuthi in the garden and, writhing in anguish of heart, cry at the top of my 










voice: 'Come, my children! Oh, where are you? I cannot bear to live without you.' A mother never 










longed so intensely for the sight of her child, nor a friend for his companions, nor a lover for his 










sweetheart, as I longed for them. Oh, it was indescribable! Shortly after this period of yearning the 










devotees began to come." 





































In the year 1879 occasional writings about Sri Ramakrishna by the Brahmos, in the Brahmo 










magazines, began to attract his future disciples from the educated middle-class Bengalis, and they 










continued to come till 1884. But others, too, came, feeling the subtle power of his attraction. They 










were an ever shifting crowd of people of all castes and creeds: Hindus and Brahmos, Vaishnavas 










and Saktas, the educated with university degrees and the illiterate, old and young, maharajas and 










beggars, journalists and artists, pundits and devotees, philosophers and the worldly-minded, jnanis 










and yogis, men of action and men of faith, virtuous women and prostitutes, office-holders and 










vagabonds, philanthropists and self-seekers, dramatists and drunkards, builders-up and 










pullers-down. He gave to them all, without stint, from his illimitable store of realization. No one 










went away empty-handed. He taught them the lofty knowledge of the Vedanta and the 










soul-melting love of the Purana. Twenty hours out of twenty-four he would speak without rest or 










respite. He gave to all his sympathy and enlightenment, and he touched them with that strange 










power of the soul which could not but melt even the most hardened. And people understood him 










according to their powers of comprehension. 



















THE MASTER'S METHOD OF TEACHING 



















But he remained as ever the willing instrument in the hand of God, the child of the Divine 










Mother, totally untouched by the idea of being a teacher. He used to say that three ideas - that he 










was a guru, a father, and a master - pricked his flesh like thorns. Yet he was an extraordinary 










teacher. He stirred his disciples' hearts more by a subtle influence than by actions or words. He 










never claimed to be the founder of a religion or the organizer of a sect. Yet he was a religious 










dynamo. He was the verifier of all religions and creeds. He was like an expert gardener, who 










prepares the soil and removes the weeds, knowing that the plants will grow because of the 










inherent power of the seeds, producing each its appropriate flowers and fruits. He never thrust his 










ideas on anybody. He understood people's limitations and worked on the principle that what is 










good for one may be bad for another. He had the unusual power of knowing the devotees' minds, 










even their inmost souls, at the first sight. He accepted disciples with the full knowledge of their 










past tendencies and future possibilities. The life of evil did not frighten him, nor did religious 










squeamishness raise anybody in his estimation. He saw in everything the unerring finger of the 










Divine Mother. Even the light that leads astray was to him the light from God. 



















To those who became his intimate disciples the Master was a friend, companion, and 










playmate. Even the chores of religious discipline would be lightened in his presence. The devotees 










would be so inebriated with pure joy in his company that they would have no time to ask 










themselves whether he was an Incarnation, a perfect soul, or a yogi. His very presence was a great 










teaching; words were superfluous. In later years his disciples remarked that while they were with 










him they would regard him as a comrade, but afterwards would tremble to think of their frivolities 










in the presence of such a great person. They had convincing proof that the Master could, by his 










mere wish, kindle in their hearts the love of God and give them His vision. 



















Through all this fun and frolic, this merriment and frivolity, he always kept before them the 










shining ideal of God-Consciousness and the path of renunciation. He prescribed ascents steep or 










graded according to the powers of the climber. He permitted no compromise with the basic 










principles of purity. An aspirant had to keep his body, mind, senses, and soul unspotted; had to 





































have a sincere love for God and an ever mounting spirit of yearning. The rest would be done by the 










Mother. 



















His disciples were of two kinds: the householders, and the young men, some of whom were 










later to become monks. There was also a small group of women devotees. 



















HOUSE HOLDER DEVOTEES 



















For the householders Sri Ramakrishna did not prescribe the hard path of total renunciation. 










He wanted them to discharge their obligations to their families. Their renunciation was to be 










mental. Spiritual life could not he acquired by flying away from responsibilities. A married couple 










should live like brother and sister after the birth of one or two children, devoting their time to 










spiritual talk and contemplation. He encouraged the householders, saying that their life was, in a 










way, easier than that of the monk, since it was more advantageous to fight the enemy from inside 










a fortress than in an open field. He insisted, however, on their repairing into solitude every now 










and then to strengthen their devotion and faith in God through prayer, japa, and meditation. He 










prescribed for them the companionship of sadhus. He asked them to perform their worldly duties 










with one hand, while holding to God with the other, and to pray to God to make their duties fewer 










and fewer so that in the end they might cling to Him with both hands. He would discourage in both 










the householders and the celibate youths any lukewarmness in their spiritual struggles. He would 










not ask them to follow indiscriminately the ideal of non-resistance, which ultimately makes a 










coward of the unwary. 



















FUTURE MONKS 



















But to the young men destined to be monks he pointed out the steep path of renunciation, 










both external and internal. They must take the vow of absolute continence and eschew all thought 










of greed and lust. By the practice of continence, aspirants develop a subtle nerve through which 










they understand the deeper mysteries of God. For them self-control is final, imperative, and 










absolute. The sannyasis are teachers of men, and their lives should be totally free from blemish. 










They must not even look at a picture which may awaken their animal passions. The Master 










selected his future monks from young men untouched by "woman and gold" and plastic enough to 










be cast in his spiritual mould. When teaching them the path of renunciation and discrimination, he 










would not allow the householders to be any where near them. 



















RAM AND MANOMOHAN 



















The first two householder devotees to come to Dakshineswar were Ram Chandra Dutta and 










Manomohan Mitra. A medical practitioner and chemist, Ram was sceptical about God and religion 










and never enjoyed peace of soul. He wanted tangible proof of God's existence. The Master said to 










him: "God really exists. You don't see the stars in the daytime, but that doesn't mean that the stars 










do not exist. There is butter in milk. But can anybody see it by merely looking at the milk? To get 










butter you must churn milk in a quiet and cool place. You cannot realize God by a mere wish; you 










must go through some mental disciplines." By degrees the Master awakened Ram's spirituality and 










the latter became one of his foremost lay disciples. It was Ram who introduced Narendranath to 










Sri Ramakrishna. Narendra was a relative of Ram. 





































Manomohan at first met with considerable opposition from his wife and other relatives, 










who resented his visits to Dakshineswar. But in the end the unselfish love of the Master triumphed 










over worldly affection. It was Manomohan who brought Rakhal to the Master. 



















SURENDRA 



















Suresh Mitra, a beloved disciple whom the Master often addressed as Surendra, had 










received an English education and held an important post in an English firm. Like many other 










educated young men of the time, he prided himself on his atheism and led a Bohemian life. He was 










addicted to drinking. He cherished an exaggerated notion about man's free will. A victim of mental 










depression, he was brought to Sri Ramakrishna by Ramchandra Dutta. When he heard the Master 










asking a disciple to practise the virtue of self-surrender to God, he was impressed. But though he 










tried thenceforth to do so, he was unable to give up his old associates and his drinking. One day 










the Master said in his presence, "Well, when a man goes to an undesirable place, why doesn't he 










take the Divine Mother with him?" And to Surendra himself Sri Ramakrishna said: "Why should you 










drink wine as wine? Offer it to Kali, and then take it as Her Prasad, as consecrated drink. But see 










that you don't, become intoxicated; you must not reel and your thoughts must not wander. At first 










you will feel ordinary excitement, but soon you will experience spiritual exaltation." Gradually 










Surendra's entire life was changed. The Master designated him as one of those commissioned by 










the Divine Mother to defray a great part of his expenses. Surendra's purse was always open for the 










Master's comfort. 



















kedAr 



















Kedarnath Chatterji was endowed with a spiritual temperament and had tried various paths 










of religion, some not very commendable. When he met the Master at Dakshineswar he 










understood the true meaning of religion. It is said that the Master, weary of instructing devotees 










who were coming to him in great numbers for guidance, once prayed to the Goddess Kali: 










"Mother, I am tired of speaking to people. Please give power to Kedar, Girish, Ram, Vijay, and 










Mahendra to give them the preliminary instruction, so that just a little teaching from me will be 










enough." He was aware, however, of Kedar's lingering attachment to worldly things and often 










warned him about it. 



















HARISH 



















Harish, a young man in affluent circumstances, renounced his family and took shelter with 










the Master, who loved him for his sincerity, singleness of purpose, and quiet nature. He spent his 










leisure time in prayer and meditation, turning a deaf ear to the entreaties and threats of his 










relatives. Referring to his undisturbed peace of mind, the Master would say: "Real men are dead to 










the world though, living. Look at Harish. He is an example." When one day the Master asked him to 










be a little kind to his wife, Harish said: "You must excuse me on this point. This is not the place to 










show kindness. If I try to be sympathetic to her, there is a possibility of my forgetting the ideal and 










becoming entangled in the world." 





































bhavanAth 



















Bhavanath Chatterji visited the Master while he was still in his teens. His parents and 










relatives regarded Sri Ramakrishna as an insane person and tried their utmost to prevent him from 










becoming intimate with the Master. But the young boy was very stubborn and often spent nights 










at Dakshineswar. He was greatly attached to Narendra, and the Master encouraged their 










friendship. The very sight of him often awakened Sri Ramakrishna's spiritual emotion. 



















balarAm bose 



















Balaram Bose came of a wealthy Vaishnava family. From his youth he had shown a deep 










religious temperament and had devoted his time to meditation, prayer, and the study of the 










Vaishnava scriptures. He was very much impressed by Sri Ramakrishna even at their first meeting. 










He asked Sri Ramakrishna whether God really existed and, if so, whether a man could realize Him. 










The Master said: "God reveals Himself to the devotee who thinks of Him as his nearest and 










dearest. Because you do not draw response by praying to Him once, you must not conclude that 










He does not exist. Pray to God, thinking of Him as dearer than your very self. He is much attached 










to His devotees. He comes to a man even before He is sought. There is none more intimate and 










affectionate than God." Balaram had never before heard God spoken of in such forceful words; 










every one of the words seemed true to him. Under the Master's influence he outgrew the 










conventions of the Vaishnava worship and became one of the most beloved of the disciples. It was 










at his home that the Master slept whenever he spent a night in Calcutta. 



















MAHENDRA OR M. 



















Mahendranath Gupta, known as "M.", arrived at Dakshineswar in February 1882. He 










belonged to the Brahmo Samaj and was headmaster of the Vidyasagar High School at Syambazar, 










Calcutta. At the very first sight the Master recognized him as one of his "marked" disciples. 










Mahendra recorded in his diary Sri Ramakrishna's conversations with his devotees. These are the 










first directly recorded words, in the spiritual history of the world, of a man recognized as belonging 










in the class of Buddha and Christ. The present volume is a translation of this diary. Mahendra was 










instrumental, through his personal contacts, in spreading the Master's message among many 










young and aspiring souls. 



















nAg mahAshay 



















Durgacharan Nag, also known as Nag Mahashay, was the ideal householder among the lay 










disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. He was the embodiment of the Master's ideal of life in the world, 










unstained by worldliness. In spite of his intense desire to become a sannyasi, Sri Ramakrishna 










asked him to live in the world in the spirit of a monk, and the disciple truly carried out this 










injunction. He was born of a poor family and even during his boyhood often sacrificed everything 










to lessen the sufferings of the needy. He had married at an early age and after his wife's death had 










married a second time to obey his father's command. But he once said to his wife: "Love on the 










physical level never lasts. He is indeed blessed who can give his love to God with his whole heart. 










Even a little attachment to the body endures for several births. So do not be attached to this cage 










of bone and flesh. Take shelter at the feet of the Mother and think of Her alone. Thus your life 





































here and hereafter will he ennobled." The Master spoke of him as a "blazing light". He received 










every word of Sri Ramakrishna in dead earnest. One day he heard the Master saying that it was 










difficult for doctors, lawyers, and brokers to make much progress in spirituality. Of doctors he said, 










"If the mind clings to the tiny drops of medicine, how can it conceive of the Infinite?" That was the 










end of Durgacharan's medical practice and he threw his chest of medicines into the Ganges. Sri 










Ramakrishna assured him that he would not lack simple food and clothing. He bade him serve holy 










men. On being asked where he would find real holy men, the Master said that the sadhus 










themselves would seek his company. No sannyasi could have lived a more austere life than 










Durgacharan. 



















GIRISH GHOSH 



















Girish Chandra Ghosh was a born rebel against God, a sceptic, a Bohemian, a drunkard. He 










was the greatest Bengali dramatist of his time, the father of the modern Bengali stage. Like other 










young men he had imbibed all the vices of the West. He had plunged into a life of dissipation and 










had become convinced that religion was only a fraud. Materialistic philosophy he justified as 










enabling one to get at least a little fun out of life. But a series of reverses shocked him and he 










became eager to solve the riddle of life. He had heard people say that in spiritual life the help of a 










guru was imperative and that the guru was to be regarded as God Himself. But Girish was too well 










acquainted with human nature to see perfection in a man. His first meeting with Sri Ramakrishna 










did not impress him at all. He returned home feeling as if he had seen a freak at a circus; for the 










Master, in a semi-conscious mood, had inquired whether it was evening, though the lamps were 










burning in the room. But their paths often crossed, and Girish could not avoid further encounters. 










The Master attended a performance in Girish's Star Theatre. On this occasion, too, Girish found 










nothing impressive about him. One day, however, Girish happened to see the Master dancing and 










singing with the devotees. He felt the contagion and wanted to join them, but restrained himself 










for fear of ridicule. Another day Sri Ramakrishna was about to give him spiritual instruction, when 










Girish said: "I don't want to listen to instructions. I have myself written many instructions. They are 










of no use to me. Please help me in a more tangible way if you can." This pleased the Master and he 










asked Girish to cultivate faith. 



















As time passed, Girish began to learn that the guru is the one who silently unfolds the 










disciple's inner life. He became a steadfast devotee of the Master. 



















He often loaded the Master with insults, drank in his presence, and took liberties which 










astounded the other devotees. But the Master knew that at heart Girish was tender, faithful, and 










sincere. He would not allow Girish to give up the theatre. And when a devotee asked him to tell 










Girish to give up drinking, he sternly replied: "That is none of your business. He who has taken 










charge of him will look after him. Girish is a devotee of heroic type. I tell you, drinking will not 










affect him." The Master knew that mere words could not induce a man to break deep-rooted 










habits, but that the silent influence of love worked miracles. Therefore he never asked him to give 










up alcohol, with the result that Girish himself eventually broke the habit. Sri Ramakrishna had 










strengthened Girish's resolution by allowing him to feel that he was absolutely free. 





































One day Girish felt depressed because he was unable to submit to any routine of spiritual 










discipline. In an exalted mood the Master said to him: "All right, give me your power of attorney. 










Henceforth I assume responsibility for you. You need not do anything." Girish heaved a sigh of 










relief. He felt happy to think that Sri Ramakrishna had assumed his spiritual responsibilities. But 










poor Girish could not then realize that he also, on his part, had to give up his freedom and make of 










himself a puppet in Sri Ramakrishna's hands. The Master began to discipline him according to this 










new attitude. One day Girish said about a trifling matter, "Yes, I shall do this." "No, no!" the Master 










corrected him. "You must not speak in that egotistic manner. You should say, 'God willing, I shall 










do it'." Girish understood. Thenceforth he tried to give up all idea of personal responsibility and 










surrender himself to the Divine Will. His mind began to dwell constantly on Sri Ramakrishna. This 










unconscious meditation in time chastened his turbulent spirit. 



















The householder devotees generally visited Sri Ramakrishna on Sunday afternoons and 










other holidays. Thus a brotherhood was gradually formed, and the Master encouraged their 










fraternal feeling. Now and then he would accept an invitation to a devotee's home, where other 










devotees would also be invited. Kirtan would be arranged and they would spend hours in dance 










and devotional music. The Master would go into trances or open his heart in religious discourses 










and in the narration of his own spiritual experiences. Many people who could not go to 










Dakshineswar participated in these meetings and felt blessed. Such an occasion would be 










concluded with a sumptuous feast. 



















But it was in the company of his younger devotees, pure souls yet unstained by the touch of 










worldliness, that Sri Ramakrishna took greatest joy. Among the young men who later embraced 










the householder's life were Narayan, Paltu, the younger Naren, Tejchandra and Purna. These 










visited the Master sometimes against strong opposition from home. 



















PURNA 



















Purna was a lad of thirteen, whom Sri Ramakrishna described as an Isvarakoti, a soul born 










with special spiritual qualities. The Master said that Purna was the last of the group of brilliant 










devotees who, as he once had seen in a trance, would come to him for spiritual illumination. Purna 










said to Sri Ramakrishna during their second meeting, "You are God Himself incarnated in flesh and 










blood." Such words coming from a mere youngster proved of what stuff the boy was made. 



















mahimAcharan and pratAp hazra 



















Mahimacharan and Pratap Hazra were two devotees outstanding for their pretentiousness 










and idiosyncrasies. But the Master showed them his unfailing love and kindness, though he was 










aware of their shortcomings. Mahimacharan Chakravarty had met the Master long before the 










arrival of the other disciples. He had had the intention of leading a spiritual life, but a strong desire 










to acquire name and fame was his weakness. He claimed to have been initiated by Totapuri and 










used to say that he had been following the path of knowledge according to his guru's instructions. 










He possessed a large library of English and Sanskrit books. But though he pretended to have read 










them, most of the leaves were uncut. The Master knew all his limitations, yet enjoyed listening to 










him recite from the Vedas and other scriptures. He would always exhort Mahima to meditate on 










the meaning of the scriptural texts and to practise spiritual discipline. 





































Pratap Hazra, a middle-aged man, hailed from a village near Kamarpukur. He was not 










altogether unresponsive to religious feelings. On a moment's impulse he had left his home, aged 










mother, wife, and children, and had found shelter in the temple garden at Dakshineswar, where he 










intended to lead a spiritual life. He loved to argue, and the Master often pointed him out as an 










example of barren argumentation. He was hypercritical of others and cherished an exaggerated 










notion of his own spiritual advancement. He was mischievous and often tried to upset the minds 










of the Master's young disciples, criticizing them for their happy and joyous life and asking them to 










devote their time to meditation. The Master teasingly compared Hazra to Jatila and Kutila, the two 










women who always created obstructions in Krishna's sport with the gopis, and said that Hazra 










lived at Dakshineswar to "thicken the plot" by adding complications. 



















SOME NOTED MEN 



















Sri Ramakrishna also became acquainted with a number of people whose scholarship or 










wealth entitled them everywhere to respect. He had met, a few years before, Devendranath 










Tagore, famous all over Bengal for his wealth, scholarship, saintly character, and social position. 










But the Master found him disappointing; for, whereas Sri Ramakrishna expected of a saint 










complete renunciation of the world, Devendranath combined with his saintliness a life of 










enjoyment. Sri Ramakrishna met the great poet Michael Madhusudan, who had embraced 










Christianity "for the sake of his stomach". To him the Master could not impart instruction, for the 










Divine Mother "pressed his tongue". In addition he met Maharaja Jatindra Mohan Tagore, a titled 










aristocrat of Bengal; Kristodas Pal, the editor, social reformer, and patriot; Iswar Chandra 










Vidyasagar, the noted philanthropist and educator; Pundit Sasadhar, a great champion of Hindu 










orthodoxy; Aswini Kumar Dutta, a headmaster, moralist, and leader of Indian Nationalism; and 










Bankim Chatterji, a deputy magistrate, novelist, and essayist, and one of the fashioners of modern 










Bengali prose. Sri Ramakrishna was not the man to be dazzled by outward show, glory, or 










eloquence. A pundit without discrimination he regarded as a mere straw. He would search 










people's hearts for the light of God, and if that was missing, he would have nothing to do with 










them. 



















KRISTODAS pAl 



















The Europeanized Kristodas Pal did not approve of the Master's emphasis on renunciation 










and said: "Sir, this cant of renunciation has almost ruined the country. It is for this reason that the 










Indians are a subject nation today. Doing good to others, bringing education to the door of the 










ignorant, and above all, improving the material conditions of the country - these should be our 










duty now. The cry of religion and renunciation would, on the contrary, only weaken us. You should 










advise the young men of Bengal to resort only to such acts as will uplift the country." Sri 










Ramakrishna gave him a searching look and found no divine light within. "You man of poor 










understanding!" Sri Ramakrishna said sharply. "You dare to slight in these terms renunciation and 










piety, which our scriptures describe as the greatest of all virtues! After reading two pages of 










English you think you have come to know the world! You appear to think you are omniscient. Well, 










have you seen those tiny crabs that are born in the Ganges just when the rains set in? In this big 










universe you are even less significant than one of those small creatures. How dare you talk of 










helping the world? The Lord will look to that. You haven't the power in you to do it." After a pause 





































the Master continued: "Can you explain to me how you can work for others? I know what you 










mean by helping them. To feed a number of persons, to treat them when they are sick, to 










construct a road or dig a well - Isn't that all? These are good deeds, no doubt, but how trifling in 










comparison with the vastness of the universe! How far can a man advance in this line? How many 










people can you save from famine? Malaria has ruined a whole province; what could you do to stop 










its onslaught? God alone looks after the world. Let a man first realize Him. Let a man get the 










authority from God and be endowed with His power; then, and then alone, may he think of doing 










good to others. A man should first be purged of all egotism. Then alone will the Blissful Mother ask 










him to work for the world." Sri Ramakrishna mistrusted philanthropy that presumed to pose as 










charity. He warned people against it. He saw in most acts of philanthropy nothing but egotism, 










vanity, a desire for glory, a barren excitement to kill the boredom of life, or an attempt to soothe a 










guilty conscience. True charity, he taught, is the result of love of God - service to man in a spirit of 










worship. 



















MONASTIC DISCIPLES 



















The disciples whom the Master trained for monastic life were the following: 



















1. Narendranath Dutta (Swami Vivekananda) 



















2. Nitya Niranjan Sen (Swami Niranjanananda) 



















3. Rakhal Chandra Ghosh (Swami Brahmananda) 



















4. Kaliprasad Chandra (Swami Abhedananda) 



















5. Gopal Chandra Ghosh (Swami Advaitananda) 



















6. Harinath Chattopadhyaya (Swami Turiyananda) 



















7. Baburam Ghosh (Swami Premananda) 



















8. Sarada Prasanna (Swami Trigunatitananda) 



















9. Taraknath Ghoshal (Swami Shivananda) 



















10. Gangadhar Ghatak (Swami Akhandananda) 



















11. Jogindranath Choudhury (Swami Yogananda) 



















12. Subodh Ghosh (Swami Subodhananda) 



















13. Sashibhushan Chakravarty (Swami Ramakrishnananda) 



















14. Saratchandra Chakravarty (Swami Saradananda) 



















15. Hariprasanna Chatterji (Swami Vijnanananda) 





































16. Latu (Swami Adhhutananda) 





































lAtu 



















The first of these young men to come to the Master was Latu. Born of obscure parents, in 










Behar, he came to Calcutta in search of work and was engaged by Ramchandra Dutta as 










house-boy. Learning of the saintly Sri Ramakrishna, he visited the Master at Dakshineswar and was 










deeply touched by his cordiality. When he was about to leave, the Master asked him to take some 










money and return home in a boat or carriage. But Latu declared he had a few pennies and jingled 










the coins in his pocket. Sri Ramakrishna later requested Ram to allow Latu to stay with him 










permanently. Under Sri Ramakrishna's guidance Latu made great progress in meditation and was 










blessed with ecstatic visions, but all the efforts of the Master to give him a smattering of education 










failed. Latu was very fond of kirtan and other devotional songs but remained all his life illiterate. 



















rAkhAl 



















Even before RakhaTs coming to Dakshineswar, the Master had had visions of him as his 










spiritual son and as a playmate of Krishna at Vrindavan. Rakhal was born of wealthy parents. 










During his childhood he developed wonderful spiritual traits and used to play at worshipping gods 










and goddesses. In his teens he was married to a sister of Manomohan Mitra, from whom he first 










heard of the Master. His father objected to his association with Sri Ramakrishna but afterwards 










was reassured to find that many celebrated people were visitors at Dakshineswar. The relationship 










between the Master and this beloved disciple was that of mother and child. Sri Ramakrishna 










allowed Rakhal many liberties denied to others. But he would not hesitate to chastise the boy for 










improper actions. At one time Rakhal felt a childlike jealousy because he found that other boys 










were receiving the Master's affection. He soon got over it and realized his guru as the Guru of the 










whole universe. The Master was worried to hear of his marriage, but was relieved to find that his 










wife was a spiritual soul who would not be a hindrance to his progress. 



















THE ELDER GOPAL 



















Gopal Chandra Ghosh came to Dakshineswar at a rather advanced age and was called the 










elder Gopal. He had lost his wife, and the Master assuaged his grief. Soon he renounced the world 










and devoted himself fully to meditation and prayer. Some years later Gopal gave the Master the 










ochre cloths with which the latter initiated several of his disciples into monastic life. 



















NARENDRA 



















To spread his message to the four corners of the earth Sri Ramakrishna needed a strong 










instrument. With his frail body and delicate limbs he could not make great journeys across wide 










spaces. And such an instrument was found in Narendranath Dutta, his beloved Naren, later known 










to the world as Swami Vivekananda. Even before meeting Narendranath, the Master had seen him 










in a vision as a sage, immersed in the meditation of the Absolute, who at Sri Ramakrishna's request 










had agreed to take human birth to assist him in his work. 



















Narendra was born in Calcutta on January 12, 1863, of an aristocratic Kayastha family. His 










mother was steeped in the great Hindu epics, and his father, a distinguished attorney of the 










Calcutta High Court, was an agnostic about religion, a friend of the poor, and a mocker at social 










conventions. Even in his boyhood and youth Narendra possessed great physical courage and 





































presence of mind, a vivid imagination, deep power of thought, keen intelligence, an extraordinary 










memory, a love of truth, a passion for purity, a spirit of independence, and a tender heart. An 










expert musician, he also acquired proficiency in physics, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, 










history, and literature. He grew up into an extremely handsome young man. Even as a child he 










practised meditation and showed great power of concentration. Though free and passionate in 










word and action, he took the vow of austere religious chastity and never allowed the fire of purity 










to be extinguished by the slightest defilement of body or soul. 



















As he read in college the rationalistic Western philosophers of the nineteenth century, his 










boyhood faith in God and religion was unsettled. He would not accept religion on mere faith; he 










wanted demonstration of God. But very soon his passionate nature discovered that mere Universal 










Reason was cold and bloodless. His emotional nature, dissatisfied with a mere abstraction, 










required a concrete support to help him in the hours of temptation. He wanted an external power, 










a guru, who by embodying perfection in the flesh would still the commotion of his soul. Attracted 










by the magnetic personality of Keshab, he joined the Brahmo Samaj and became a singer in its 










choir. But in the Samaj he did not find the guru who could say that he had seen God. 



















In a state of mental conflict and torture of soul, Narendra came to Sri Ramakrishna at 










Dakshineswar. He was then eighteen years of age and had been in college two years. He entered 










the Master's room accompanied by some light-hearted friends. At Sri Ramakrishna's request he 










sang a few songs, pouring his whole soul into them, and the Master went into Samadhi. A few 










minutes later Sri Ramakrishna suddenly left his seat, took Narendra by the hand, and led him to 










the screened verandah north of his room. They were alone. Addressing Narendra most tenderly, as 










if he were a friend of long acquaintance, the Master said: "Ah! You have come very late. Why have 










you been so unkind as to make me wait all these days? My ears are tired of hearing the futile 










words of worldly men. Oh, how I have longed to pour my spirit into the heart of someone fitted to 










receive my message!" He talked thus, sobbing all the time. Then, standing before Narendra with 










folded hands, he addressed him as Narayana, born on earth to remove the misery of humanity. 










Grasping Narendra's hand, he asked him to come again, alone, and very soon. Narendra was 










startled. "What is this I have come to see?" he said to himself. "He must be stark mad. Why, I am 










the son of Viswanath Dutta. How dare he speak this way to me?" 



















When they returned to the room and Narendra heard the Master speaking to others, he 










was surprised to find in his words an inner logic, a striking sincerity, and a convincing proof of his 










spiritual nature. In answer to Narendra's question, "Sir, have you seen 



















God?" the Master said: "Yes, I have seen God. I have seen Him more tangibly than I see you. 










I have talked to Him more intimately than I am talking to you." Continuing, the Master said: "But, 










my child, who wants to see God? People shed jugs of tears for money, wife, and children. But if 










they would weep for God for only one day they would surely see Him." Narendra was amazed. 










These words he could not doubt. This was the first time he had ever heard a man saying that he 










had seen God. But he could not reconcile these words of the Master with the scene that had taken 










place on the verandah only a few minutes before. He concluded that Sri Ramakrishna was a 










monomaniac, and returned home rather puzzled in mind. 





































During his second visit, about a month later, suddenly, at the touch of the Master, Narendra 










felt overwhelmed and saw the walls of the room and everything around him whirling and 










vanishing. "What are you doing to me?" he cried in terror. "I have my father and mother at home." 










He saw his own ego and the whole universe almost swallowed in a nameless void. With a laugh the 










Master easily restored him. Narendra thought he might have been hypnotized, but he could not 










understand how a monomaniac could cast a spell over the mind of a strong person like himself. He 










returned home more confused than ever, resolved to be henceforth on his guard before this 










strange man. 



















But during his third visit Narendra fared no better. This time, at the Master's touch, he lost 










consciousness entirely. While he was still in that state, Sri Ramakrishna questioned him concerning 










his spiritual antecedents and whereabouts, his mission in this world, and the duration of his mortal 










life. The answers confirmed what the Master himself had known and inferred. Among other things, 










he came to know that Narendra was a sage who had already attained perfection, and that the day 










he learnt his real nature he would give up his body in yoga, by an act of will. 



















A few more meetings completely removed from Narendra's mind the last traces of the 










notion that Sri Ramakrishna might be a monomaniac or wily hypnotist. His integrity, purity, 










renunciation, and unselfishness were beyond question. But Narendra could not accept a man, an 










imperfect mortal, as his guru. As a member of the Brahmo Samaj, he could not believe that a 










human intermediary was necessary between man and God. Moreover, he openly laughed at Sri 










Ramakrishna's visions as hallucinations. Yet in the secret chamber of his heart he bore a great love 










for the Master. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was grateful to the Divine Mother for sending him one who doubted his 










own realizations. Often he asked Narendra to test him as the money-changers test their coins. He 










laughed at Narendra's biting criticism of his spiritual experiences and Samadhi. When at times 










Narendra's sharp words distressed him, the Divine Mother Herself would console him, saying: 










"Why do you listen to him? In a few days he will believe your every word." He could hardly bear 










Narendra's absences. Often he would weep bitterly for the sight of him. Sometimes Narendra 










would find the Master's love embarrassing; and one day he sharply scolded him, warning him that 










such infatuation would soon draw him down to the level of its object. The Master was distressed 










and prayed to the Divine Mother. Then he said to Narendra: "You rogue, I won't listen to you any 










more. Mother says that I love you because I see God in you, and the day I no longer see God in you 










I shall not be able to bear even the sight of you." 



















The Master wanted to train Narendra in the teachings of the non-dualistic Vedanta 










philosophy. But Narendra, because of his Brahmo upbringing, considered it wholly blasphemous to 










look on man as one with his Creator. One day at the temple garden he laughingly said to a friend: 










"How silly! This jug is God! This cup is God! Whatever we see is God! And we too are God! Nothing 










could be more absurd." Sri Ramakrishna came out of his room and gently touched him. 










Spellbound, he immediately perceived that everything in the world was indeed God. A new 










universe opened around him. Returning home in a dazed state, he found there too that the food, 










the plate, the eater himself, the people around him, were all God. When he walked in the street, 










he saw that the cabs, the horses, the streams of people, the buildings, were all Brahman. He could 





































hardly go about his day's business. His parents became anxious about him and thought him ill. And 










when the intensity of the experience abated a little, he saw the world as a dream. Walking in the 










public square, he would strike his head against the iron railings to know whether they were real. It 










took him a number of days to recover his normal self. He had a foretaste of the great experiences 










yet to come and realized that the words of the Vedanta were true. 



















At the beginning of 1884 Narendra's father suddenly died of heart -failure, leaving the family 










in a state of utmost poverty. There were six or seven mouths to feed at home. Creditors were 










knocking at the door. Relatives who had accepted his father's unstinted kindness now became 










enemies, some even bringing suit to deprive Narendra of his ancestral home. Actually starving and 










barefoot, Narendra searched for a job, but without success. He began to doubt whether anywhere 










in the world there was such a thing as unselfish sympathy. Two rich women made evil proposals to 










him and promised to put an end to his distress; but he refused them with contempt. 



















Narendra began to talk of his doubt of the very existence of God. His friends thought he had 










become an atheist and piously circulated gossip adducing unmentionable motives for his unbelief. 










His moral character was maligned. Even some of the Master's disciples partly believed the gossip, 










and Narendra told these to their faces that only a coward believed in God through fear of suffering 










or hell. But he was distressed to think that Sri Ramakrishna, too, might believe these false reports. 










His pride revolted. He said to himself: "What does it matter? If a man's good name rests on such 










slender foundations, I don't care." But later on he was amazed to learn that the Master had never 










lost faith in him. To a disciple who complained about Narendra's degradation, Sri Ramakrishna 










replied: "Hush, you fool! The Mother has told me it can never be so. I won't look at you if you 










speak that way again." 



















The moment came when Narendra's distress reached its climax. He had gone the whole day 










without food. As he was returning home in the evening he could hardly lift his tired limbs. He sat 










down in front of a house in sheer exhaustion, too weak even to think. His mind began to wander. 










Then, suddenly, a divine power lifted the veil over his soul. He found the solution of the problem 










of the coexistence of divine justice and misery, the presence of suffering in the creation of a 










blissful Providence. He felt bodily refreshed, his soul was bathed in peace, and he slept serenely. 



















Narendra now realized that he had a spiritual mission to fulfil. He resolved to renounce the 










world, as his grandfather had renounced it, and he came to Sri Ramakrishna for his blessing. But 










even before he had opened his mouth, the Master knew what was in his mind and wept bitterly at 










the thought of separation. "I know you cannot lead a worldly life," he said, "but for my sake live in 










the world as long as I live." 



















One day, soon after, Narendra requested Sri Ramakrishna to pray to the Divine Mother to 










remove his poverty. Sri Ramakrishna bade him pray to Her himself, for She would certainly listen 










to his prayer. Narendra entered the shrine of Kali. As he stood before the image of the Mother, he 










beheld Her as a living Goddess, ready to give wisdom and liberation. Unable to ask Her for petty 










worldly things, he prayed only for knowledge and renunciation, love and liberation. The Master 










rebuked him for his failure to ask the Divine Mother to remove his poverty and sent him back to 










the temple. But Narendra, standing in Her presence, again forgot the purpose of his coming. Thrice 





































he went to the temple at the bidding of the Master, and thrice he returned, having forgotten in 










Her presence why he had come. He was wondering about it when it suddenly flashed in his mind 










that this was all the work of Sri Ramakrishna; so now he asked the Master himself to remove his 










poverty, and was assured that his family would not lack simple food and clothing. 



















This was a very rich and significant experience for Narendra. It taught him that Sakti, the 










Divine Power, cannot be ignored in the world and that in the relative plane the need of 










worshipping a Personal God is imperative. Sri Ramakrishna was overjoyed with the conversion. The 










next day, sitting almost on Narendra's lap, he said to a devotee, pointing first to himself, then to 










Narendra: "I see I am this, and again that. Really I feel no difference. A stick floating in the Ganges 










seems to divide the water; but in reality the water is one. Do you see my point? Well, whatever is, 










is the Mother - isn't that so?" In later years Narendra would say: "Sri Ramakrishna was the only 










person who, from the time he met me, believed in me uniformly throughout. Even my mother and 










brothers did not. It was his unwavering trust and love for me that bound me to him for ever. He 










alone knew how to love. Worldly people only make a show of love for selfish ends." 



















tArak 



















Others destined to be monastic disciples of Sri Ramakrishna came to Dakshineswar. 










Taraknath Ghoshal had felt from his boyhood the noble desire to realize God. Keshab and the 










Brahmo Samaj had attracted him but proved inadequate. In 1882 he first met the Master at 










Ramchandra's house and was astonished to hear him talk about Samadhi, a subject which always 










fascinated his mind. And that evening he actually saw a manifestation of that superconscious state 










in the Master. Tarak became a frequent visitor at Dakshineswar and received the Master's grace in 










abundance. The young boy often felt ecstatic fervour in meditation. He also wept profusely while 










meditating on God. Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "God favours those who can weep for Him. Tears 










shed for God wash away the sins of former births." 



















bAburAm 



















Baburam Ghosh came to Dakshineswar accompanied by Rakhal, his classmate. The Master, 










as was often his custom, examined the boy's physiognomy and was satisfied about his latent 










spirituality. At the age of eight Baburam had thought of leading a life of renunciation, in the 










company of a monk, in a hut shut out from the public view by a thick wall of trees. The very sight 










of the Panchavati awakened in his heart that dream of boyhood. Baburam was tender in body and 










soul. The Master used to say that he was pure to his very bones. One day Hazra in his usual 










mischievous fashion advised Baburam and some of the other young boys to ask Sri Ramakrishna 










for some spiritual powers and not waste their life in mere gaiety and merriment. The Master, 










scenting mischief, called Baburam to his side, and said: "What can you ask of me? Isn't everything 










that I have already yours? Yes, everything I have earned in the shape of realizations is for the sake 










of you all. So get rid of the idea of begging, which alienates by creating a distance. Rather realize 










your kinship with me and gain the key to all the treasures." 





































NIRANJAN 



















Nitya Niranjan Sen was a disciple of heroic type. He came to the Master when he was 










eighteen years old. He was a medium for a group of spiritualists. During his first visit the Master 










said to him: "My boy, if you think always of ghosts you will become a ghost, and if you think of God 










you will become God. Now, which do you prefer?" Niranjan severed all connections with the 










spiritualists. During his second visit the Master embraced him and said warmly: "Niranjan, my boy, 










the days are flitting away. When will you realize God? This life will be in vain if you do not realize 










Him. When will You devote your mind wholly to God?" Niranjan was surprised to see the Master's 










great anxiety for his spiritual welfare. He was a young man endowed with unusual spiritual parts. 










He felt disdain for worldly pleasures and was totally guileless, like a child. But he had a violent 










temper. One day, as he was coming in a country boat to Dakshineswar, some of his fellow 










passengers began to speak ill of the Master. Finding his protest futile, Niranjan began to rock the 










boat, threatening to sink it in midstream. That silenced the offenders. When he reported the 










incident to the Master, he was rebuked for his inability to curb his anger. 



















JOGINDRA 



















Jogindranath, on the other hand, was gentle to a fault. One day, under circumstances very 










like those that had evoked Niranjan's anger, he curbed his temper and held his peace instead of 










threatening Sri Ramakrishna's abusers. The Master, learning of his conduct, scolded him roundly. 










Thus to each the fault of the other was recommended as a virtue. The guru was striving to 










develop, in the first instance, composure, and in the second, mettle. The secret of his training was 










to build up, by a tactful recognition of the requirements of each given case, the character of the 










devotee. 



















Jogindranath came of an aristocratic brahmin family of Dakshineswar. His father and 










relatives shared the popular mistrust of Sri Ramakrishna's sanity. At a very early age the boy 










developed religious tendencies, spending two or three hours daily in meditation, and his meeting 










with Sri Ramakrishna deepened his desire for the realization of God. He had a perfect horror of 










marriage. But at the earnest request of his mother he had had to yield, and he now believed that 










his spiritual future was doomed. So he kept himself away from the Master. 



















Sri Ramakrishna employed a ruse to bring Jogindra to him. As soon as the disciple entered 










the room, the Master rushed forward to meet the young man. Catching hold of the disciple's hand, 










he said: "What if you have married, Haven't I too married? What is there to be afraid of in that?" 










Touching his own chest he said: "If this [meaning himself] is propitious, then even a hundred 










thousand marriages cannot injure you. It you desire to lead a householder's life, then bring your 










wife here one day, and I shall see that she becomes a real companion in your spiritual progress. 










But if you want to lead a monastic life, then I shall eat up your attachment to the world." Jogin 










was dumbfounded at these words. He received new strength, and his spirit of renunciation was 










re-established. 



















SASHI AND SARAT 



















Sashi and Sarat were two cousins who came from a pious brahmin family of Calcutta. At an 










early age they had joined the Brahmo Samaj and had come under the influence of Keshab Sen. The 





































Master said to them at their first meeting: "If bricks and tiles are burnt after the trade-mark has 










been stamped on them, they retain the mark for ever. Similarly, man should be stamped with God 










before entering the world. Then he will not become attached to worldliness." Fully aware of the 










future course of their life, he asked them not to marry. The Master asked Sashi whether he 










believed in God with form or in God without form. Sashi replied that he was not even sure about 










the existence of God; so he could not speak one way or the other. This frank answer very much 










pleased the Master. 



















Sarat's soul longed for the all-embracing realization of the Godhead. When the Master 










inquired whether there was any particular form of God he wished to see, the boy replied that he 










would like to see God in all the living beings of the world. "But", the Master demurred, "that is the 










last word in realization. One cannot have it at the very outset." Sarat stated calmly: "I won't be 










satisfied with anything short of that. I shall trudge on along the path till I attain that blessed state." 










Sri Ramakrishna was very much pleased. 



















harinAth 



















Harinath had led the austere life of a brahmachari even from his early boyhood -bathing in 










the Ganges every day, cooking his own meals, waking before sunrise, and reciting the Gita from 










memory before leaving bed. He found in the Master the embodiment of the Vedanta scriptures. 










Aspiring to be a follower of the ascetic Sankara, he cherished a great hatred for women. One day 










he said to the Master that he could not allow even small girls to come near him. The Master 










scolded him and said: "You are talking like a fool. Why should you hate women? They are the 










manifestations of the Divine Mother. Regard them as your own mother and you will never feel 










their evil influence. The more you hate them, the more you will fall into their snares." Hari said 










later that these words completely changed his attitude toward women. 



















The Master knew Hari's passion for Vedanta. But he did not wish any of his disciples to 










become a dry ascetic or a mere bookworm. So he asked Hari to practise Vedanta in life by giving 










up the unreal and following the Real. "But it is not so easy", Sri Ramakrishna said, "to realize the 










illusoriness of the world. Study alone does not help one very much. The grace of God is required. 










Mere personal effort is futile. A man is a tiny creature after all, with very limited powers. But he 










can achieve the impossible if he prays to God for His grace." Whereupon the Master sang a song in 










praise of grace. Hari was profoundly moved and shed tears. Later in life Hari achieved a wonderful 










synthesis of the ideals of the Personal God and the Impersonal Truth. 



















GANGADHAR 



















Gangadhar, Harinath's friend, also led the life of a strict brahmachari, eating vegetarian 










food cooked by his own hands and devoting himself to the study of the scriptures. He met the 










Master in 1884 and soon became a member of his inner circle. The Master praised his ascetic habit 










and attributed it to the spiritual disciplines of his past life. Gangadhar became a close companion 










of Narendra. 





































HARIPRASANNA 



















Hariprasanna, a college student, visited the Master in the company of his friends Sashi and 










Sarat. Sri Ramakrishna showed him great favour by initiating him into spiritual life. As long as he 










lived, Hariprasanna remembered and observed the following drastic advice of the Master: "Even if 










a woman is pure as gold and rolls on the ground for love of God, it is dangerous for a monk ever to 










look at her." 



















kAli 



















Kaliprasad visited the Master toward the end of 1883. Given to the practice of meditation 










and the study of the scriptures, Kali was particularly interested in yoga. Feeling the need of a guru 










in spiritual life, he came to the Master and was accepted as a disciple. The young boy possessed a 










rational mind and often felt sceptical about the Personal God. The Master said to him: "Your 










doubts will soon disappear. Others, too, have passed through such a state of mind. Look at Naren. 










He now weeps at the names of Radha and Krishna." Kali began to see visions of gods and 










goddesses. Very soon these disappeared and in meditation he experienced vastness, infinity, and 










the other attributes of the Impersonal Brahman. 



















SUBODH 



















Subodh visited the Master in 1885. At the very first meeting Sri Ramakrishna said to him: 










"You will succeed. Mother says so. Those whom She sends here will certainly attain spirituality." 










During the second meeting the Master wrote something on Subodh's tongue, stroked his body 










from the navel to the throat, and said, "Awake, Mother! Awake." He asked the boy to meditate. At 










once Subodh's latent spirituality was awakened. He felt a current rushing along the spinal column 










to the brain. Joy filled his soul. 



















SARADA and tulasi 



















Two more young men, Sarada Prasanna and Tulasi, complete the small band of the Master's 










disciples later to embrace the life of the wandering monk. With the exception of the elder Gopal, 










all of them were in their teens or slightly over. They came from middle class Bengali families, and 










most of them were students in school or college. Their parents and relatives had envisaged for 










them bright worldly careers. They came to Sri Ramakrishna with pure bodies, vigorous minds, and 










uncontaminated souls. All were born with unusual spiritual attributes. Sri Ramakrishna accepted 










them, even at first sight, as his children, relatives, friends, and companions. His magic touch 










unfolded them. And later each according to his measure reflected the life of the Master, becoming 










a torchbearer of his message across land and sea. 



















WOMAN DEVOTEES 



















With his woman devotees Sri Ramakrishna established a very sweet relationship. He himself 










embodied the tender traits of a woman; he had dwelt on the highest plane of Truth, where there is 










not even the slightest trace of sex; and his innate purity evoked only the noblest emotion in men 










and women alike. His woman devotees often said: "We seldom looked on Sri Ramakrishna as a 










member of the male sex. We regarded him as one of us. We never felt any constraint before him, 





































He was our best confidant." They loved him as their child, their friend, and their teacher. In 










spiritual discipline he advised them to renounce lust and greed and especially warned them not to 










fall into the snares of men. 



















gopAl MA 



















Unsurpassed among the woman devotees of the Master in the richness of her devotion and 










spiritual experiences was Aghoramani Devi, an orthodox brahmin woman. Widowed at an early 










age, she had dedicated herself completely to spiritual pursuits. Gopala, the Baby Krishna, was her 










Ideal Deity, whom she worshipped following the Vatsalya attitude of the Vaishnava religion, 










regarding Him as her own child. Through Him she satisfied her unassuaged maternal love, cooking 










for Him, feeding Him, bathing Him, and putting Him to bed. This sweet intimacy with Gopala won 










her the sobriquet of Gopal Ma, or Gopala's Mother. For forty years she had lived on the bank of 










the Ganges in a small bare room, her only companions being a threadbare copy of the Ramayana 










and a bag containing her rosary. At the age of sixty, in 1884, she visited Sri Ramakrishna at 










Dakshineswar. During the second visit, as soon as the Master saw her, he said: "Oh, you have 










come! Give me something to eat." With great hesitation she gave him some ordinary sweets that 










she had purchased for him on the way. The Master ate them with relish and asked her to bring him 










simple curries or sweets prepared by her own hands. Gopal Ma thought him a queer kind of monk, 










for, instead of talking of God, he always asked for food. She did not want to visit him again, but an 










irresistible attraction brought her back to the temple garden. She carried with her some simple 










curries that she had cooked herself. 



















One early morning at three o'clock, about a year later, Gopal Ma was about to finish her 










daily devotions, when she was startled to find Sri Ramakrishna sitting on her left, with his right 










hand clenched, like the hand of the image of Gopala. She was amazed and caught hold of the 










hand, whereupon the figure vanished and in its place appeared the real Gopala, her Ideal Deity. 










She cried aloud with joy. Gopala begged her for butter. She pleaded her poverty and gave Him 










some dry coconut candies. Gopala sat on her lap, snatched away her rosary, jumped on her 










shoulders, and moved all about the room. As soon as the day broke she hastened to Dakshineswar 










like an insane woman. Of course 



















Gopala accompanied her, resting His head on her shoulder. She clearly saw His tiny ruddy 










feet hanging over her breast. She entered Sri Ramakrishna's room. The Master had fallen into 










Samadhi. Like a child, he sat on her lap, and she began to feed him with butter, cream, and other 










delicacies. After some time he regained consciousness and returned to his bed. But the mind of 










Gopala's Mother was still roaming in another plane. She was steeped in bliss. She saw Gopala 










frequently entering the Master's body and again coming out of it. When she returned to her hut, 










still in a dazed condition, Gopala accompanied her. 



















She spent about two months in uninterrupted communion with God, the Baby Gopala never 










leaving her for a moment. Then the intensity of her vision was lessened; had it not been, her body 










would have perished. The Master spoke highly of her exalted spiritual condition and said that such 










vision of God was a rare thing for ordinary mortals. The fun-loving Master one day confronted the 










critical Narendranath with this simple-minded woman. No two could have presented a more 





































striking contrast. The Master knew of Narendra's lofty contempt for all visions, and he asked the 










old lady to narrate her experiences to Narendra. With great hesitation she told him her story. Now 










and then she interrupted her maternal chatter to ask Narendra: "My son, I am a poor ignorant 










woman. I don't understand anything. You are so learned. Now tell me if these visions of Gopala are 










true." As Narendra listened to the story he was profoundly moved. He said, "Yes, mother, they are 










quite true." Behind his cynicism Narendra, too, possessed a heart full of love and tenderness. 



















THE MARCH OF EVENTS 



















In 1882 Hriday was, dismissed from service in the Kali temple, for an act of indiscretion, 










and was ordered by the authorities never again to enter the garden. In a way the hand of the 










Divine Mother may be seen even in this. Having taken care of Sri Ramakrishna during the stormy 










days of his spiritual discipline, Hriday had come naturally to consider himself the sole guardian of 










his uncle. None could approach the Master without his knowledge. And he would be extremely 










jealous if Sri Ramakrishna paid attention to anyone else. Hriday's removal made it possible for the 










real devotees of the Master to approach him freely and live with him in the temple garden. 



















During the week-ends the householders, enjoying a respite from their office duties, visited 










the Master. The meetings on Sunday afternoons were of the nature of little festivals. 










Refreshments were often served. Professional musicians now and then sang devotional songs. The 










Master and the devotees sang and danced, Sri Ramakrishna frequently going into ecstatic moods. 










The happy memory of such a Sunday would linger long in the minds of the devotees. Those whom 










the Master wanted for special instruction he would ask to visit him on Tuesdays and Saturdays. 










These days were particularly auspicious for the worship of Kali. 



















The young disciples destined to be monks, Sri Ramakrishna invited on week-days, when the 










householders were not present. The training of the householders and of the future monks had to 










proceed along entirely different lines. Since M. generally visited the Master on week-ends, the 










Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna does not contain much mention of the future monastic disciples. 



















Finally, there was a handful of fortunate disciples, householders as well as youngsters, who 










were privileged to spend nights with the Master in his room. They would see him get up early in 










the morning and walk up and down the room, singing in his sweet voice and tenderly communing 










with the Mother. 



















INJURY TO THE MASTER'S ARM 



















One day, in January 1884, the Master was going toward the pine-grove when he went into a 










trance. He was alone. There was no one to support him or guide his footsteps. He fell to the 










ground and dislocated a bone in his left arm. This accident had a significant influence on his mind, 










the natural inclination of which was to soar above the consciousness of the body. The acute pain in 










the arm forced his mind to dwell on the body and on the world outside. But he saw even in this a 










divine purpose; for, with his mind compelled to dwell on the physical plane, he realized more than 










ever that he was an instrument in the hand of the Divine Mother, who had a mission to fulfil 










through his human body and mind. He also distinctly found that in the phenomenal world God 










manifests Himself, in an inscrutable way, through diverse human beings, both good and evil. Thus 





































he would speak of God in the guise of the wicked, God in the guise of the pious, God in the guise of 










the hypocrite, God in the guise of the lewd. He began to take a special delight in watching the 










divine play in the relative world. Sometimes the sweet human relationship with God would appear 










to him more appealing than the all-effacing Knowledge of Brahman. Many a time he would pray: 










"Mother, don't make me unconscious through the Knowledge of Brahman. Don't give me 










Brahmajnana, Mother. Am I not Your child, and naturally timid? I must have my Mother. A million 










salutations to the Knowledge of Brahman! Give it to those who want it." Again he prayed: "0 










Mother, let me remain in contact with men! Don't make me a dried-up ascetic. I want to enjoy 










Your sport in the world." He was able to taste this very rich divine experience and enjoy the love of 










God and the company of His devotees because his mind, on account of the injury to his arm, was 










forced to come down to the consciousness of the body. Again, he would make fun of people who 










proclaimed him as a Divine Incarnation, by pointing to his broken arm. He would say, "Have you 










ever heard of God breaking His arm?" It took the arm about five months to heal. 



















BEGINNING OF HIS ILLNESS 



















In April 1885 the Master's throat became inflamed. Prolonged conversation or absorption in 










Samadhi, making the blood flow into the throat, would aggravate the pain. Yet when the annual 










Vaishnava festival was celebrated at Panihati, Sri Ramakrishna attended it against the doctor's 










advice. With a group of disciples he spent himself in music, dance, and ecstasy. The illness took a 










turn for the worse and was diagnosed as "clergyman's sore throat". The patient was cautioned 










against conversation and ecstasies. Though he followed the physician's directions regarding 










medicine and diet, he could neither control his trances nor withhold from seekers the solace of his 










advice. Sometimes, like a sulky child, he would complain to the Mother about the crowds, who 










gave him no rest day or night. He was overheard to say to Her: "Why do You bring here all these 










worthless people, who are like milk diluted with five times its own quantity of water? My eyes are 










almost destroyed with blowing the fire to dry up the water. My health is gone. It is beyond my 










strength. Do it Yourself, if You want it done. This (pointing to his own body) is but a perforated 










drum, and if you go on beating it day in and day out, how long will it last?" 



















But his large heart never turned anyone away. He said, "Let me be condemned to be born 










over and over again, even in the form of a dog, if I can be of help to a single soul." And he bore the 










pain, singing cheerfully, "Let the body be preoccupied with illness, but, mind, dwell for ever in 










God's Bliss!" 



















One night he had a haemorrhage of the throat. The doctor now diagnosed the illness as 










cancer. Narendra was the first to break this heart-rending news to the disciples. Within three days 










the Master was removed to Calcutta for better treatment. At Balaram's house he remained a week 










until a suitable place could be found at Syampukur, in the northern section of Calcutta. During this 










week he dedicated himself practically without respite to the instruction of those beloved devotees 










who had been unable to visit him oftener at Dakshineswar. Discourses incessantly flowed from his 










tongue, and he often went into Samadhi. Dr. Mahendra Sarkar, the celebrated homeopath of 










Calcutta, was invited to undertake his treatment. 





































syAmpukur 



















In the beginning of September 1885 Sri Ramakrishna was moved to Syampukur. Here 










Narendra organized the young disciples to attend the Master day and night. At first they concealed 










the Master's illness from their guardians; but when it became more serious they remained with 










him almost constantly, sweeping aside the objections of their relatives and devoting themselves 










whole-heartedly to the nursing of their beloved guru. These young men, under the watchful eyes 










of the Master and the leadership of Narendra, became the Antaranga Bhaktas, the devotees of Sri 










Ramakrishna's inner circle. They were privileged to witness many manifestations of the Master's 










divine powers. Narendra received instructions regarding the propagation of his message after his 










death. 



















The Holy Mother - so Sarada Devi had come to be affectionately known by Sri 










Ramakrishna's devotees - was brought from Dakshineswar to look after the general cooking and to 










prepare the special diet of the patient. The dwelling space being extremely limited, she had to 










adapt herself to cramped conditions. At three o'clock in the morning she would finish her bath in 










the Ganges and then enter a small covered place on the roof, where she spent the whole day 










cooking and praying. After eleven at night, when the visitors went away, she would come down to 










her small bedroom on the first floor to enjoy a few hours' sleep. Thus she spent three months, 










working hard, sleeping little, and praying constantly for the Master's recovery. 



















At Syampukur the devotees led an intense life. Their attendance on the Master was in itself 










a form of spiritual discipline. His mind was constantly soaring to an exalted plane of consciousness. 










Now and then they would catch the contagion of his spiritual fervour. 



















They sought to divine the meaning of this illness of the Master, whom most of them had 










accepted as an Incarnation of God. One group, headed by Girish with his robust optimism and 










great power of imagination, believed that the illness was a mere pretext to serve a deeper 










purpose. The Master had willed his illness in order to bring the devotees together and promote 










solidarity among them. As soon as this purpose was served, he would himself get rid of the 










disease. A second group thought that the Divine Mother, in whose hand the Master was an 










instrument, had brought about this illness to serve Her own mysterious ends. But the young 










rationalists, led by Narendra, refused to ascribe a supernatural cause to a natural phenomenon. 










They believed that the Master's body, a material thing, was subject, like all other material things, 










to physical laws. Growth, development, decay, and death were laws of nature to which the 










Master's body could not but respond. But though holding differing views, they all believed that it 










was to him alone that they must look for the attainment of their spiritual goal. 



















In spite of the physician's efforts and the prayers and nursing of the devotees, the illness 










rapidly progressed. The pain sometimes appeared to be unbearable. The Master lived only on 










liquid food, and his frail body was becoming a mere skeleton. Yet his face always radiated joy, and 










he continued to welcome the visitors pouring in to receive his blessing. When certain zealous 










devotees tried to keep the visitors away, they were told by Girish, "You cannot succeed in it; he 










has been born for this very purpose - to sacrifice himself for the redemption of others." 





































The more the body was devastated by illness, the more it became the habitation of the 










Divine Spirit. Through its transparency the gods and goddesses began to shine with ever increasing 










luminosity. On the day of the Kali Puja the devotees clearly saw in him the manifestation of the 










Divine Mother. 



















It was noticed at this time that some of the devotees were making an unbridled display of 










their emotions. A number of them, particularly among the householders, began to cultivate, 










though at first unconsciously, the art of shedding tears, shaking the body, contorting the face, and 










going into trances, attempting thereby to imitate the Master. They began openly to declare Sri 










Ramakrishna a Divine Incarnation and to regard themselves as his chosen people, who could 










neglect religious disciplines with impunity. Narendra's penetrating eye soon sized up the situation. 










He found out that some of these external manifestations were being carefully practised at home, 










while some were the outcome of malnutrition, mental weakness, or nervous debility. He 










mercilessly exposed the devotees who were pretending to have visions, and asked all to develop a 










healthy religious spirit. Narendra sang inspiring songs for the younger devotees, read with them 










the Imitation of Christ and the Gita, and held before them the positive ideals of spirituality. 



















LAST DAYS AT COSSIPORE 



















When Sri Ramakrishna's illness showed signs of aggravation, the devotees, following the 










advice of Dr. Sarkar, rented a spacious garden house at Cossipore, in the northern suburbs of 










Calcutta. The Master was removed to this place on December 11, 1885. 



















It was at Cossipore that the curtain fell on the varied activities of the Master's life on the 










physical plane. His soul lingered in the body eight months more. It was the period of his great 










Passion, a constant crucifixion of the body and the triumphant revelation of the Soul. Here one 










sees the humanity and divinity of the Master passing and repassing across a thin border line. Every 










minute of those eight months was suffused with touching tenderness of heart and breath-taking 










elevation of spirit. Every word he uttered was full of pathos and sublimity. 



















It took the group only a few days to become adjusted to the new environment. The Holy 










Mother, assisted by Sri Ramakrishna's niece, Lakshmi Devi, and a few woman devotees, took 










charge of the cooking for the Master and his attendants. Surendra willingly bore the major portion 










of the expenses, other householders contributing according to their means. Twelve disciples were 










constant attendants of the Master: Narendra, Rakhal, Baburam, Niranjan, Jogin, Latu, Tarak, the 










elder Gopal, Kali, Sashi, Sarat, and the younger Gopal. Sarada, Harish, Hari, Gangadhar, and Tulasi 










visited the Master from time to time and practised sadhana at home. Narendra, preparing for his 










law examination, brought his books to the garden house in order to continue his studies during the 










infrequent spare moments. He encouraged his brother disciples to intensify their meditation, 










scriptural studies, and other spiritual disciplines. They all forgot their relatives and their worldly 










duties. 



















Among the attendants Sashi was the embodiment of service. He did not practise 










meditation, japa, or any of the other disciplines followed by his brother devotees. He was 










convinced that service to the guru was the only religion for him. He forgot food and rest and was 










ever ready at the Master's bedside. 





































Pundit Sasadhar one day suggested to the Master that the latter could remove the illness by 










concentrating his mind on the throat, the scriptures having declared that yogis had power to cure 










themselves in that way. The Master rebuked the pundit. "For a scholar like you to make such a 










proposal!" he said. "How can I withdraw the mind from the Lotus Feet of God and turn it to this 










worthless cage of flesh and blood?" "For our sake at least", begged Narendra and the other 










disciples. "But", replied Sri Ramakrishna, "do you think I enjoy this suffering? I wish to recover, but 










that depends on the Mother." 



















A few hours later the Master said to Narendra: "I said to Her: 'Mother, I cannot swallow 










food because of my pain. Make it possible for me to eat a little.' She pointed you all out to me and 










said: 'What? You are eating enough through all these mouths. Isn't that so?' I was ashamed and 










could not utter another word." This dashed all the hopes of the devotees for the Master's 










recovery. 



















"I shall make the whole thing public before I go", the Master had said some time before. On 










January 1, 1886, he felt better and came down to the garden for a little stroll. It was about three 










o'clock in the afternoon. Some thirty lay disciples were in the hall or sitting about under the trees. 










Sri Ramakrishna said to Girish, "Well, Girish, what have you seen in me, that you proclaim me 










before everybody as an Incarnation of God?" Girish was not the man to be taken by surprise. He 










knelt before the Master and said with folded hands, "What can an insignificant person like myself 










say about the One whose glory even sages like Vyasa and Valmiki could not adequately measure?" 










The Master was profoundly moved. He said: "What more shall I say? I bless you all. Be illumined!" 










He fell into a spiritual mood. Hearing these words the devotees, one and all, became overwhelmed 










with emotion. They rushed to him and fell at his feet. He touched them all, and each received an 










appropriate benediction. Each of them, at the touch of the Master, experienced ineffable bliss. 










Some laughed, some wept, some sat down to meditate, some began to pray. Some saw light, some 










had visions of their Chosen Ideals, and some felt within their bodies the rush of spiritual power. 



















Narendra, consumed with a terrific fever for realization, complained to the Master that all 










the others had attained peace and that he alone was dissatisfied. The Master asked what he 










wanted. Narendra begged for Samadhi, so that he might altogether forget the world for three or 










four days at a time. "You are a fool", the Master rebuked him. "There is a state even higher than 










that. Isn't it you who sing, 'All that exists art Thou'? First of all settle your family affairs and then 










come to me. You will experience a state even higher than Samadhi." 



















The Master did not hide the fact that he wished to make Narendra his spiritual heir. 










Narendra was to continue the work after Sri Ramakrishna's passing. Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "I 










leave these young men in your charge. See that they develop their spirituality and do not return 










home." One day he asked the boys, in preparation for a monastic life, to beg their food from door 










to door without thought of caste. They hailed the Master's order and went out with 










begging-bowls. A few days later he gave the ochre cloth of the sannyasi to each of them, including 










Girish, who was now second to none in his spirit of renunciation. Thus the Master himself laid the 










foundation of the future Ramakrishna Order of monks. 





































Sri Ramakrishna was sinking day by day. His diet was reduced to a minimum and he found it 










almost impossible to swallow. He whispered to M.: "I am bearing all this cheerfully, for otherwise 










you would be weeping. If you all say that it is better that the body should go rather than suffer this 










torture, I am willing." The next morning he said to his depressed disciples seated near the bed: "Do 










you know what I see? I see that God alone has become everything. Men and animals are only 










frameworks covered with skin, and it is He who is moving through their heads and limbs. I see that 










it is God Himself who has become the block, the executioner, and the victim for the sacrifice." He 










fainted with emotion. Regaining partial consciousness, he said: "Now I have no pain. I am very 










well." Looking at Latu he said: "There sits Latu resting his head on the palm of his hand. To me it is 










the Lord who is seated in that posture." 



















The words were tender and touching. Like a mother he caressed Narendra and Rakhal, 










gently stroking their faces. He said in a half whisper to M., "Had this body been allowed to last a 










little longer, many more souls would have been illumined." He paused a moment and then said: 










"But Mother has ordained otherwise. She will take me away lest, finding me guileless and foolish, 










people should take advantage of me and persuade me to bestow on them the rare gifts of 










spirituality." A few minutes later he touched his chest and said: "Here are two beings. One is She 










and the other is Her devotee. It is the latter who broke his arm, and it is he again who is now ill. Do 










you understand me?" After a pause he added: "Alas! To whom shall I tell all this? Who will 










understand me?" "Pain", he consoled them again, "is unavoidable as long as there is a body. The 










Lord takes on the body for the sake of His devotees." 



















Yet one is not sure whether the Master's soul actually was tortured by this agonizing 










disease. At least during his moments of spiritual exaltation - which became almost constant during 










the closing days of his life on earth -he lost all consciousness of the body, of illness and suffering. 










One of his attendants said later on: "While Sri Ramakrishna lay sick he never actually suffered pain. 










He would often say: '0 mind! Forget the body, forget the sickness, and remain merged in Bliss.' No, 










he did not really suffer. At times, he would be in a state when the thrill of joy was clearly 










manifested in his body. Even when he could not speak he would let us know in some way that 










there was no suffering, and this fact was clearly evident to all who watched him. People who did 










not understand him thought that his suffering was very great. What spiritual joy he transmitted to 










us at that time! Could such a thing have been possible if he had been suffering physically? It was 










during this period that he taught us again these truths. 'Brahman is always unattached. The three 










gunas are in It, but It is unaffected by them, just as the wind carries odour yet remains odourless.' 










'Brahman is Infinite Being, In finite Wisdom, Infinite Bliss. In It there exist no delusion, no misery, 










no disease, no death, no growth, no decay.' 'The Transcendental Being and the being within are 










one and the same. There is one indivisible Absolute Existence.' " 



















The Holy Mother secretly went to a Siva temple across the Ganges to intercede with the 










Deity for the Master's recovery. In a revelation she was told to prepare herself for the inevitable 










end. 



















One day when Narendra was on the ground floor, meditating, the Master was lying awake 










in his bed upstairs. In the depths of his meditation Narendra felt as though a lamp were burning at 










the back of his head. Suddenly he lost consciousness. It was the yearned-for, all-effacing 





































experience of nirvikalpa Samadhi, when the embodied soul realizes its unity with the Absolute. 










After a very long time he regained partial consciousness but was unable to find his body. He could 










see only his head. "Where is my body?" he cried. The elder Gopal entered the room and said, 










"Why, it is here, Naren!" But Narendra could not find it. Gopal, frightened, ran upstairs to the 










Master. Sri Ramakrishna only said: "Let him stay that way for a time. He has worried me long 










enough." 



















After another long period Narendra regained full consciousness. Bathed in peace, he went 










to the Master, who said: "Now the Mother has shown you everything. But this revelation will 










remain under lock and key, and I shall keep the key. When you have accomplished the Mother's 










work you will find the treasure again." 



















Some days later, Narendra being alone with the Master, Sri Ramakrishna looked at him and 










went into Samadhi. Narendra felt the penetration of a subtle force and lost all outer 










consciousness. Regaining presently the normal mood, he found the Master weeping. 



















Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "Today I have given you my all and I am now only a poor fakir, 










possessing nothing. By this power you will do immense good in the world, and not until it is 










accomplished will you return." Henceforth the Master lived in the disciple. 



















Doubt, however, dies hard. After one or two days Narendra said to himself, "If in the midst 










of this racking physical pain he declares his Godhead, then only shall I accept him as an Incarnation 










of God." He was alone by the bedside of the Master. It was a passing thought, but the Master 










smiled. Gathering his remaining strength, he distinctly said, "He who was Rama and Krishna is now, 










in this body, Ramakrishna - but not in your Vedantic sense." Narendra was stricken with shame. 



















mahA-samAdhi 



















Sunday, August 15, 1886. The Master's pulse became irregular. The devotees stood by the 










bedside. Toward dusk Sri Ramakrishna had difficulty in breathing. A short time afterwards he 










complained of hunger. A little liquid food was put into his mouth; some of it he swallowed, and the 










rest ran over his chin. Two attendants began to fan him. All at once he went into Samadhi of a 










rather unusual type. The body became stiff. Sasi burst into tears. But after midnight the Master 










revived. He was now very hungry and helped himself to a bowl of porridge. He said he was strong 










again. He sat up against five or six pillows, which were supported by the body of Sashi, who was 










fanning him. Narendra took his feet on his lap and began to rub them. Again and again, the Master 










repeated to him, "Take care of these boys." Then, he asked to lie down. Three times in ringing 










tones he cried the name of Kali, his life's Beloved, and lay back. At two minutes past one there was 










a low sound in his throat and he fell a little to one side. A thrill passed over h is body. His hair stood 










on end. His eyes became fixed on the tip of his nose. His face was lighted with a smile. The final 










ecstasy began. It was Maha-samadhi, total absorption, from which his mind never returned. 










Narendra, unable to bear it, ran downstairs. 



















Dr. Sarkar arrived the following noon and pronounced that life had departed not more than 










half an hour before. At five o'clock the Master's body was brought downstairs, laid on a cot, 










dressed in ochre clothes, and decorated with sandal-past and flowers. A procession was formed. 





































The passers-by wept as the body was taken to the cremation ground at the Baranagore Ghat on 










the Ganges. 



















While the devotees were returning to the garden house, carrying the urn with the sacred 










ashes, a calm resignation came to their souls and they cried, "Victory unto the Guru!" 



















The Holy Mother was weeping in her room, not for her husband, but because she felt that 










Mother Kali had left her. As she was about to put off the marks of a Hindu widow, in a moment of 










revelation she heard the words of faith "I have only passed from one room to another." 



















MASTER AND DISCIPLE 



















February 1882 



















M.'S FIRST VISIT TO THE MASTER 



















IT WAS ON A SUNDAY in spring, a few days after Sri Ramakrishna's birthday, that M. met 










him the first time. Sri Ramakrishna lived at the Kailibari, the temple garden of Mother Kali, on the 










bank of the Ganges at Dakshineswar. 



















M., being at leisure on Sundays, had gone with his friend Sidhu to visit several gardens at 










Baranagore. As they were walking in Prasanna Bannerji's garden, Sidhu said: "There is a charming 










place on the bank of the Ganges where a paramahamsa lives. Should you like to go there?" M. 










assented and they started immediately for the Dakshineswar temple garden. They arrived at the 










main gate at dusk and went straight to Sri Ramakrishna's room. And there they found him seated 










on a wooden couch, facing the east. With a smile on his face he was talking of God. The room 










was full of people, all seated on the floor, drinking in his words in deep silence. 



















M. stood there speechless and looked on. It was as if he were standing where all the holy 










places met and as if Sukadeva himself were speaking the word of God, or as if Sri Chaitanya were 










singing the name and glories of the Lord in Puri with Ramananda, Swarup, and the other devotees. 



















FORMALITIES AND ESSENTIALS OF RELIGION 



















Sri Ramakrishna said: "When, hearing the name of Hari or Rama once, you shed tears and 










your hair stands on end, then you may know for certain that you do not have to perform such 










devotions as the sandhya any more. Then only will you have a right to renounce rituals; or rather, 










rituals will drop away of themselves. Then it will be enough if you repeat only the name of Rama or 










Hari, or even simply Om." Continuing, he said, "The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, and the Gayatri 










merges in Om." 



















M. looked around him with wonder and said to himself: "What a beautiful place! What a 










charming man! How beautiful his words are! I have no wish to move from this spot." After a few 










minutes he thought, "Let me see the place first; then I'll come back here and sit down." 



















As he left the room with Sidhu, he heard the sweet music of the evening service arising in 










the temple from gong, bell, drum, and cymbal. He could hear music from the nahabat, too, at the 










south end of the garden. The sounds travelled over the Ganges, floating away and losing 





































themselves in the distance. A soft spring wind was blowing, laden with the fragrance of flowers; 










the moon had just appeared. It was as if nature and man together were preparing for the 










evening worship. M. and Sidhu visited the twelve 



















Siva temples, the Radhakanta temple, and the temple of Bhavatarini. And as M. watched 










the services before the images his heart was filled with joy. 



















On the way back to Sri Ramakrishna's room the two friends talked. Sidhu told M. that the 










temple garden had been founded by Rani Rasmani. He said that God was worshipped there daily 










as Kali, Krishna, and Siva, and that within the gates sadhus and beggars were fed. When they 










reached Sri Ramakrishna's door again, they found it shut, and Brinde, the Maid, standing outside. 










M., who had been trained in English manners and would not enter a room without permission, 










asked her, "Is the holy man in?" Brinde replied, "Yes he's in the room." 



















M: "How long has he lived here?" 



















BRINDE: "Oh, he has been here a long time." 



















M: "Does he read many books?" 



















BRINDE: "Books? Oh, dear no! They're all on his tongue." 



















M. had just finished his studies in college. It amazed him to hear that Sri Ramakrishna 










read no books. 



















M: "Perhaps it is time for his evening worship. May we go into the room? Will you tell him 










we are anxious to see him?" 



















BRINDE: "Go right in, children. Go in and sit down." 



















Entering the room, they found Sri Ramakrishna alone, seated on the wooden couch. Incense 










had just been burnt and all the doors were shut. As he entered, M. with folded hands saluted the 










Master. Then, at the Master's bidding, he and Sidhu sat on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna asked them: 










"Where do you live? What is your occupation? Why have you come to Baranagore?" M. answered 










the questions, but he noticed that now and then the Master seemed to become absent-minded. 










Later he learnt that this mood is called bhava, ecstasy. It is like the state of the angler who has 










been sitting with his rod: the fish comes and swallows the bait, and the float begins to tremble; the 










angler is on the alert; he grips the rod and watches the float steadily and eagerly; he will not speak 










to anyone. Such was the state of Sri Ramakrishna's mind. Later M. heard, and himself noticed, that 










Sri Ramakrishna would often go into this mood after dusk, sometimes becoming totally 










unconscious of the outer world. 



















M: "Perhaps you want to perform your evening worship. In that case may we take our 










leave?" 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA (still in ecstasy): "No-evening worship? No, it is not exactly that." 



















After a little conversation M. saluted the Master and took his leave. "Come again", Sri 










Ramakrishna said. 





































On his way home M. began to wonder: "Who is this serene-looking man who is drawing me 










back to him? Is it possible for a man to be great without being a scholar? How wonderful it is! I 










should like to see him again. He himself said, 'Come again.' I shall go tomorrow or the day after." 



















SECOND VISIT 



















M.'s second visit to Sri Ramakrishna took place on the southeast verandah at eight o'clock in 










the morning. The Master was about to be shaved, the barber having just arrived. As the cold 










season still lingered he had put on a moleskin shawl bordered with red. Seeing M., the Master 










said: "So you have come. That's good. Sit down here." He was smiling. He stammered a little when 










he spoke. 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA (to M.): "Where do you live?" 










M: "In Calcutta, sir." 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA: "Where are you staying here?" 



















M: "I am at Baranagore at my older sister's-lshan Kaviraj's house." 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA: "Oh, at Ishan's? Well, how is Keshab now? He was very ill." 



















M: "Indeed, I have heard so too, but I believe he is well now." 



















MASTER'S LOVE FOR KESHAB 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA: "I made a vow to worship the Mother with green coconut and sugar on 










Keshab's recovery. Sometimes, in the early hours of the morning, I would wake up and cry before 










Her: 'Mother, please make Keshab well again. If Keshab doesn't live, whom shall I talk with when I 










go to Calcutta?' And so it was that I resolved to offer Her the green coconut and sugar. 



















"Tell me, do you know of a certain Mr. Cook who has come to Calcutta? Is it true that he is 










giving lectures? Once Keshab took me on a steamer, and this Mr. Cook, too was in the party." 



















M: "Yes, sir, I have heard something like that; but I have never been to his lectures. I don't 










know much about him." 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA ON M.'S MARRIAGE 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA: "Pratap's brother came here. He stayed a few days. He had nothing to 










do and said he wanted to live here. I came to know that he had left his wife and children with his 










father-in-law. He has a whole brood of them! So I took him to task. Just fancy! He is the father of 










so many children! Will people from the neighbourhood feed them and bring them up? He isn't 










even ashamed that someone else is feeding his wife and children, and that they have been left at 










his father-in-law's house. I scolded him very hard and asked him to look for a job. Then he was 










willing to leave here. 



















"Are you married?" 





































M: "Yes, sir." SRI RAMAKRISHNA (with a shudder): "Oh, Ramlal! Alas, he is married!" Like 










one guilty of a terrible offence, M. sat motionless, his eyes fixed on the ground. He thought, "Is it 










such a wicked thing to get married?" The Master continued, "Have you any children?" 



















M. this time could hear the beating of his own heart. He whispered in a trembling voice, 










"Yes, sir, I have children." 



















Very sadly Sri Ramakrishna said, "Ah me! He even has children!" 



















Thus rebuked M. sat speechless. His pride had received a blow. After a few minutes Sri 










Ramakrishna looked at him kindly and said affectionately: "You see, you have certain good signs. 










I know them by looking at a person's forehead, his eyes, and so on. Tell me, now, what kind of 










person is your wife? Has she spiritual attributes, or is she under the power of avidya?" 



















"She is all right. But I am afraid she is ignorant." MASTER (with evident displeasure): "And 










you are a man of knowledge!" I had yet to learn the distinction between knowledge and ignorance. 










Up to this time his conception had been that one got knowledge from books and schools. Later on 










he gave up this false conception. He was taught that to know God is knowledge, and not to know 










Him, ignorance. When Sri Ramakrishna exclaimed, "And you are a man of knowledge!", M.'s ego 










was again badly shocked. 



















GOD WITH AND WITHOUT FORM 



















MASTER: "Well, do you believe in God with form or without form?" 



















M., rather surprised, said to himself: "How can one believe in God without form when one 










believes in God with form? And if one believes in God without form, how can one believe that God 










has a form? Can these two contradictory ideas be true at the same time? Can a white liquid like 










milk be black?" 



















M: "Sir, I like to think of God as formless." 



















MASTER: "Very good. It is enough to have faith in either aspect. You believe in God without 










form; that is quite all right. But never for a moment think that this alone is true and all else false. 










Remember that God with form is just as true as God without form. But hold fast to your own 










conviction." 



















The assertion that both are equally true amazed M.; he had never learnt this from his 










books. Thus his ego received a third blow; but since it was not yet completely crushed, he came 










forward to argue with the Master a little more. 



















GOD AND THE CLAY IMAGE 



















M: "Sir, suppose one believes in God with form. Certainly He is not the clay image!" 



















MASTER (interrupting): "But why clay? It is an image of Spirit." 



















M. could not quite understand the significance of this "image of Spirit". "But, sir," he said to 










the Master, "one should explain to those who worship the clay image that it is not God, and that, 





































while worshipping it, they should have God in view and not the clay image. One should not 










worship clay." 



















GOD THE ONLY REAL TEACHER 



















MASTER (sharply): "That's the one hobby of you Calcutta people - giving lectures and 










bringing others to the light! Nobody ever stops to consider how to get the light himself. Who are 










you to teach others? 



















"He who is the Lord of the Universe will teach everyone. He alone teaches us, who has 










created this universe; who has made the sun and moon, men and beasts, and all other beings; who 










has provided means for their sustenance; who has given children parents and endowed them with 










love to bring them up. The Lord has done so many things - will He not show people the way to 










worship Him? If they need teaching, then He will be the Teacher. He is our Inner Guide. 



















"Suppose there is an error in worshipping the clay image; doesn't God know that through it 










He alone is being invoked? He will he pleased with that very worship. Why should you get a 










headache over it? You had better try for knowledge and devotion yourself." 



















This time M. felt that his ego was completely crushed. He now said to himself: "Yes, he has 










spoken the truth. What need is there for me to teach others? Have I known God? Do I really love 










Him? 'I haven't room enough for myself in my bed, and I am inviting my friend to share it with me!' 










I know nothing about God, yet I am trying to teach others. What a shame! How foolish I am! This is 










not mathematics or history or literature, that one can teach it to others. No, this is the deep 










mystery of God. What he says appeals to me." 



















This was M.'s first argument with the Master, and happily his last. 



















MASTER: "You were talking of worshipping the clay image. Even if the image is made of clay, 










there is need for that sort of worship. God Himself has provided different forms of worship. He 










who is the Lord of the Universe has arranged all these forms to suit different men in different 










stages of knowledge. 



















"The mother cooks different dishes to suit the stomachs of her different children. Suppose 










she has five children. If there is a fish to cook, she prepares various dishes from it - pilau, pickled 










fish, fried fish, and so on - to suit their different tastes and powers of digestion. 



















"Do you understand me?" 



















NEED OF HOLY COMPANY & MEDITATION IN SOLITUDE 



















M. (humbly): "Yes, sir. How, sir, may we fix our minds on God?" 



















MASTER: "Repeat God's name and sing His glories, and keep holy company; and now and 










then visit God's devotees and holy men. The mind cannot dwell on God if it is immersed day and 










night in worldliness, in worldly duties and responsibilities; it is most necessary to go into solitude 










now and then and think of God. To fix the mind on God is very difficult, in the beginning, unless 





































one practises meditation in solitude. When a tree is young it should be fenced all around; 










otherwise it may be destroyed by cattle. 



















"To meditate, you should withdraw within yourself or retire to a secluded corner or to the 










forest. And you should always discriminate between the Real and the unreal. God alone is real, the 










Eternal Substance; all else is unreal, that is, impermanent. By discriminating thus, one should 










shake off impermanent objects from the mind." 



















GOD AND WORLDLY DUTIES 



















M. (humbly):"How ought we to live in the world?" 



















MASTER: "Do all your duties, but keep your mind on God. Live with all - with wife and 










children, father and mother - and serve them. Treat them as if they were very dear to you, but 










know in your heart of hearts that they do not belong to you. 



















"A maidservant in the house of a rich man performs all the household duties, but her 










thoughts are fixed on her own home in her native village. She brings up her Master's children as if 










they were her own. She even speaks of them as 'my Rama' or 'my Hari'. But in her own mind she 










knows very well that they do not belong to her at all. 



















"The tortoise moves about in the water. But can you guess where her thoughts are? There 










on the bank, where her eggs are lying. Do all your duties in the world, but keep your mind on God. 



















"If you enter the world without first cultivating love for God, you will be entangled more 










and more. You will be overwhelmed with its danger, its grief, its sorrows. And the more you think 










of worldly things, the more you will be attached to them. 



















"First rub your hands with oil and then break open the jack-fruit; otherwise they will be 










smeared with its sticky milk. First secure the oil of divine love, and then set your hands to the 










duties of the world. 



















"But one must go into solitude to attain this divine love. To get butter from milk you must 










let it set into curd in a secluded spot; if it is too much disturbed, milk won't turn into curd. Next, 










you must put aside all other duties, sit in a quiet spot, and churn the curd. Only then do you get 










butter. 



















"Further, by meditating on God in solitude the mind acquires knowledge, dispassion, and 










devotion. But the very same mind goes downward if it dwells in the world. In the world there is 










only one thought: 'woman and gold'. 



















"The world is water and the mind milk. If you pour milk into water they become one; you 










cannot find the pure milk any more. But turn the milk into curd and churn it into butter. Then, 










when that butter is placed in water, it will float. So, practise spiritual discipline in solitude and 










obtain the butter of knowledge and love. Even if you keep that butter in the water of the world the 










two will not mix. The butter will float. 





































PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATION 



















"Together with this, you must practise discrimination. 'Woman and gold' is impermanent. 










God is the only Eternal Substance. What does a man get with money? Food, clothes, and a 










dwelling-place - nothing more. You cannot realize God with its help. Therefore money can never 










be the goal of life. That is the process of discrimination. Do you understand?" 



















M: "Yes, sir. I recently read a Sanskrit play called Prabodha Chandrodaya. It deals with 










discrimination." 



















MASTER: "Yes, discrimination about objects. Consider - what is there in money or in a 










beautiful body? Discriminate and you will find that even the body of a beautiful woman consists of 










bones, flesh, fat, and other disagreeable things. Why should a man give up God and direct his 










attention to such things? Why should a man forget God for their sake?" 



















HOW TO SEE GOD 



















M: "Is it possible to see God?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, certainly. Living in solitude now and then, repeating God's name and singing 










His glories, and discriminating between the Real and the unreal - these are the means to employ to 










see Him." 



















LONGING AND YEARNING 



















M: "Under what conditions does one see God?" 



















MASTER: "Cry to the Lord with an intensely yearning heart and you will certainly see Him. 










People shed a whole jug of tears for wife and children. They swim in tears for money. But who 










weeps for God? Cry to Him with a real cry." 



















The Master sang: 



















Cry to your Mother Syama , with a real cry, mind! And how can She hold Herself from 










you? How can Syama stay away? How can your Mother Kali hold Herself away? 



















mind, if you are in earnest, bring Her an offering Of bel-leaves and hibiscus flowers; Lay at 










Her feet your offering And with it mingle the fragrant sandal-paste of Love. 



















Continuing, he said: "Longing is like the rosy dawn. After the dawn out comes the sun. 










Longing is followed by the vision of God. 



















"God reveals Himself to a devotee who feels drawn to Him by the combined force of these 










three attractions: the attraction of worldly possessions for the worldly man, the child's attraction 










for its mother, and the husband's attraction for the chaste wife. If one feels drawn to Him by the 










combined force of these three attractions, then through it one can attain Him. 



















"The point is, to love God even as the mother loves her child, the chaste wife her husband, 










and the worldly man his wealth. Add together these three forces of love, these three powers of 










attraction, and give it all to God. Then you will certainly see Him. 





































"It is necessary to pray to Him with a longing heart. The kitten knows only how to call its 










mother, crying, 'Mew, mew!' It remains satisfied wherever its mother puts it. And the mother cat 










puts the kitten sometimes in the kitchen, sometimes on the floor, and sometimes on the bed. 










When it suffers it cries only, 'Mew, mew!' That's all it knows. But as soon as the mother hears this 










cry, wherever she may be; she comes to the kitten." 



















THIRD VISIT 



















It was Sunday afternoon when M. came on his third visit to the Master. He had been 










profoundly impressed by his first two visits to this wonderful man. He had been thinking of the 










Master constantly, and of the utterly simple way he explained the deep truths of the spiritual life. 










Never before had he met such a man. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch. The room was filled with devotees,3 who 










had taken advantage of the holiday to come to see the Master. M. had not yet become acquainted 










with any of them; so he took his seat in a corner. The Master smiled as he talked with the 










devotees. 



















NARENDRA 



















He addressed his words particularly to a young man of nineteen, named Narendranath, who 










was a college student and frequented the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. His eyes were bright, his words 










were full of spirit, and he had the look of a lover of God. 



















HOW THE SPIRITUALLY MINDED SHOULD LOOK UPON THE WORLDLY 



















M. guessed that the conversation was about worldly men, who look down on those who 










aspire to spiritual things. The Master was talking about the great number of such people in the 










world, and about how to deal with them. 



















MASTER (to Narendra): "How do you feel about it? Worldly people say all kinds of things 










about the spiritually minded. But look here! When an elephant moves along the street, any 










number of curs and other small animals may bark and cry after it; but the elephant doesn't even 










look back at them. If people speak ill of you, what will you think of them?" 



















NARENDRA: "I shall think that dogs are barking at me." 










GOD IN EVERY BEING 



















MASTER (Smiling): "Oh, no! You mustn't go that far, my child! (Laughter). God dwells in all 










beings. But you may be intimate only with good people; you must keep away from the 










evil-minded. God is even in the tiger; but you cannot embrace the tiger on that account. 










(Laughter). You may say, 'Why run away from a tiger, which is also a manifestation of God?' The 










answer to that is: 'Those who tell you to run away are also manifestations of God - and why 










shouldn't you listen to them?' 





































PARABLE OF THE "ELEPHANT GOD" 



















"Let me tell you a story. In a forest there lived a holy man who had many disciples. One day 










he taught them to see God in all beings and, knowing this, to bow low before them all. A disciple 










went to the forest to gather wood for the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he heard an outcry: 'Get out of 










the way! A mad elephant is coming!' All but the disciple of the holy man took to their heels. He 










reasoned that the elephant was also God in another form. Then why should he run away from it? 










He stood still, bowed before the animal, and began to sing its praises. The mahut of the elephant 










was shouting: 'Run away! Run away!' But the disciple didn't move. The animal seized him with its 










trunk, cast him to one side, and went on its way. Hurt and bruised, the disciple lay unconscious on 










the ground. Hearing what had happened, his teacher and his brother disciples came to him and 










carried him to the hermitage. With the help of some medicine he soon regained consciousness. 










Someone asked him, 'You knew the elephant was coming - why didn't you leave the place?' 'But', 










he said, 'our teacher has told us that God Himself has taken all these forms, of animals as well as 










men. Therefore, thinking it was only the elephant God that was coming, I didn't run away.' At this 










the teacher said: 'Yes, my child, it is true that the elephant God was coming; but the mahut God 










forbade you to stay there. Since all are manifestations of God, why didn't you trust the mahut's 










words? You should have heeded the words of the mahut God.' (Laughter) 



















"It is said in the scriptures that water is a form of God. But some water is fit to be used for 










worship, some water for washing the face, and some only for washing plates or dirty linen. This 










last sort cannot be used for drinking or for a holy purpose. In like manner, God undoubtedly dwells 










in the hearts of all - holy and unholy, righteous and unrighteous; but a man should not have 










dealings with the unholy, the wicked, the impure. He must not be intimate with them. With 










some of them he may exchange words, but with others he shouldn't go even that far. He should 










keep aloof from such people." 



















HOW TO DEAL WITH THE WICKED 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, if a wicked man is about to do harm, or actually does so, should we keep 










quiet then?" 



















MASTER: "A man living in society should make a show of tamas to protect himself from 










evil-minded people. But he should not harm anybody in anticipation of harm likely to be done him. 



















PARABLE OF THE SNAKE 



















"Listen to a story. Some cowherd boys used to tend their cows in a meadow where a 










terrible poisonous snake lived. Everyone was on the alert for fear of it. One day a brahmachari was 










going along the meadow. The boys ran to him and said: 'Revered sir, please don't go that way. A 










venomous snake lives over there.' 'What of it, my good children?' said the brahmachari. 'I am not 










afraid of the snake. I know some mantras.' So saying, he continued on his way along the meadow. 










But the cowherd boys, being afraid, did not accompany him. In the mean time the snake moved 










swiftly toward him with upraised hood. As soon as it came near, he recited a mantra, and the 










snake lay at his feet like an earthworm. The brahmachari said: 'Look here. Why do you go about 










doing harm? Come, I will give you a holy word. By repeating it you will learn to love God. 










Ultimately you will realize Him and so get rid of your violent nature.' Saying this, he taught the 





































snake a holy word and initiated him into spiritual life. The snake bowed before the teacher and 










said, 'Revered sir, how shall I practise spiritual discipline?' 'Repeat that sacred word', said the 










teacher, 'and do no harm to anybody'. As he was about to depart, the brahmachari said, 'I shall see 










you again.' 



















"Some days passed and the cowherd boys noticed that the snake would not bite. They 










threw stones at it. Still it showed no anger; it behaved as if it were an earthworm. One day one of 










the boys came close to it, caught it by the tail, and, whirling it round and round, dashed it again 










and again on the ground and threw it away. The snake vomited blood and became unconscious. It 










was stunned. It could not move. So, thinking it dead, the boys went their way. 



















"Late at night the snake regained consciousness. Slowly and with great difficulty it dragged 










itself into its hole; its bones were broken and it could scarcely move. Many days passed. The snake 










became a mere skeleton covered with a skin. Now and then, at night, it would come out in search 










of food. For fear of the boys it would not leave its hole during the day-time. Since receiving the 










sacred word from the teacher, it had given up doing harm to others. It maintained its life on dirt, 










leaves, or the fruit that dropped from the trees. 



















"About a year later the brahmachari came that way again and asked after the snake. The 










cowherd boys told him that it was dead. But he couldn't believe them. He knew that the snake 










would not die before attaining the fruit of the holy word with which it had been initiated. He found 










his way to the place and, searching here and there, called it by the name he had given it. Hearing 










the teacher's voice, it came out of its hole and bowed before him with great reverence. 'How are 










you?' asked the brahmachari. 'I am well, sir', replied the snake. 'But', the teacher asked, 'why are 










you so thin?' The snake replied: 'Revered sir, you ordered me not to harm any body. So I have 










been living only on leaves and fruit. Perhaps that has made me thinner.' 



















"The snake had developed the quality of sattva; it could not be angry with anyone. It had 










totally forgotten that the cowherd boys had almost killed it. 



















"The brahmachari said: 'It can't be mere want of food that has reduced you to this state. 










There must be some other reason. Think a little.' Then the snake remembered that the boys had 










dashed it against the ground. It said: 'Yes, revered sir, now I remember. The boys one day dashed 










me violently against the ground. They are ignorant, after all. They didn't realize what a great 










change had come over my mind. How could they know I wouldn't bite or harm anyone?' The 










brahmachari exclaimed: 'What a shame! You are such a fool! You don't know how to protect 










yourself. I asked you not to bite, but I didn't forbid you to hiss. Why didn't you scare them by 










hissing?' 



















"So you must hiss at wicked people. You must frighten them lest they should do you harm. 










But never inject your venom into them. One must not injure others. 



















"In this creation of God there is a variety of things: men, animals, trees, plants. Among the 










animals some are good, some bad. There are ferocious animals like the tiger. Some trees bea r fruit 










sweet as nectar, and others bear fruit that is poisonous. Likewise, among human beings, there are 





































the good and the wicked, the holy and the unholy. There are some who are devoted to God, and 










others who are attached to the world. 



















FOUR CLASSES OF MEN 



















"Men may be divided into four classes: those bound by the fetters of the world, the seekers 










after liberation, the liberated, and the ever-free. 



















"Among the ever-free we may count sages like Narada. They live in the world for the good 










of others, to teach men spiritual truth. 



















"Those in bondage are sunk in worldliness and forgetful of God. Not even by mistake do 










they think of God. 



















"The seekers after liberation want to free themselves from attachment to the world. Some 










of them succeed and others do not. 



















"The liberated souls, such as the sadhus and mahatmas, are not entangled in the world, in 










'woman and gold'. Their minds are free from worldliness. Besides, they always meditate on the 










Lotus Feet of God. 



















"Suppose a net has been cast into a lake to catch fish. Some fish are so clever that they are 










never caught in the net. They are like the ever-free. But most of the fish are entangled in the net. 










Some of them try to free themselves from it, and they are like those who seek liberation. But not 










all the fish that struggle succeed. A very few do jump out of the net, making a big splash in the 










water. Then the fishermen shout, 'Look! There goes a big one!' But most of the fish caught in the 










net cannot escape, nor do they make any effort to get out. On the contrary, they burrow into the 










mud with the net in their mouths and lie there quietly, thinking, 'We need not fear any more; we 










are quite safe here.' But the poor things do not know that the fishermen will drag them out with 










the net. These are like the men bound to the world. 



















"The bound souls are tied to the world by the fetters of 'woman and gold'. They are bound 










hand and foot. Thinking that 'woman and gold' will make them happy and give them security, they 










do not realize that it will lead them to annihilation. When a man thus bound to the world is about 










to die, his wife asks, 'You are about to go; but what have you done for me?' Again, such is his 










attachment to the things of the world that, when he sees the lamp burning brightly, he says: 'Dim 










the light. Too much oil is being used.' And he is on his death-bed! 



















"The bound souls never think of God. If they get any leisure they indulge in idle gossip and 










foolish talk, or they engage in fruitless work. If you ask one of them the reason, he answers, 'Oh, I 










cannot keep still; so I am making a hedge.' When time hangs heavy on their hands they perhaps 










start playing cards." 



















There was deep silence in the room. 



















REDEEMING POWER OF FAITH 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, is there no help, then, for such a worldly person?" 





































MASTER: "Certainly there is. From time to time he should live in the company of holy men, 










and from time to time go into solitude to meditate on God. Furthermore, he should practise 










discrimination and pray to God, 'Give me faith and devotion.' Once a person has faith he has 










achieved everything. There is nothing greater than faith. 



















(To Kedar) "You must have heard about the tremendous power of faith. It is said in the 










purana that Rama, who was God Himself - the embodiment of Absolute Brahman - had to build a 










bridge to cross the sea to Ceylon. But Hanuman, trusting in Rama's name, cleared the sea in one 










jump and reached the other side. He had no need of a bridge. (All laugh) 



















"Once a man was about to cross the sea. Bibhishana wrote Rama's name on a leaf, tied it in 










a corner of the man's wearing-cloth, and said to him: 'Don't be afraid. Have faith and walk on the 










water. But look here - the moment you lose faith you will be drowned.' The man was walking easily 










on the water. Suddenly he had an intense desire to see what was tied in his cloth. He opened it 










and found only a leaf with the name of Rama written on it. 'What is this?' he thought. 'Just the 










name of Rama!' As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the water. 



















"If a man has faith in God, then even if he has committed the most heinous sins -such as 










killing a cow, a brahmin, or a woman - he will certainly be saved through his faith. Let him only say 










to God, '0 Lord, I Will not repeat such an action', and he need not be afraid of anything." 



















When he had said this, the Master sang: 



















If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name, How canst Thou then, Blessed One, 










Withhold from me deliverance, Wretched though I may be? 1 may have stolen a drink of wine, or 










killed a child unborn, Or slain a woman or a cow, Or even caused a brahmin's death; But, though it 










all be true, Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness; For through the power of Thy 










sweet name My wretched soul may still aspire Even to Brahmanhood. 



















PARABLE OF THE HOMA BIRD 



















Pointing to Narendra, the Master said: "You all see this boy. He behaves that way here. A 










naughty boy seems very gentle when with his father. But he is quite another person when he plays 










in the chandni. Narendra and people of his type belong to the class of the ever-free. They are 










never entangled in the world. When they grow a little older they feel the awakening of inner 










consciousness and go directly toward God. They come to the world only to teach others. They 










never care for anything of the world. They are never attached to 'woman and gold'. 



















"The Vedas speak of the homa bird. It lives high up in the sky and there it lays its egg. As 










soon as the egg is laid it begins to fall; but it is so high up that it continues to fall for many days. As 










it falls it hatches, and the chick falls. As the chick falls its eyes open; it grows wings. As soon as its 










eyes open, it realizes that it is falling and will be dashed to pieces on touching the earth. Then it at 










once shoots up toward the mother bird high in the sky." 



















At this point Narendra left the room. Kedar, Prankrishna, M., and many others remained. 





































MASTER PRAISES NARENDRA 





































MASTER: "You see, Narendra excels in singing, playing on instruments, study, and 










everything. The other day he had a discussion with Kedar and tore his arguments to shreds. (All 










laugh.) 



















(To M.) "Is there any book in English on reasoning?" 










M: "Yes, sir, there is. It is called Logic." 










MASTER: "Tell me what it says." 



















M. was a little embarrassed. He said: "One part of the book deals with deduction from the 










general to the particular. For example: All men are mortal. Scholars are men. Therefore scholars 










are mortal. Another part deals with the method of reasoning from the particular to the general. 










For example: This crow is black. That crow is black. The crows we see everywhere are black. 










Therefore all crows are black. But there may be a fallacy in a conclusion arrived at in this way; for 










on inquiry one may find a white crow in some country. There is another illustration: If there is rain, 










there is, or has been, a cloud. Therefore rain comes from a cloud. Still another example: This man 










has thirty-two teeth. That man has thirty-two teeth. All the men we see have thirty-two teeth. 










Therefore men have thirty-two teeth. English logic deals with such inductions and deductions." 



















Sri Ramakrishna barely heard these words. While listening he became absent-minded. So 










the conversation did not proceed far. 



















When the meeting broke up, the devotees sauntered in the temple garden. M. went in the 










direction of the Panchavati. It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. After a while he returned to 










the Master's room. There, on the small north verandah, he witnessed an amazing sight. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was standing still, surrounded by a few devotees, and Narendra was 










singing. M. had never heard anyone except the Master sing so sweetly. When he looked at Sri 










Ramakrishna he was struck with wonder; for the Master stood motionless, with eyes transfixed. 










He seemed not even to breathe. A devotee told M. that the Master was in samadhi. M. had never 










before seen or heard of such a thing. Silent with wonder, he thought: "Is it possible for a man to be 










so oblivious of the outer world in the consciousness of God? How deep his faith and devotion must 










be to bring about such a state!" 



















Narendra was singing: 



















Meditate, my mind, on the Lord Hari, The Stainless One, Pure Spirit through and through. 










How peerless is the Light that in Him shines! How soul-bewitching is His wondrous form! How dear 










is He to all His devotees! 



















Ever more beauteous in fresh-blossoming love That shames the splendour of a million 










moons, Like lightning gleams the glory of His form, Raising erect the hair for very joy. 



















The Master shuddered when this last line was sung. His hair stood on end, and tears of joy 










streamed down his cheeks. Now and then his lips parted in a smile. Was he seeing the peerless 










beauty of God, "that shames the splendour of a million moons"? Was this the vision of God, the 





































Essence of Spirit? How much austerity and discipline, how much faith and devotion, must be 










necessary for such a vision! 



















The song went on: 



















Worship His feet in the lotus of your heart; with mind serene and eyes made radiant with 










heavenly love, behold that matchless sight. 



















Again that bewitching smile. The body motionless as before, the eyes half shut, as if 










beholding a strange inner vision. 



















The song drew to a close. Narendra sang the last lines: 



















Caught in the spell of His love's ecstasy, Immerse yourself for evermore, mind" In Him 










who is Pure Knowledge and Pure Bliss. 



















The sight of the samadhi, and the divine bliss he had witnessed, left an indelible impression 










on M.'s mind. He returned home deeply moved. Now and then he could hear within himself the 










echo of those soul-intoxicating lines: 



















Immerse yourself for evermore, mind, In Him who is Pure Knowledge and Pure Bliss. 










FOURTH VISIT 



















The next day, too, was a holiday for M. He arrived at Dakshineswar at three o'clock in the 










afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was in his room; Narendra, Bhavanath, and a few other devotees 










were sitting on a mat spread on the floor. They were all young men of nineteen or twenty. 










Seated on the small couch, Sri Ramakrishna was talking with them and smiling. 



















No sooner had M. entered the room than the Master laughed aloud and said to the boys, 










"There! He has come again." They all joined in the laughter. M. bowed low before him and took a 










seat. Before this he had saluted the Master with folded hands, like one with an English 










education. But that day he learnt to fall down at his feet in orthodox Hindu fashion. 



















THE PEACOCK AND THE OPIUM 



















Presently the Master explained the cause of his laughter to the devotees, He said: "A man 










once fed a peacock with a pill of opium at four o'clock in the afternoon. The next day, exactly at 










that time, the peacock came back. It had felt the intoxication of the drug and returned just in time 










to have another dose. "(All laugh.) 



















M. thought this a very apt illustration. Even at home he had been unable to banish the 










thought of Sri Ramakrishna for a moment. His mind was constantly at Dakshineswar and he had 










counted the minutes until he should go again. 



















In the mean time the Master was having great fun with the boys, treating them as if they 










were his most intimate friends. Peals of side-splitting laughter filled the room, as if it were a mart 










of joy. The whole thing was a revelation to M. He thought: "Didn't I see him only yesterday 










intoxicated with God? Wasn't he swimming then in the Ocean of Divine Love - a sight I had never 





































seen before? And today the same person is behaving like an ordinary man! Wasn't it he who 










scolded me on the first day of my coming here? Didn't he admonish me, saying, 'And you are a 










man of knowledge!'? Wasn't it he who said to me that God with form is as true as God without 










form? Didn't he tell me that God alone is real and all else illusory? Wasn't it he who advised me to 










live in the world unattached, like a maidservant in a rich man's house?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna was having great fun with the young devotees; now and then he glanced at 










M. He noticed that M. sat in silence. The Master said to Ramlal: "You see, he is a little advanced in 










years, and therefore somewhat serious. He sits quiet while the youngsters are making merry." M. 










was then about twenty-eight years old. 



















HANUMAN'S DEVOTION TO RAMA 



















The conversation drifted to Hanuman, whose picture hung on the wall in the Master's 



















room. 



















Sri Ramakrishna said: "Just imagine Hanuman's state of mind. He didn't care for money, 










honour, creature comforts, or anything else. He longed only for God. When he was running away 










with the heavenly weapon that had been secreted in the crystal pillar, Mandodari began to tempt 










him with various fruits so that he might come down and drop the weapon. But he couldn't be 










tricked so easily. In reply to her persuasions he sang this song: 



















Am I in need of fruit? I have the Fruit that makes this life Fruitful indeed. Within my heart 



















The Tree of Rama grows, Bearing salvation for its fruit. 



















Under the Wish-fulfilling Tree Of Rama do I sit at ease, Plucking whatever fruit I will. But if 










you speak of fruit No beggar, I, for common fruit. Behold, I go, Leaving a bitter fruit for you." 



















As Sri Ramakrishna was singing the song he went into samadhi. Again the half-closed eyes 










and motionless body that one sees in his photograph. Just a minute before, the devotees had been 










making merry in his company. Now all eyes were riveted on him. Thus for the second time M. saw 










the Master in samadhi. 



















After a long time the Master came back to ordinary consciousness. His face lighted up with 










a smile, and his body relaxed; his senses began to function in a normal way. He shed tears of joy as 










he repeated the holy name of Rama. M. wondered whether this very saint was the person who a 










few minutes earlier had been behaving like a child of five. 



















The Master said to Narendra and M., "I should like to hear you speak and argue in English." 










They both laughed. But they continued to talk in their mother tongue. It was impossible for M. to 










argue any more before the Master. Though Ramakrishna insisted, they did not talk in English. 



















At five o'clock in the afternoon all the devotees except Narendra and M. took leave of the 










Master. As M. was walking in the temple garden, he suddenly came upon the Master talking to 










Narendra on the bank of the goose-pond. Sri Ramakrishna said to Narendra: "Look here. Come a 










little more often. You are a new-comer. On first acquaintance people visit each other quite often, 





































as is the case with a lover and his sweetheart. (Narendra and M. laugh.) So please come, won't 










you?" 



















Narendra, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, was very particular about his promises. He said 










with a smile, "Yes, sir, I shall try." 



















As they were returning to the Master's room, Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "When peasants 










go to market to buy bullocks for their ploughs, they can easily tell the good from the bad by 










touching their tails. On being touched there, some meekly lie down on the ground. The peasants 










recognize that these are without mettle and so reject them. They select only those bullocks that 










frisk about and show spirit when their tails are touched. Narendra is like a bullock of this latter 










class. He is full of spirit within." 



















The Master smiled as he said this, and continued: "There are some people who have no grit 










whatever. They are like flattened rice soaked in milk - soft and mushy. No inner strength!" 



















It was dusk. The Master was meditating on God. He said to M.: "Go and talk to Narendra. 










Then tell me what you think of him." 



















Evening worship was over in the temples. M. met Narendra on the bank of the Ganges and 










they began to converse. Narendra told M. about his studying in college, his being a member of the 










Brahmo Samaj, and so on. 



















It was now late in the evening and time for M.'s departure; but he felt reluctant to go and 










instead went in search of Sri Ramakrishna. He had been fascinated by the Master's singing and 










wanted to hear more. At last he found the Master pacing alone in the natmandir in front of the 










Kali temple. A lamp was burning in the temple on either side of the image of the Divine Mother. 










The single lamp in the spacious natmandir blended light and darkness into a kind of mystic twilight, 










in which the figure of the Master could be dimly seen. 



















M. had been enchanted by the Master's sweet music. With some hesitation he asked him 










whether there would be any more singing that evening. "No, not tonight", said Sri Ramakrishna 










after a little reflection. Then, as if remembering something, he added: "But I'm going soon to 










Balaram Bose's house in Calcutta. Come there and you'll hear me sing." M. agreed to go. 



















MASTER: "Do you know Balaram Bose?" 



















M: "No, sir. I don't." 



















MASTER: "He lives in Bosepara." 



















M: "Well, sir, I shall find him." 



















As Sri Ramakrishna walked up and down the hall with M., he said to him: "Let me ask you 










something. What do you think of me?" 



















M. remained silent. Again Sri Ramakrishna asked: "What do you think of me? How many 










annas of knowledge of God have I?" 





































M: "I don't understand what you mean by 'annas'. But of this I am sure: I have never before 










seen such knowledge, ecstatic love, faith in God, renunciation, and catholicity anywhere." 



















The Master laughed. 



















M. bowed low before him and took his leave. He had gone as far as the main gate of the 










temple garden when he suddenly remembered something and came back to Sri Ramakrishna, who 










was still in the natmandir. In the dim light the Master, all alone, was pacing the hall, rejoicing in 










the Self as the lion lives and roams alone in the forest. 



















In silent wonder M. surveyed that great soul. 



















MASTER (to M.): "What makes you come back?" 



















M: "Perhaps the house you asked me to go to belongs to a rich man. They may not let me 










in. I think I had better not go. I would rather meet you here." 



















MASTER: "Oh, no! Why should you think that? Just mention my name. Say that you want to 










see me; then someone will take you to me." 



















M. nodded his assent and, after saluting the Master, took his leave. 



















IN THE COMPANY OF DEVOTEES 



















March 11, 1882 



















Master at Balaram's house 



















ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK in the morning Sri Ramakrishna went as planned to Balaram Bose's 










house in Calcutta. It was the day of the Dolayatra. Ram, Manomohan, Rakhal, Nityagopal, and 










other devotees were with him. M., too, came, as bidden by the Master. 



















DEVOTEES IN TRANCE 



















The devotees and the Master sang and danced in a state of divine fervour. Several of them 










were in an ecstatic mood. Nityagopal's chest glowed with the upsurge of emotion, and Rakhal lay 










on the floor in ecstasy, completely unconscious of the world. The Master put his hand on Rakhal's 










chest and said: "Peace. Be quiet." This was Rakhal's first experience of ecstasy. He lived with his 










father in Calcutta and now and then visited the Master at Dakshineswar. About this time he had 










studied a short while in Vidyasagar's school at Syampukur. 



















When the music was over, the devotees sat down for their meal. Balaram stood there 










humbly, like a servant. Nobody would have taken him for the master of the house. M. was still a 










stranger to the devotees, having met only Narendra at Dakshineswar. 



















A few days later M. visited the Master at Dakshineswar. It was between four and five 










o'clock in the afternoon. The Master and he were sitting on the steps of the Siva temples. Looking 










at the temple of Radhakanta, across the courtyard, the Master went into an ecstatic mood. 





































Since his nephew Hriday's dismissal from the temple, Sri Ramakrishna had been living 










without an attendant. On account of his frequent spiritual moods he could hardly take care of 










himself. The lack of an attendant caused him great inconvenience. 



















BIGOTRY CONDEMNED 



















Sri Ramakrishna was talking to Kali, the Divine Mother of the Universe. He said: "Mother, 










everyone says, 'My watch alone is right.' The Christians, the Brahmos, the Hindus, the 










Mussalmans, all say, 'My religion alone is true.' But, Mother, the fact is that nobody's watch is 










right. Who can truly understand Thee? But if a man prays to Thee with a yearning heart, he can 










reach Thee, through Thy grace, by any path. Mother, show me some time how the Christians pray 










to Thee in their churches. But Mother, what will people say if I go in? Suppose they make a fuss! 










Suppose they don't allow me to enter the Kali temple again! Well then, show me the Christian 










worship from the door of the church." 



















THE MIND'S INABILITY TO COMPREHEND GOD 



















Another day the Master was seated on the small couch in his room, with his usual beaming 










countenance. M. arrived with Kalikrishna, who did not know where his friend M. was taking him. 










He had only been told: "If you want to see a grog-shop, then come with me. You will see a huge jar 










of wine there." M. related this to Sri Ramakrishna, who laughed about it. The Master said: "The 










bliss of worship and communion with God is the true wine, the wine of ecstatic love. The goal of 










human life is to love God, Bhakti is the one essential thing. To know God through jnana and 










reasoning is extremely difficult." 



















Then the Master sang: 



















Who is there that can understand what Mother Kali is? Even the six darsanas are powerless 










to reveal Her.... 



















The Master said, again: "The one goal of life is to cultivate love for God, the love that the 










milkmaids, the milkmen, and the cowherd boys of Vrindavan felt for Krishna. When Krishna went 










away to Mathura, the cowherds roamed about weeping bitterly because of their separation from 










Him." 



















Saying this the Master sang, with his eyes turned upward: 



















Just now I saw a youthful cowherd With a young calf in his arms; There he stood, by one 










hand holding The branch of a young tree. "Where are You, Brother Kanai?" he cried; But "Kanai" 










scarcely could he utter; "Ka" was as much as he could say. He cried, "Where are You, Brother?" 










And his eyes were filled with tears. 



















When M. heard this song of the Master's, laden with love, his eyes were moist with tears. 



















April 2, 1882 Master's visit to Keshab 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in the drawing-room of Keshab Chandra Sen's house in Calcutta; 










it was five o'clock in the afternoon. When Keshab was told of his arrival, he came to the 





































drawing-room dressed to go out, for he was about to call on a sick friend. Now he cancelled his 










plan. The Master said to him: "You have so many things to attend to. Besides, you have to edit a 










newspaper. You have no time to come to Dakshineswar; so I have come to see you. When I heard 










of your illness I vowed green coconut and sugar to the Divine Mother for your recovery. I said to 










Her, 'Mother, if something happens to Keshab, with whom shall I talk in Calcutta?' " 



















Sri Ramakrishna spoke to Pratap and the other Brahmo devotees. M. was seated near by. 










Pointing to him, the Master said to Keshab: "Will you please ask him why he doesn't come to 










Dakshineswar any more? He repeatedly tells me he is not attached to his wife and children." M. 










had been paying visits to the Master for about a month; his absence for a time from Dakshineswar 










called forth this remark. Sri Ramakrishna had asked M. to write to him, if his coming were delayed. 



















Pundit Samadhyayi was present. The Brahmo devotees introduced him to Sri Ramakrishna 










as a scholar well versed in the Vedas and the other scriptures. The Master said, "Yes, I can see 










inside him through his eyes, as one can see the objects in a room through the glass door." 



















Trailokya sang. Suddenly the Master stood up and went into samadhi, repeating the 










Mother's name. Coming down a little to the plane of sense consciousness, he danced and sang: 



















I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss, as I repeat my Mother Kali's name; It 










so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk! First my guru gives molasses for the 










making of the Wine; My longing is the ferment to transform it. Knowledge, the maker of the Wine, 










prepares it for me then; And when it is done, my mind imbibes it from the bottle of the mantra, 










Taking the Mother's name to make it pure. Drink of this Wine, says Ramprasad, and the four fruits 










of life are yours. 



















The Master looked at Keshab tenderly, as if Keshab were his very own. He seemed to fear 










that Keshab might belong to someone else, that is to say, that he might become a worldly person. 










Looking at him, the Master sang again: 



















We are afraid to speak, and yet we are afraid to keep still; Our minds, Radha, half believe 










that we are about to lose you! We tell you the secret that we know -The secret whereby we 










ourselves, and others, with our help, Have passed through many a time of peril; Now it all depends 










on you. 



















Quoting the last part of the song, he said to Keshab: "That is to say, renounce everything 










and call on God. He alone is real; all else is illusory. Without the realization of God everything is 










futile. This is the great secret." 



















The Master sat down again and began to converse with the devotees. For a while he 










listened to a piano recital, enjoying it like a child. Then he was taken to the inner apartments, 










where he was served with refreshments and the ladies saluted him. 



















As the Master was leaving Keshab's house, the Brahmo devotees accompanied him 










respectfully to his carriage. 





































Sunday, April 9, 1882 





































Sri Ramakrishna was seated with his devotees in the drawing-room of Prankrishna 










Mukherji's house in Calcutta; it was between one and two o'clock in the afternoon. Since 



















Colonel Viswanath4 lived in that neighbourhood, the Master intended to visit him before 










going to see Keshab at the Lily Cottage. A number of neighbours and other friends of Prankrishna 










had been invited to meet Sri Ramakrishna. They were all eager to hear his words. 



















GOD AND HIS GLORY & DANGERS OF WORLDLY LIFE 



















MASTER: "God and His glory. This universe is His glory. People see His glory and forget 










everything. They do not seek God, whose glory is this world. All seek to enjoy 'woman and gold'. 










But there is too much misery and worry in that. This world is like the whirlpool of the Visalaksi. 










Once a boat gets into it there is no hope of its rescue. Again, the world is like a thorny bush: you 










have hardly freed yourself from one set of thorns before you find yourself entangled in another. 










Once you enter a labyrinth you find it very difficult to get out. Living in the world, a man becomes 










seared, as it were." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Then what is the way, sir?" 



















Prayer and holy company & Earnest longing 



















MASTER: "Prayer and the company of holy men. You cannot get rid of an ailment without 










the help of a physician. But it is not enough to be in the company of religious people only for a day. 










You should constantly seek it, for the disease has become chronic. Again, you can't understand the 










pulse rightly unless you live with a physician. Moving with him constantly, you learn to distinguish 










between the pulse of phlegm and the pulse of bile." 



















DEVOTEE: "What is the good of holy company?" 



















MASTER: "It begets yearning for God. It begets love of God. Nothing whatsoever is achieved 










in spiritual life without yearning. By constant living in the company of holy men, the soul becomes 










restless for God. This yearning is like the state of mind of a man who has someone ill in the family. 










His mind is in a state of perpetual restlessness, thinking how the sick person may be cured. Or 










again, one should feel a yearning for God like the yearning of a man who has lost his job and is 










wandering from one office to another in search of work. If he is rejected at a certain place which 










has no vacancy, he goes there again the next day and inquires, 'Is there an vacancy today?' 



















"There is another way: earnestly praying to God. God is our very own. We should say to 










Him: '0 God, what is Thy nature? Reveal Thyself to me. Thou must show Thyself to me; for why 










else hast Thou created me?' Some Sikh devotees once said to me, 'God is full of compassion.' I 










said: 'But why should we call Him compassionate? He is our Creator. What is there to be wondered 










at if He is kind to us? Parents bring up their children. Do you call that an act of kindness? They 










must act that way.' Therefore we should force our demands on God. He is our Father and Mother, 










isn't He? If the son demands his patrimony and gives up food and drink in order to enforce his 










demand, then the parents hand his share over to him three years before the legal time. Or when 










the child demands some pice from his mother, and says over and over again: 'Mother, give me a 





































couple of pice. I beg you on my knees!' - then the mother, seeing his earnestness, and unable to 










bear it any more, tosses the money to him. 



















"There is another benefit from holy company. It helps one cultivate discrimination between 










the Real and the unreal. God alone is the Real, that is to say, the Eternal Substance, and the world 










is unreal, that is to say, transitory. As soon as a man finds his mind wandering away to the unreal, 










he should apply discrimination. The moment an elephant stretches out its trunk to eat a 










plantain-tree in a neighbour's garden, it gets a blow from the iron goad of the driver." 



















EXPLANATION OF EVIL 



















A NEIGHBOUR: "Why does a man have sinful tendencies?" 



















MASTER: "In God's creation there are all sorts of things. He has created bad men as well as 










good men. It is He who gives us good tendencies, and it is He again who gives us evil tendencies." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "In that case we aren't responsible for our sinful actions, are we?" 



















MASTER: "Sin begets its own result. This is God's law. Won't you burn our tongue if you 










chew a chilli? In his youth Mathur6 led a rather fast life; so he suffered from various diseases 










before his death. 



















"One may not realize this in youth. I have looked into the hearth in the kitchen of the Kali 










temple when logs are being burnt. At first the wet wood burns rather well. It doesn't seem then 










that it contains much moisture. But when the wood is sufficiently burnt, all the moisture runs back 










to one end. At last water squirts from the fuel and puts out the fire. 



















"So one should be careful about anger, passion, and greed. Take, for instance, the case of 










Hanuman. In a fit of anger he burnt Ceylon. At last he remembered that Sita was living in the asoka 










grove. Then he began to tremble lest the fire should injure her." 



















NEIGHHBOUR: "Why has God created wicked people?" 



















MASTER: "That is His will, His play. In His maya there exists avidya as well as vidya. Darkness 










is needed too. It reveals all the more the glory of light. There is no doubt that anger, lust, and 










greed are evils. Why, then, has God created them? In order to create saints. A man becomes a 










saint by conquering the senses. Is there anything impossible for a man who has subdued his 










passions? He can even realize God, through His grace. Again, see how His whole play of creation is 










perpetuated through lust. 



















"Wicked people are needed too. At one time the tenants of an estate became unruly. The 










landlord had to send Golak Choudhury, who was a ruffian. He was such a harsh administrator that 










the tenants trembled at the very mention of his name. 



















"There is need of everything. Once Sita said to her Husband: 'Rama, it would be grand if 










every house in Ayhodhya were a mansion! I find many houses old and dilapidated.' 'But, my dear,' 










said Rama, 'if all the houses were beautiful ones, what would the masons do?' (Laughter.) God has 










created all kinds of things. He has created good trees, and poisonous plants and weeds as well. 





































Among the animals there are good, bad, and all kinds of creatures - tigers, lions, snakes, and so 










on." 



















WASHING AWAY THE HEART S IMPURITIES WITH TEARS 



















NEIGHTBOUR: "Sir, is it ever possible to realize God while leading the life of a householder?" 



















MASTER: "Certainly. But as I said just now, one must live in holy company and pray 










unceasingly. One should weep for God. When the impurities of the mind are thus washed away, 










one realizes God. The mind is like a needle covered with mud, and God is like a magnet. The 










needle cannot be united with the magnet unless it is free from mud. Tears wash away the mud, 










which is nothing but lust, anger, greed, and other evil tendencies, and the inclination to worldly 










enjoyments as well. As soon as the mud is washed away, the magnet attracts the needle, that is to 










say, man realizes God. Only the pure in heart see God. A fever patient has an excess of the watery 










element in his system. What can quinine do for him unless that is removed? 



















"Why shouldn't one realize God while living in the world? But, as I said, one must live in holy 










company, pray to God, weeping for His grace, and now and then go into solitude. Unless the plants 










on a foot-path are protected at first by fences, they are destroyed by cattle." 



















NEED OF A GURU 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Then householders, too, will have the vision of God, won't they?" 



















MASTER: "Everybody will surely be liberated. But one should follow the instructions of the 










guru; if one follows a devious path, one will suffer in trying to retrace one's steps. It takes a long 










time to achieve liberation. A man may fail to obtain it in this life. Perhaps he will realize God only 










after many births. Sages like Janaka performed worldly duties. They performed them, bearing God 










in their minds, as a dancing-girl dances, keeping jars or trays on her head. Haven't you seen how 










the women in northwest India walk, talking and laughing while carrying water-pitchers on their 










beads?" 



















NEIGHBOUR: "You just referred to the instructions of the guru. How shall we find him?" 



















MASTER: "Anyone and everyone cannot be a guru. A huge timber floats on the water and 










can carry animals as well. But a piece of worthless wood sinks, if a man sits on it, and drowns him. 










Therefore in every age God incarnates Himself as the guru, to teach humanity. Satchidananda 










alone is the guru. 



















"What is knowledge? And what is the nature of this ego? 'God alone is the Doer, and none 










else' - that is knowledge. I am not the doer; I am a mere instrument in His hand. Therefore I say: '0 










Mother, Thou art the Operator and I am the machine. Thou art the Indweller and I am the house. 










Thou art the Driver and I am the carriage. I move as Thou movest me. I do as Thou makest me do. I 










speak as Thou makest me speak. Not I, not I, but Thou, but Thou.' " 



















From Prankrishna's house the Master went to Colonel Viswanath's and from there to the

VISIT TO VIDYASAGAR 



















August 5, 1882 



















PUNDIT ISWAR CHANDRA VIDYASAGAR was born in the village of Beersingh, not far from 










Kamarpukur, Sri Ramakrishna's birthplace. He was known as a great scholar, educator, writer, and 










philanthropist. One of the creators of modern Bengali, he was also well versed in Sanskrit grammar 










and poetry. His generosity made his name a household word with his countrymen, most of his 










income being given in charity to widows, orphans, indigent students, and other needy people. Nor 










was his compassion limited to human beings: he stopped drinking milk for years so that the calves 










should not be deprived of it, and he would not drive in a carriage for fear of causing discomfort to 










the horses. He was a man of indomitable spirit, which he showed when he gave up the lucrative 










position of principal of the Sanskrit College of Calcutta because of a disagreement with the 










authorities. His affection for his mother was especially deep. One day, in the absence of a 










ferryboat, he swam a raging river at the risk of his life to fulfil her wish that he should be present at 










his brother's wedding. His whole life was one of utter simplicity. The title Vidyasagar, meaning 










"Ocean of Learning", was given him in recognition of his vast erudition. 



















Master's visit to the scholar 



















Sri Ramakrishna had long wanted to visit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar. Learning from M. that 










he was a teacher at Vidyasagar's school, the Master asked: "Can you take me to Vidyasagar? I 










should like very much to see him." M. told Iswar Chandra of Sri Ramakrishna's wish, and the pundit 










gladly agreed that M. should bring the Master, some Saturday afternoon at four o'clock. He only 










asked M. what kind of paramahamsa the Master was, saying, "Does he wear an ochre cloth?" M. 










answered: "No, sir. He is an unusual person. He wears a red-bordered cloth and polished slippers. 










He lives in a room in Rani Rasmani's temple garden. In his room there is a couch with a mattress 










and mosquito net. He has no outer indication of holiness. But he doesn't know anything except 










God. Day and night he thinks of God alone." 



















On the afternoon of August 5 the Master left Dakshineswar in a hackney carriage, 










accompanied by Bhavanath, M., and Hazra. Vidyasagar lived in Badurbagan, in central Calcutta, 










about six miles from Dakshineswar. On the way Sri Ramakrishna talked with his companions; but 










as the carriage neared Vidyasagar's house his mood suddenly changed. He was overpowered with 










divine ecstasy. Not noticing this, M. pointed out the garden house where Raja Rammohan Roy had 










lived. The Master was annoyed and said, "I don't care about such things now." He was going into 










an ecstatic state. 



















The carriage stopped in front of. Vidyasagar's house. The Master alighted, supported by M., 










who then led the way. In the courtyard were many flowering plants. As the Master walked to the 










house he said to M., like a child, pointing to his shirt-button: "My shirt is unbuttoned. Will that 










offend Vidyasagar?" "Oh, no!" said M. "Don't be anxious about it. 



















Nothing about you will be offensive. You don't have to button your shirt." He accepted the 










assurance simply, like a child. 





































Vidyasagar was about sixty-two years old, sixteen or seventeen years older than the Master. 










He lived in a two-storey house built in the English fashion, with lawns on all sides and surrounded 










by a high wall. After climbing the stairs to the second floor, Sri Ramakrishna and his devotees 










entered a room at the far end of which Vidyasagar was seated facing them, with a table in front of 










him. To the right of the table was a bench. Some friends of their host occupied chairs on the other 










two sides. 



















Vidyasagar rose to receive the Master. Sri Ramakrishna stood in front of the bench, with 










one hand resting on the table. He gazed at Vidyasagar, as if they had known each other before, 










and smiled in an ecstatic mood. In that mood he remained standing a few minutes. Now and then, 










to bring his mind back to normal consciousness, he said, "I shall have a drink of water." 



















In the mean time the young members of the household and a few friends and relatives of 










Vidyasagar had gathered around. Sri Ramakrishna, still in an ecstatic mood, sat on the bench. A 










young man, seventeen or eighteen years old, who had come to Vidyasagar to seek financial help 










for his education, was seated there. The Master sat down at a little distance from the boy, saying 










in an abstracted mood: "Mother, this boy is very much attached to the world. He belongs to Thy 










realm of ignorance." 



















Vidyasagar told someone to bring water and asked M. whether the Master would like some 










sweetmeats also. Since M. did not object, Vidyasagar himself went eagerly to the inner apartments 










and brought the sweets. They were placed before the Master. Bhavanath and Hazra also received 










their share. When they were offered to M., Vidyasagar said: "Oh, he is like one of the family. We 










needn't worry about him." Referring to a young devotee, the Master said to Vidyasagar: "He is a 










nice young man and is sound at the core. He is like the river Phalgu. The surface is covered with 










sand; but if you dig a little you will find water flowing underneath." 



















After taking some of the sweets, the Master, with a smile, began to speak to Vidyasagar. 










Meanwhile the room had become filled with people; some were standing and others were seated. 



















MASTER: "Ah! Today, at last, I have come to the ocean. Up till now I have seen only canals, 










marshes, or a river at the most. But today I am face to face with the sagar, the ocean. "(All laugh.) 



















VIDYASAGAR (smiling): "Then please take home some salt water." (Laughter.) 



















MASTER: "Oh, no! Why salt water? You aren't the ocean of ignorance. You are the ocean of 










vidya, knowledge. You are the ocean of condensed milk." (All laugh.) 



















VIDYASAGAR: "Well, you may put it that way." 



















The pundit became silent. Sri Ramakrishna said: "Your activities are inspired by sattva. 










Though they are rajasic, they are influenced by sattva. Compassion springs from sattva. Though 










work for the good of others belongs to rajas, yet this rajas has sattva for its basis, and is not 










harmful. Shuka and other sages cherished compassion in their minds to give people religious 










instruction, to teach them about God. You are distributing food and learning. That is good too. If 










these activities are done in a selfless spirit they lead to God. But most people work for fame or to 










acquire merit. Their activities are not selfless. Besides, you are already a siddha." 





































VIDYASAGAR: "How is that, sir?" 



















MASTER (laughing): "When potatoes and other vegetables are well cooked, they become 










soft and tender. And you possess such a tender nature! You are so compassionate!" (Laughter.) 



















VIDYASAGAR (laughing): "But when the paste of kalai pulse is boiled it becomes all the 










harder." 



















UNINSPIRED SCHOLARSHIP CONDEMNED 



















MASTER: "But you don't belong to that class. Mere pundits are like diseased fruit that 










becomes hard and will not ripen at all. Such fruit has neither the freshness of green fruit nor the 










flavour of ripe. Vultures soar very high in the sky, but their eyes are fixed on rotten carrion on the 










ground. The book-learned are reputed to be wise, but they are attached to 'woman and gold'. 










Like the vultures, they are in search of carrion. They are attached to the world of ignorance. 










Compassion, love of God, and renunciation are the glories of true knowledge." 



















Vidyasagar listened to these words in silence. The others, too, gazed at the Master and 










were attentive to every word he said. 



















Vidyasagar was very reticent about giving religious instruction to others. He had studied 










Hindu philosophy. Once, when M. had asked him his opinion of it, Vidyasagar had said, "I think the 










philosophers have failed to explain what was in their minds." But in his daily life he followed all the 










rituals of Hindu religion and wore the sacred thread of a brahmin. About God he had once 










declared: "It is indeed impossible to know Him. What, then, should be our duty? It seems to me 










that we should live in such a way that, if others followed our example, this very earth would be 










heaven. Everyone should try to do good to the world." 



















THE WORLD OF DUALITY & TRANSCENDENTAL NATURE OF BRAHMAN 



















Sri Ramakrishna's conversation now turned to the Knowledge of Brahman. 



















MASTER: "Brahman is beyond vidya and avidya, knowledge and ignorance. It is beyond 










maya, the illusion of duality. 



















"The world consists of the illusory duality of knowledge and ignorance. It contains 










knowledge and devotion, and also attachment to 'Woman and gold'; righteousness and 










unrighteousness; good and evil. But Brahman is unattached to these. Good and evil apply to the 










jiva, the individual soul, as do righteousness and unrighteousness; but Brahman is not at all 










affected by them. 



















"One man may read the Bhagavata by the light of a lamp, and another may commit a 










forgery by that very light; but the lamp is unaffected. The sun sheds its light on the wicked as well 










as on the virtuous. 



















"You may ask, 'How, then, can one explain misery and sin and unhappiness?' The answer is 










that these apply only to the jiva. Brahman is unaffected by them. There is poison in a snake; but 










though others may die if bitten by it, the snake itself is not affected by the poison. 





































BRAHMAN CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS 



















"What Brahman is cannot he described. All thi ngs in the world - the Vedas, the Puranas, the 










Tantras, the six systems of philosophy - have been defiled, like food that has been touched by the 










tongue, for they have been read or uttered by the tongue. Only one thing has not been defiled in 










this way, and that is Brahman. No one has ever been able to say what Brahman is." 



















VIDYASAGAR (to his friends): "Oh! That is a remarkable statement. I have learnt something 










new today." 



















MASTER: "A man had two sons. The father sent them to a preceptor to learn the Knowledge 










of Brahman. After a few years they returned from their preceptor's house and bowed low before 










their father. Wanting to measure the depth of their knowledge of Brahman, he first questioned 










the older of the two boys. 'My child,' he said, 'You have studied all the scriptures. Now tell me, 










what is the nature of Brahman?' The boy began to explain Brahman by reciting various texts from 










the Vedas. The father did not say anything. Then he asked the younger son the same question. 










But the boy remained silent and stood with eyes cast down. No word escaped his lips. The father 










was pleased and said to him: 'My child, you have understood a little of Brahman. What It is cannot 










be expressed in words.' 



















PARABLE OF ANT AND SUGAR HILL 



















"Men often think they have understood Brahman fully. Once an ant went to a hill of sugar. 










One grain filled its stomach. Taking another grain in its mouth it started homeward. On its way it 










thought, 'Next time I shall carry home the whole hill.' That is the way shallow minds think. They 










don't know that Brahman is beyond one's words and thought. However great a man may be, how 










much can he know of Brahman? Sukadeva and sages like him may have been big ants; but even 










they could carry at the utmost eight or ten grains of sugar! 



















"As for what has been said in the Vedas and the Puranas, do you know what it is like? 










Suppose a man has seen the ocean, and somebody asks him, 'Well, what is the ocean like?' The 










first man opens his mouth as wide as he can and says: 'What a sight! What tremendous waves and 










sounds!' The description of Brahman in the sacred books is like that. It is said in the Vedas that 










Brahman is of the nature of Bliss - It is Satchidananda. 



















"Shuka and other sages stood on the shore of this Ocean of Brahman and saw and touched 










the water. According to one school of thought they never plunged into it. Those who do, cannot 










come back to the world again. 



















PARABLE OF SALT DOLL 



















"In samadhi one attains the Knowledge of Brahman - one realizes Brahman. In that state 










reasoning stops altogether, and man becomes mute. He has no power to describe the nature of 










Brahman. 



















"Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. (All laugh.) It wanted to tell 










others how deep the water was. But this it could never do, for no sooner did it get into the water 










than it melted. Now who was there to report the ocean's depth?" 





































A DEVOTEE: "Suppose a man has obtained the Knowledge of Brahman in samadhi. Doesn't 










he speak any more?" 



















MASTER: "Sankaracharya retained the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach others. After the 










vision of Brahman a man becomes silent. He reasons about It as long as he has not realized It. If 










you heat butter in a pan on the stove, it makes a sizzling sound as long as the water it contains has 










not dried up. But when no trace of water is left the clarified butter makes no sound. If you put an 










uncooked cake of flour in that butter it sizzles again. But after the cake is cooked all sound stops. 










Just so, a man established in samadhi comes down to the relative plane of consciousness in order 










to teach others, and then he talks about God. 



















"The bee buzzes as long as it is not sitting on a flower. It becomes silent when it begins to 










sip the honey. But sometimes, intoxicated with the honey, it buzzes again. 



















"An empty pitcher makes a gurgling sound when it is dipped in water. When it fills up it 










becomes silent. (All laugh.) But if the water is poured from it into another pitcher, then you will 










hear the sound again. (Laughter.) 



















RISHIS OF ANCIENT INDIA 



















"The rishis of old attained the Knowledge of Brahman. One cannot have this so long as 










there is the slightest trace of worldliness. How hard the rishis laboured! Early in the morning they 










would go away from the hermitage, and would spend the whole day in solitude, meditating on 










Brahman. At night they would return to the hermitage and eat a little fruit or roots. They kept their 










minds aloof from the objects of sight, hearing, touch, and other things of a worldly nature. Only 










thus did they realize Brahman as their own inner consciousness. 



















"But in the Kaliyuga, man, being totally dependent on food for life, cannot altogether shake 










off the idea that he is the body. In this state of mind it is not proper for him to say, 'I am He.' 










When a man does all sorts of worldly things, he should not say, 'I am Brahman.' Those who cannot 










give up attachment to worldly things, and who find no means to shake off the feeling of T, should 










rather cherish the idea 'I am God's servant; I am His devotee.' One can also realize God by 










following the path of devotion. 



















JNANI AND VIJNANI 



















"The jnani gives up his identification with worldly things, discriminating, 'Not this, not this'. 










Only then can he realize Brahman. It is like reaching the roof of a house by leaving the steps 










behind, one by one. But the vijnani, who is more intimately acquainted with Brahman, realizes 










something more. He realizes that the steps are made of the same materials as the roof: bricks, 










lime, and brick-dust. That which is realized intuitively as Brahman, through the eliminating process 










of 'Not this, not this', is then found to have become the universe and all its living beings. The 










vijnani sees that the Reality which is nirguna, without attributes, is also saguna, with attributes. 



















"A man cannot live on the roof a long time. He comes down again. Those who realize 










Brahman in samadhi come down also and find that it is Brahman that has become the universe 










and its living beings. In the musical scale there are the notes sa, re ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni; but one 





































cannot keep one's voice on 'ni' a long time. The ego does not vanish altogether. The man coming 










down from samadhi perceives that it is Brahman that has become the ego, the universe, and all 










living beings. This is known as vijnana. 



















PATH OF LOVE IS EASY 



















"The path of knowledge leads to Truth, as does the path that combines knowledge and love. 










The path of love, too, leads to this goal. The way of love is as true as the way of knowledge. All 










paths ultimately lead to the same Truth. But as long as God keeps the feeling of ego in us, it is 










easier to follow the path of love. 



















"The vijnani sees that Brahman is immovable and actionless, like Mount Sumeru. This 










universe consists of the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas. They are in Brahman. But Brahman 










is unattached. 



















GOD'S SUPERNATURAL POWERS 



















"The vijnani further sees that what is Brahman is the Bhagavan, the Personal God. He who is 










beyond the three gunas is the Bhagavan, with His six supernatural powers. Living beings, the 










universe, mind, intelligence, love, renunciation, knowledge - all these are the manifestations of His 










power. (With a laugh) If an aristocrat has neither house nor property, or if he has been forced to 










sell them, one doesn't call him an aristocrat any more. (All laugh.) God is endowed with the six 










supernatural powers. If He were not who would obey Him? (All laugh.) 



















DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF GOD S POWER 



















"Just see how picturesque this universe is! How many things there are! The sun, moon, and 










stars; and how many varieties of living beings! - big and small, good and bad, strong and weak - 










some endowed with more power some with less." 



















VIDYASAGAR: "Has He endowed some with more power and others with less?" 



















MASTER: "As the All-pervading Spirit He exists in all beings, even in the ant. But the 










manifestations of His Power are different in different beings; otherwise, how can one person put 










ten to flight, while another can't face even one? And why do all people respect you? Have you 










grown a pair horns? (Laughter.) You have more compassion and learning. Therefore people honour 










you and come to pay you their respects. Don't you agree with me?" 



















Vidyasagar smiled. 



















The Master continued: "There is nothing in mere scholarship. The object of study is to find 










means of knowing God and realizing Him. A holy man had a book. When asked what it contained, 










he opened it and showed that on all the pages were written the words 'Om Rama', and nothing 










else. 



















"What is the significance of the Gita? It is what you find by repeating the word ten times. It 










is then reversed into 'tagi', which means a person who has renounced everything for God. And the 





































lesson of the Gita is: '0 man, renounce everything and seek God alone.' Whether a man is a monk 










or a householder, he has to shake off all attachment from his mind. 



















"Chaitanyadeva set out on a pilgrimage to southern India. One day he saw a man reading 










the Gita. Another man, seated at a distance, was listening and weeping. His eyes were swimming 










in tears. Chaitanyadeva asked him, 'Do you understand all this?' The man said, 'No, revered sir, I 










don't understand a word of the text.' 'Then why are you crying?' asked Chaitanya. The devotee 










said: 'I see Arjuna's chariot before me. I see Lord Krishna and Arjuna seated in front of it, talking. 










I see this and I weep.' 



















"Why does a vijnani keep an attitude of love toward God? The answer is that 'I- 










consciousness' persists. It disappears in the state of samadhi, no doubt, but it comes back. In the 










case of ordinary people the T never disappears. You may cut down the Aswattha tree, but the next 










day sprouts shoot up. (All laugh.) 



















EGO CAUSES OUR SUFFERINGS 



















"Even after the attainment of Knowledge this 'l-consciousness' comes up, nobody knows 










from where. You dream of a tiger. Then you awake; but your heart keeps on palpitating! All our 










suffering is due to this T. The cow cries, 'Hamba!', which means T. That is why it suffers so much. 










It is yoked to the plough and made to work in rain and sun. Then it may be killed by the butcher. 










From its hide shoes are made, and also drums, which are mercilessly, beaten. (Laughter.) Still it 










does not escape suffering. At last strings are made out of its entrails for the bows used in carding 










cotton. Then it no longer says, 'Hamba! Hamba!', 'I! I!' but 'Tuhu! Tuhu!', 'Thou! Thou!'. Only then 










are its troubles over. Lord, I am the servant; Thou art the Master. I am the child; Thou art the 










Mother. 



















"Once Rama asked Hanuman, 'How do you look on Me?' And Hanuman replied: '0 Rama, as 










long as I have the feeling of "I", I see that Thou art the whole and I am a part; Thou art the Master 










and I am Thy servant. But when, Rama, I have the knowledge of Truth, then I realize that Thou 










art I and I am Thou.' 



















"The relationship of master and servant is the proper one. Since this T must remain, let the 










rascal be God's servant. 



















EVIL OF "I" AND "MINE" 



















"T and 'mine' - these constitute ignorance. 'My house', 'my wealth', 'my learning', 'my 










possessions' - the attitude that prompts one to say such things comes of ignorance. On the 










contrary, the attitude born of Knowledge is: '0 God, Thou art the Master, and all these things 










belong to Thee. House, family, children, attendants, friends, are Thine.' 



















"One should constantly remember death. Nothing will survive death. We are born into this 










world to perform certain duties, like the people who come from the countryside to Calcutta on 










business. If a visitor goes to a rich man's garden, the superintendent says to him, 'This is our 










garden', 'This is our lake', and so forth. But if the Superintendent is dismissed for some misdeed, 





































he can't carry away even his mango-wood chest. He sends it secretly by the gate-keeper. 










(Laughter.) 



















"God laughs on two occasions. He laughs when the physician says to the patient's mother, 










'Don't be afraid, mother; I shall certainly cure your boy.' God laughs, saying to Himself, 'I am going 










to take his life, and this man says he will save it!' The physician thinks he is the master, forgetting 










that God is the Master. God laughs again when two brothers divide their land with a string, saying 










to each other, 'This side is mine and that side is your'. He laughs and says to Himself, 'The whole 










universe belongs to Me, but they say they own this portion or that portion.' 



















"Can one know God through reasoning? Be His servant, surrender yourself to Him, and then 










pray to Him. 



















(To Vidyasagar, with a smile) "Well, what is your attitude?" 










VIDYASAGAR (smiling): "Some day I shall confide it to you. "(All laugh) 










MASTER (laughing): "God cannot be realized through mere scholarly reasoning." 










Intoxicated with divine love, the Master sang: 



















Who is there that can understand what Mother Kali is? Even the six darsanas are powerless 










to reveal Her. It is She, the scriptures say, that is the Inner Self of the yogi, who in Self discovers all 










his joy; She that, of Her own sweet will, inhabits every living thing. 



















The macrocosm and microcosm rest in the Mother's womb; Now do you see how vast it is? 










In the Muladhara The yogi meditates on Her, and in the Sahasrara: Who but Siva has beheld Her 










as She really is? Within the lotus wilderness She sports beside Her Mate, the Swan. 



















When man aspires to understand Her, Ramprasad must smile; To think of knowing Her, he 










says, is quite as laughable As to imagine one can swim across the boundless sea. But while my 










mind has understood, alas! my heart has not; Though but a dwarf, it still would strive to make a 










captive of the moon. 



















Continuing, the Master said: "Did you notice? 



















The macrocosm and microcosm rest in the Mother's womb; Now do you see how vast it is? 



















Again, the poet says: 



















Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her. 










She cannot be realized by means of mere scholarship. 



















POWER OF FAITH 



















"One must have faith and love. Let me tell you how powerful faith is. A man was about to 










cross the sea from Ceylon to India. Bibhishana said to him: 'Tie this thing in a corner of your 










wearing-cloth, and you will cross the sea safely. You will be able to walk on the water. But be sure 










not to examine it, or you will sink.' The man was walking easily on the water of the sea - such is the 





































strength of faith - when, having gone part of the way, he thought, 'What is this wonderful thing 










Bibhishana has given me, that I can walk even on the water?' He untied the knot and found only a 










leaf with the name of Rama written on it. 'Oh, just this!' he thought, and instantly he sank. 



















"There is a popular saying that Hanuman jumped over the sea through his faith in Rama's 










name, but Rama himself had to build a bridge. 



















"If a man has faith in God, then He need not be afraid though he may have committed sin - 










nay, the vilest sin." 



















Then Sri Ramakrishna sang a song glorifying the Power of faith: 



















If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name, How canst Thou then, Blessed One, 



















Withhold from me deliverance, Wretched though I may be? 



















The Master continued: "Faith and devotion. One realizes God easily through devotion. He is 










grasped through ecstasy of love." 



















With these words the Master sang again: 



















How are you trying, my mind, to know the nature of God? You are groping like a madman 










locked in a dark room. He is grasped through ecstatic love; how can you fathom Him without it? 










Only through affirmation, never negation, can you know Him; Neither through Veda nor through 










Tantra nor the six darsanas. 



















It is in love's elixir only that He delights, mind; He dwells in the body's inmost depths, in 










Everlasting Joy. And, for that love, the mighty yogis practise yoga from age to age; When love 










awakes, the Lord, like a magnet, draws to Him the soul. 



















He it is, says Ramprasad, that I approach as Mother; But must I give away the secret, here in 










the marketplace? From the hints I have given, mind, guess what that Being is! 



















While singing, the Master went into samadhi. He was seated on the bench, facing west, the 










palms of his hands joined together, his body erect and motionless. Everyone watched him 










expectantly. Vidyasagar, too, was speechless and could not take his eyes from the Master. 



















BRAHMAN AND SAKTI ARE IDENTICAL 



















After a time Sri Ramakrishna showed signs of regaining the normal state. He drew a deep 










breath and said with a smile: "The means of realizing God are ecstasy of love and devotion - that is, 










one must love God. He who is Brahman is addressed as the Mother. 



















He it is, says Ramprasad, that I approach as Mother; But must I give away the secret, here in 










the market-place? From the hints I have given, mind, guess what that Being is! 



















"Ramprasad asks the mind only to guess the nature of God. He wishes it to understand that 










what is called Brahman in the Vedas is addressed by Him as the Mother. He who is attributeless 










also has attributes. He who is Brahman is also Sakti. When thought of as inactive, He is called 





































Brahman, and when thought of as the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer, He is called the 










Primordial Energy, Kali. 



















"Brahman and Sakti are identical, like fire and its power to bum. When we talk of fire we 










automatically mean also its power to burn. Again, the fire's power to burn implies the fire itself. 










If you accept the one you must accept the other. 



















"Brahman alone is addressed as the Mother. This is because a mother is an object of great 










love. One is able to realize God just through love. Ecstasy of feeling, devotion, love, and faith - 










these are the means. Listen to a song: 



















As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love; As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain; 










And faith is the root of all. If in the Nectar Lake of Mother Kali's feet My mind remains immersed, 










Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice. 



















GROWTH OF DIVINE LOVE LESSENS WORLDLY DUTIES 



















"What is needed is absorption in God - loving Him intensely. The 'Nectar Lake' is the Lake of 










Immortality. A man sinking in It does not die, but becomes immortal. Some people believe that by 










thinking of God too much the mind becomes deranged; but that is not true. God is the Lake of 










Nectar, the Ocean of Immortality. He is called the 'Immortal' in the Vedas. Sinking in It, one does 










not die, but verily transcends death. Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice. 



















If a man comes to love God, he need not trouble himself much about these activities. One 










needs a fan only as long as there is no breeze. The fan may be laid aside if the southern breeze 










blows. Then what need is there of a fan? 



















(To Vidyasagar) "The activities that you are engaged in are good. It is very good if you can 










perform them in a selfless spirit, renouncing egotism, giving up the idea that you are the doer. 










Through such action one develops love and devotion to God, and ultimately realizes Him. 



















"The more you come to love God, the less you will be inclined to perform action. When the 










daughter-in-law is with child, her mother-in-law gives her less work to do. As time goes by she is 










given less and less work. When the time of delivery nears, she is not allowed to do any work at 










all, lest it should hurt the child or cause difficulty at the time of birth. 



















"By these philanthropic activities you are really doing good to yourself. If you can do them 










disinterestedly, your mind will become pure and you will develop love of God. As soon as you have 










that love you will realize Him. 



















"Man cannot really help the world. God alone does that - He who has created the sun and 










the moon, who has put love for their children in parents' hearts, endowed noble souls with 










compassion, and holy men and devotees with divine love. The man who works for others, without 










any selfish motive, really does good to himself. 



















"There is gold buried in your heart, but you are not yet aware of it. It is covered with a thin 










layer of clay. Once you are aware of it, all these activities of yours will lessen. After the birth of her 





































child, the daughter-in-law in the family busies herself with it alone. Everything she does is only for 










the child. Her mother-in-law doesn't let her do any household duties. 



















PARABLE OF THE WOOD-CUTTER 



















"Go forward. A wood-cutter once entered a forest to gather wood. A brahmachari said to 










him, 'Go forward.' He obeyed the injunction and discovered some sandal-wood trees. After a few 










days he reflected, 'The holy man asked me to go forward. He didn't tell me to stop here.' So he 










went forward and found a silver-mine. After a few days he went still farther and discovered a 










gold-mine, and next, mines of diamonds and precious stones. With these he became immensely 










rich. 



















"Through selfless work, love of God grows in the heart. Then, through His grace one realizes 










Him in course of time. God can be seen. One can talk to him as I am talking to you." 



















In silent wonder they all sat listening to the Master's words. It seemed to them that the 










Goddess of Wisdom Herself, seated on Sri Ramakrishna's tongue was addressing these words not 










merely to Vidyasagar, but to all humanity for its good. 



















It was nearly nine o'clock in the evening. The Master was about to leave. 



















Master (to Vidyasagar, with a smile): "The words I have spoken are really superfluous. You 










know all this; you simply aren't conscious of it. There are countless gems in the coffers of Varuna. 










But he himself isn't aware of them." 



















VIDYASAGAR (with a smile): "You may say as you like." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Oh yes. There are many wealthy people who don't know the names of 










all their servants, and are even unaware of many of the precious things in their houses. "(All laugh.) 



















Everybody was delighted with the Master's conversation. Again addressing Vidyasagar, he 










said with a smile: "Please visit the temple garden some time - 1 mean the garden of Rasmani. It's a 










charming place." 



















VIDYASAGAR: "Oh, of course I shall go. You have so kindly come here to see me, and shall I 










not return your visit?" 



















MASTER: "Visit me? Oh, never think of such a thing!" 



















VIDYASAGAR: "Why, sir? Why do you say that? May I ask you to explain?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "You see, we are like small fishing-boats. (All smile.) We can play in small 










canals and shallow waters and also in big rivers. But you are a ship. You may run aground on the 










way!" (All laugh.) 



















Vidyasagar remained silent. Sri Ramakrishna said with a laugh, "But even a ship can go there 










at this season." 



















VIDYASAGR (smiling): "Yes, this is the monsoon season." (All laugh.) 





































M. said to himself: "This is indeed the monsoon season of newly awakened love. At such 










times one doesn't care for prestige or formalities." 



















Sri Ramakrishna then took leave of Vidyasagar, who with his friends escorted the Master to 










the main gate, leading the way with a lighted candle in his hand. Before leaving the room, the 










Master prayed for the family's welfare, going into an ecstatic mood as he did so. 



















As soon as the Master and the devotees reached the gate, they saw an unexpected sight 










and stood still. In front of them was a bearded gentleman of fair complexion, aged about thirty-six. 










He wore his clothes like a Bengali, but on his head was a white turban tied after the fashion of the 










Sikhs. No sooner did he see the Master than he fell prostrate before him, turban and all. 



















When he stood up the Master said: "Who is this? Balaram? Why so late in the evening?" 



















BALARAM: "I have been waiting here a long time, sir." 



















MASTER: "Why didn't you come in?" 



















BALARAM: "All were listening to you. I didn't like to disturb you." The Master got into the 










carriage with his companions. 



















VIDYASAGAR (to M., softly): "Shall I pay the carriage hire?" 



















M: "Oh, don't bother, please. It is taken care of." 



















Vidyasagar and his friends bowed to Sri Ramakrishna, and the carriage started for 










Dakshineswar. But the little group, with the venerable Vidyasagar at their head holding the lighted 










candle, stood at the gate and gazed after the Master until he was out of sight. 



















ADVICE TO HOUSEHOLDERS 



















August 13, 1882 



















THE MASTER WAS CONVERSING with Kedar and some other devotees in his room in the 










temple garden. Kedar was a government official and had spent several years at Dacca, in East 










Bengal, where he had become a friend of Vijay Goswami. The two would spend a great part of 










their time together, talking about Sri Ramakrishna and his spiritual experiences. Kedar had once 










been a member of the Brahmo Samaj. He followed the path of bhakti. Spiritual talk always brought 










tears to his eyes. 



















It was five o'clock in the afternoon. Kedar was very happy that day, having arranged a 










religious festival for Sri Ramakrishna. A singer had been hired by Ram, and the whole day passed in 










joy. 



















SECRET OF DIVINE COMMUNION 



















The Master explained to the devotees the secret of communion with God. MASTER: "With 










the realization of Satchidananda one goes into samadhi. Then duties drop away. Suppose I have 










been talking about the ostad and he arrives. What need is there of talking about him then? How 










long does the bee buzz around? So long as it isn't sitting on a flower. But it will not do for the 





































sadhaka to renounce duties. He should perform his duties, such as worship, japa, meditation, 










prayer, and pilgrimage. 



















"If you see someone engaged in reasoning even after he has realized God, you may liken 










him to a bee, which also buzzes a little even while sipping honey from a flower." 



















The Master was highly pleased with the ostad's music. He said to the musician, "There is a 










special manifestation of God's power in a man who has any outstanding gift, such as proficiency in 










music." 



















MUSICIAN: "Sir, what is the way to realize God?" 



















MASTER: "Bhakti is the one essential thing. To be sure, God exists in all beings. Who, then, is 










a devotee? He whose mind dwells on God. But this is not possible as long as one has egotism and 










vanity. The water of God's grace cannot collect on the high mound of egotism. It runs down. I am a 










mere machine. 



















MASTER'S RESPECT FOR OTHER FAITHS 



















(To Kedar and the other devotees) "God can be realized through all paths. All religions are 










true. The important thing is to reach the roof. You can reach it by stone stairs or by wooden stairs 










or by bamboo steps or by a rope. You can also climb up by a bamboo pole. 



















MANY NAMES OF ONE GOD 



















"You may say that there are many errors and superstitions in another religion. I should 










reply: Suppose there are. Every religion has errors. Everyone thinks that his watch alone gives the 










correct time. It is enough to have yearning for God. It is enough to love Him and feel attracted to 










Him: Don't you know that God is the Inner Guide? He sees the longing of our heart and the 










yearning of our soul. Suppose a man has several sons. The older boys address him distinctly as 










'Baba' or 'Papa', but the babies can at best call him 'Ba' or 'Pa'. Now, will the father be angry with 










those who address him in this indistinct way? The father knows that they too are calling him, only 










they cannot pronounce his name well. All children are the same to the father. Likewise, the 










devotees call on God alone, though by different names. They call on one Person only. God is one, 










but His names are many." 



















Thursday, August 24, 1882. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was talking to Hazra on the long northeast verandah of his room, when M. 










arrived. He saluted the Master reverently. 



















SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINES NECESSARY AT THE BEGINNING 



















MASTER: "I should like to visit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar a few times more. The painter first 










draws the general outlines and then puts in the details and colours at his leisure. The moulder first 










makes the image out of clay, then plasters it, then gives it a coat of whitewash, and last of all 










paints it with a brush. All these steps must be taken successively. Vidyasagar is fully ready, but his 










inner stuff is covered with a thin layer. He is now engaged in doing good works; but he doesn't 





































know what is within himself. Gold is hidden within him. God dwells within us. If one knows that, 










one feels like giving up all activities and praying to God with a yearning soul." 



















So the Master talked with M. - now standing, now pacing up and down the long verandah. 



















MASTER: "A little spiritual discipline is necessary in order to know what lies within." 



















M: "Is it necessary to practise discipline all through life?" 



















MASTER: "No. But one must be up and doing in the beginning. After that one need not work 










hard. The helmsman stands up and clutches the rudder firmly as long as the boat is passing 










through waves, storms, high wind, or around the curves of a river; but he relaxes after steering 










through them. As soon as the boat passes the curves and the helmsman feels a favourable wind, 










he sits comfortably and just touches the rudder. Next he prepares to unfurl the sail and gets ready 










for a smoke. Likewise, the aspirant enjoys peace and calm after passing the waves and storms of 










'woman and gold'. 



















"WOMAN AND GOLD" IS THE OBSTRUCTION TO YOGA 



















"Some are born with the characteristics of the yogi; but they too should be careful. It is 










'woman and gold' alone that is the obstacle; it makes them deviate from the path of yoga and 










drags them into worldliness. Perhaps they have some desire for enjoyment. 



















After fulfilling their desire, they again direct their minds to God and thus recover their 










former state of mind, fit for the practise of yoga. 



















"Have you ever seen the spring trap for fish, called the 'satka-kal'?" 



















M: "No, sir, I haven't seen it." 



















MASTER: "They use it in our part of the country.One end of a bamboo pole is fastened in 










the ground, and the other is bent over with a catch. From this end a line with a hook hangs over 










the water, with bait tied to the hook. When the fish swallows the bait, suddenly the bamboo 










jumps up and regains its upright position. 



















"Again, take a pair of scales for example. If a weight is placed on one side, the lower needle 










moves away from the upper one. The lower needle is the mind, and the upper one, God. The 










meeting of the two is yoga. 



















"Unless the mind becomes steady there cannot be yoga. It is the wind of worldliness that 










always disturbs the mind, which may be likened to a candle flame. If that flame doesn't move at 










all, then one is said to have attained yoga. 



















'"Woman and gold' alone is the obstacle to yoga. Always analyse what you see. What is 










there in the body of a woman? Only such things as blood, flesh, fat, entrails, and the like. Why 










should one love such a body? 



















"Sometimes I used to assume a rajasic mood in order to practise renunciation. Once I had 










the desire to put on a gold-embroidered robe, wear a ring on my finger, and smoke a 





































hubble-bubble with a long pipe. Mathur Babu procured all these things for me. I wore the 










gold-embroidered robe and said to myself after a while, 'Mind! This is what is called a 










gold-embroidered robe.' Then I took it off and threw it away. I couldn't stand the robe any more. 










Again I said to myself, 'Mind! This is called a shawl, and this a ring, and this, smoking a 










hubble-bubble with a long pipe.' I threw those things away once for all, and the desire to enjoy 










them never arose in my mind again." 



















It was almost dusk. The Master and M. stood talking alone near the door on the southeast 










verandah. 



















MASTER (to M.): "The mind of the yogi is always fixed on God, always absorbed in the Self. 










You can recognize such a man by merely looking at him. His eyes are wide open, with an aimless 










look, like the eyes of the mother bird hatching her eggs. Her entire mind is fixed on the eggs, and 










there is a vacant look in her eyes. Can you show me such a picture?" 



















M: "I shall try to get one." 



















As evening came on, the temples were lighted up. Sri Ramakrishna was seated on his small 










couch, meditating on the Divine Mother. Then he chanted the names of God. Incense was burnt in 










the room, where an oil lamp had been lighted. Sounds of conch shells and gongs came floating on 










the air as the evening worship began in the temple of Kali. The light of the moon flooded all the 










quarters. The Master again spoke to M. 



















GOD AND WORLDLY DUTIES 



















MASTER: "Perform your duties in an unselfish spirit. The work that Vidyasagar is engaged in 










is very good. Always try to perform your duties without desiring any result." 



















M: "Yes, sir. But may I know if one can realize God while performing one's duties? Can 










'Rama' and 'desire' coexist? The other day I read in a Hindi couplet: 'Where Rama is, there desire 










cannot be; where desire is, there Rama cannot be.' " 



















MASTER: "All, without exception, perform work. Even to chant the name and glories of 



















God." 



















M: "Sir, may I make an effort to earn more money?" MASTER: "It is permissible to do so to 










maintain a religious family. You may try to increase your income, but in an honest way. The goal of 










life is not the earning of money, but the service of God. Money is not harmful if it is devoted to the 










service of God." 



















M: "How long should a man feel obliged to do his duty toward his wife and children?" 



















MASTER: "As long as they feel pinched for food and clothing. But one need not take the 










responsibility of a son when he is able to support himself. When the young fledgling learns to pick 










its own food, its mother pecks it if it comes to her for food." 





































M: "How long must one do one's duty?" 





































MASTER: "The blossom drops off when the fruit appears. One doesn't have to do one's duty 










after the attainment of God, nor does one feel like doing it then. 



















"If a drunkard takes too much liquor he cannot retain consciousness. If he takes only two 










or three glasses, he can go on with his work. As you advance nearer and nearer to God, He will 










reduce your activities little by little. Have no fear. 



















"Finish the few duties you have at hand, and then you will have peace. When the mistress 










of the house goes to bathe after finishing her cooking and other household duties, she won't come 










back, however you may shout after her." 



















DIFFERENT GROUPS OF DEVOTEES 



















M: "Sir, what is the meaning of the realization of God? What do you mean by God-vision? 










How does one attain it?" 



















MASTER: "According to the Vaishnavas the aspirants and the seers of God may be divided 










into different groups. These are the pravartaka, the sadhaka, the siddha, and 



















the siddha of the siddha. He who has just set foot on the path may be called a pravartaka. 










He may be called a sadhaka who has for some time been practising spiritual disciplines, such as 










worship, japa, meditation, and the chanting of God's name and glories. He may be called a siddha 










who has known from his inner experience that God exists. An analogy is given in the Vedanta to 










explain this. The master of the house is asleep in a dark room. Someone is groping in the darkness 










to find him. He touches the couch and says, 'No, it is not he.' He touches the window and says, 'No, 










it is not he.' He touches the door and says, 'No, it is not he.' This is known in the Vedanta as the 










process of 'Neti, neti', 'Not this, not this'. At last his hand touches the master's body and he 










exclaims, 'Here he is!' In other words, he is now conscious of the 'existence' of the master. He has 










found him, but he doesn't yet know him intimately. 



















"There is another type, known as the siddha of the siddha, the 'supremely perfect'. It is 










quite a different thing when one talks to the master intimately, when one knows God very 










intimately through love and devotion. A siddha has undoubtedly attained God, but the 










'supremely perfect' has known God very intimately. 



















DIFFERENT MOODS OF ASPIRANTS 



















"But in order to realize God, one must assume one of these attitudes: Santa, Dasya, sakhya, 










Vatsalya, or Madhur. 



















"Santa, the serene attitude. The rishis of olden times had this attitude toward God. They did 










not desire any worldly enjoyment. It is like the single-minded devotion of a wife to her husband. 










She knows that her husband is the embodiment of beauty and love, a veritable Madan. 



















"Dasya, the attitude of a servant toward his master. Hanuman had this attitude toward 










Rama. He felt the strength of a lion when he worked for Rama. A wife feels this mood also. She 










serves her husband with all her heart and soul. A mother also has a little of this attitude, as Yasoda 










had toward Krishna. 





































"Sakhya, the attitude of friendship. Friends say to one another, 'Come here and sit near me.' 










Sridama and other friends sometimes fed Krishna with fruit, part of which they had already eaten, 










and sometimes climbed on His shoulders. 



















"Vatsalya, the attitude of a mother toward her child. This was Yasoda's attitude toward 










Krishna. The wife, too, has a little of this. She feeds her husband with her very lifeblood, as it were. 










The mother feels happy only when the child has eaten to his heart's content. Yasoda would roam 










about with butter in her hand, in order to feed Krishna. 



















"Madhur, the attitude of a woman toward her paramour. Radha had this attitude toward 










Krishna. The wife also feels it for her husband. This attitude includes all the other four." 



















M: "When one sees God does one see Him with these eyes?" 



















MASTER: "God cannot be seen with these physical eyes. In the course of spiritual discipline 










one gets a 'love body', endowed with 'love eyes', 'love ears', and so on. One sees God with those 










'love eyes'. One hears the voice of God with those 'love ears'. One even gets a sexual organ made 










of love." 



















At these words M. burst out laughing. The Master continued, unannoyed, "With this 'love 










body' the soul communes with God." 



















M. again became serious. 



















SEEING GOD EVERYWHERE 



















MASTER: "But this is not possible without intense love of God. One sees nothing but God 










everywhere when one loves Him with great intensity. It is like a person with jaundice, who sees 










everything yellow. Then one feels, 'lam verily He'. 



















"A drunkard, deeply intoxicated, says, 'Verily I am Kali!' The gopis, intoxicated with love, 










exclaimed, 'Verily I am Krishna!' 



















"One who thinks of God, day and night, beholds Him everywhere. It is like a man's seeing 










flames on all sides after he has gazed fixedly at one flame for some time." 



















"But that isn't the real flame", flashed through M.'s mind. 



















Sri Ramakrishna, who could read a man's inmost thought, said: "One doesn't lose 










consciousness by thinking of Him who is all Spirit, all Consciousness. Shivanath once remarked that 










too much thinking about God confounds the brain. Thereupon I said to him, 'How can one become 










unconscious by thinking of Consciousness?' " 



















M: "Yes, sir, I realize that. It isn't like thinking of an unreal object. How can a man lose his 










intelligence if he always fixes his mind on Him whose very nature is eternal Intelligence?" 



















MASTER (with pleasure): "It is through God's grace that you understand that. The doubts of 










the mind will not disappear without His grace. Doubts do not disappear without Self-realization. 





































"But one need not fear anything if one has received the grace of God. It is rather easy for a 










child to stumble if he holds his father's hand; but there can be no such fear if the father holds the 










child's hand. A man does not have to suffer any more if God, in His grace, removes his doubts and 










reveals Himself to him. But this grace descends upon him only after he has prayed to God with 










intense yearning of heart and practised spiritual discipline. The mother feels compassion for her 










child when she sees him running about breathlessly. She has been hiding herself; now she appears 










before the child." 



















"But why should God make us run about?" thought M. 



















Immediately Sri Ramakrishna said: "It is His will that we should run about a little. Then it is 










great fun. God has created the world in play, as it were. This is called Mahamaya, the Great 










Illusion. Therefore one must take refuge in the Divine Mother, the Cosmic Power Itself. It is She 










who has bound us with the shackles of illusion. The realization of God is possible only when those 










shackles are severed." 



















WORSHIP OF THE DIVINE MOTHER 



















The Master continued: "One must propitiate the Divine Mother, the Primal Energy, in order 










to obtain God's grace. God Himself is Mahamaya, who deludes the world with Her illusion and 










conjures up the magic of creation, preservation, and destruction. She has spread this veil of 










ignorance before our eyes. We can go into the inner chamber only when She lets us pass through 










the door. Living outside, we see only outer objects, but not that Eternal Being, 










Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Therefore it is stated in the purna that deities like Brahma 










praised Mahamaya for the destruction of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. 



















"Sakti alone is the root of the universe. That Primal Energy has two aspects: vidya and 










avidya. Avidya deludes. Avidya conjures up 'woman and gold', which casts the spell. Vidya begets 










devotion, kindness, wisdom, and love, which lead one to God. This avidya must be propitiated, and 










that is the purpose of the rites of Sakti worship. 



















"The devotee assumes various attitudes toward Sakti in order to propitiate Her: the attitude 










of a handmaid, a 'hero', or a child. A hero's attitude is to please Her even as a man pleases a 










woman through intercourse. 



















"The worship of Sakti is extremely difficult. It is no joke. I passed two years as the handmaid 










and companion of the Divine Mother. But my natural attitude has always been that of a child 










toward its mother. I regard the breasts of any woman as those of my own mother. 



















MASTER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD WOMEN 



















"Women are, all of them, the veritable images of Sakti. In northwest India the bride holds a 










knife in her hand at the time of marriage; in Bengal, a nut-cutter. The meaning is that the 










bridegroom, with the help of the bride, who is the embodiment of the Divine Power, will sever the 










bondage of illusion. This is the 'heroic' attitude. I never worshipped the Divine Mother that way. 










My attitude toward Her is that of a child toward its mother. 





































"The bride is the very embodiment of Sakti. Haven't you noticed, at the marriage ceremony, 










how the groom sits behind like an idiot? But the bride - she is so bold! 



















HIS LOVE FOR NARENDRA 



















"After attaining God one forgets His external splendour; the glories of His creation. One 










doesn't think of God's glories after one has seen Him. The devotee, once immersed in God's Bliss, 










doesn't calculate any more about outer things. When I see Narendra, I don't need to ask him: 










'What's your name? Where do you live?' Where is the time for such questions? Once a man asked 










Hanuman which day of the fortnight it was. 'Brother,' said Hanuman, 'I don't know anything of the 










day of the week, or the fortnight, or the position of the stars. I think of Rama alone.' " 



















October 16, 1882 



















It was Monday, a few days before the Durga Puja, the festival of the Divine Mother. Sri 










Ramakrishna was in a very happy state of mind, for Narendra was with him. Narendra had brought 










two or three young members of the Brahmo Samaj to the temple garden. Besides these, Rakhal, 










Ramlal, Hazra, and M. were with the Master. 



















Narendra had his midday meal with Sri Ramakrishna. Afterwards a temporary bed was 










made on the floor of the Master's room so that the disciples might rest awhile. A mat was spread, 










over which was placed a quilt covered with a white sheet. A few cushions and pillows completed 










the simple bed. Like a child, the Master sat near Narendranath on the bed. He talked with the 










devotees in great delight. With a radiant smile lighting his face, and his eyes fixed on Narendra, he 










was giving them various spiritual teachings, interspersing these with incidents from his own life. 



















MASTER: "After I had experienced samadhi, my mind craved intensely to hear only about 










God. I would always search for places where they were reciting or explaining the sacred books, 










such as the Bhagavata, the Mahabharata, and the Adhyatma Ramayana. I used to go to 










Krishnakishore to hear him read the Adhyatma Ramayana. 



















KRISHNAKISHORE'S FAITH 



















"What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! Once, while at Vrindavan, he felt thirsty and 










went to a well. Near it he saw a man standing. On being asked to draw a little water for him, the 










man said: 'I belong to a low caste, sir. You are a brahmin. How can I draw water for you?' 










Krishnakishore said: 'Take the name of Siva. By repeating His holy name you will make yourself 










pure.' The low-caste man did as he was told, and Krishnakishore, orthodox brahmin that he was, 










drank that water. What tremendous faith! 



















"Once a holy man came to the bank of the Ganges and lived near the bathing-ghat at 










Ariadaha, not far from Dakshineswar. We thought of paying him a visit. I said to Haladhari: 










'Krishnakishore and I are going to see a holy man. Will you come with us?' Haladhari replied, 'What 










is the use of seeing a mere human body, which is no better than a cage of clay?' Haladhari was a 










student of the Gita and Vedanta philosophy, and therefore referred to the holy man as a mere 










'cage of clay'. I repeated this to Krishnakishore. With great anger he said: 'How impudent of 










Haladhari to make such a remark! How can he ridicule as a "cage of clay" the body of a man who 





































constantly thinks of God, who meditates on Rama, and has renounced all for the sake of the Lord? 










Doesn't he know that such a man is the embodiment of Spirit?' He was so upset by Haladhari's 










remarks that he would turn his face away from him whenever he met him in the temple garden, 










and stopped speaking to him. 



















"Once Krishnakishore asked me, 'Why have you cast off the sacred thread?' In those days of 










God-vision I felt as if I were passing through the great storm of Aswin, and everything had blown 










away from me. No trace of my old self was left. I lost all consciousness of the world. I could hardly 










keep my cloth on my body, not to speak of the sacred thread! I said to Krishnakishore, 'Ah, you will 










understand if you ever happen to be as intoxicated with God as I was.' 



















"And it actually came to pass. He too passed through a God-intoxicated state, when he 










would repeat only the word 'Om' and shut himself up alone in his room. His relatives thought he 










was actually mad, and called in a physician. Ram Kaviraj of Natagore came to see him. 










Krishnakishore said to the physician, 'Cure me, sir, of my malady, if you please, but not of my Om.' 










(All laugh.) 



















"One day I went to see him and found him in a pensive mood. When I asked him about it, 










he said: 'The tax-collector was here. He threatened to dispose of my brass pots, my cups, and my 










few utensils, if I didn't pay the tax; so I am worried.' I said: 'But why should you worry about it? Let 










him take away your pots and pans. Let him arrest your body even. How will that affect you? For 










your nature is that of Kha!' (Narendra and the others laugh.) He used to say to me that he was the 










Spirit, all-pervading as the sky. He had got that idea from the Adhyatma Ramayana. I used to tease 










him now and then, addressing him as 'Kha'. Therefore I said to him that day, with a smile: 'You are 










Kha. Taxes cannot move you!' 



















MASTER'S OUTSPOKENNESS 



















"In that state of God-intoxication I used to speak out my mind to all. I was no respecter of 










persons. Even to men of position I was not afraid to speak the truth. 



















"One day Jatindra came to the garden of Jadu Mallick. I was there too. I asked him: 'What is 










the duty of man? Isn't it our duty to think of God?' Jatindra replied: 'We are worldly people. How is 










it possible for us to achieve liberation? Even King Yudhisthira had to have a vision of hell.' This 










made me very angry. I said to him: 'What sort of man are you? Of all the incidents of Yudhisthira's 










life, you remember only his seeing hell. You don't remember his truthfulness, his forbearance, his 










patience, his discrimination, his dispassion, his devotion to God.' I was about to say many more 










things, when Hriday stopped my mouth. After a little while Jatindra left the place, saying he had 










some other business to attend to. 



















"Many days later I went with Captain to see Raja Sourindra Tagore. As soon as I met him, I 










said, 'I can't address you as "Raja", or by any such title, for I should be telling a lie.' He talked to me 










a few minutes, but even so our conversation was interrupted by the frequent visits of Europeans 










and others. A man of rajasic temperament, Sourindra was naturally busy with many things. 










Jatindra his eldest brother, had been told of my coming, but he sent word that he had a pain in his 










throat and couldn't go out. 





































"One day, in that state of divine intoxication, I went to the bathing-ghat on the Ganges at 










Baranagore. There I saw Jaya Mukherji repeating the name of God; but his mind was on something 










else. I went up and slapped him twice on the cheeks. 



















"At one time Rani Rasmani was staying in the temple garden. She came to the shrine of the 










Divine Mother, as she frequently did when I worshipped Kali, and asked me to sing a song or two. 










On this occasion, while I was singing, I noticed she was sorting the flowers for worship 










absent-mindedly. At once I slapped her on the cheeks. She became quite embarrassed and sat 










there with folded hands. 



















"Alarmed at this state of mind myself, I said to my cousin Haladhari: 'Just see my nature! 










How can I get rid of it?' After praying to the Divine Mother for some time with great yearning, I 










was able to shake off this habit. 



















HIS ANGUISH AT WORLDLY TALK 



















"When one gets into such a state of mind, one doesn't enjoy any conversation but that 










about God. I used to weep when I heard people talk about worldly matters. When I accompanied 










Mathur Babu on a pilgrimage, we spent a few days in Benares at Raja Babu's house. One day I was 










seated in the drawing-room with Mathur Babu, Raja Babu, and others. Hearing them talk about 










various worldly things, such as their business losses and so forth, I wept bitterly and said to the 










Divine Mother: 'Mother, where have You brought me? I was much better off in the temple garden 










at Dakshineswar. Here I am in a place where I must bear about "woman and gold". But at 










Dakshineswar I could avoid it.' " 



















The Master asked the devotees, especially Narendra, to rest awhile, and he himself lay 










down on the smaller couch. 



















HIS ECSTASY IN KIRTAN 



















Late in the afternoon Narendra sang. Rakhal, Latu, M., Hazra, and Priya, Narendra's Brahmo 










friend, were present. The singing was accompanied by the drum: 



















Meditate, my mind, on the Lord Hari, The Stainless One, Pure Spirit through and through. 










How peerless is the light that in Him shines! How soul-bewitching is His wondrous form! How dear 










is He to all His devotees! 



















After this song Narendra sang: 



















Oh, when will dawn for me that day of blessedness When He who is all Good, all Beauty, 










and all Truth, Will light the inmost shrine of my heart? When shall I sink at last, ever beholding 










Him, into that Ocean of Delight? Lord, as Infinite Wisdom Thou shalt enter my soul, And my 










unquiet mind, made speechless by Thy sight, Will find a haven at Thy feet. In my heart's 










firmament, Lord, Thou wilt arise As Blissful Immortality; And as, when the chakora beholds the 










rising moon, It sports about for very joy, So, too, shall I be filled with heavenly happiness When 










Thou appearest unto me. 





































Thou One without a Second, all Peace, the King of Kings! At Thy beloved feet I shall 










renounce my life and so at last shall gain life's goal; 1 shall enjoy the bliss of heaven while yet on 










earth! Where else is a boon so rare bestowed? Then shall I see Thy glory, pure and untouched by 










stain; as darkness flees from night, so will my darkest sins Desert me at Thy dawn's approach. 










Kindle in me, Lord, the blazing fire of faith to be the pole-star of my life; Succour of the weak, 










fulfil my one desire! Then shall I bathe both day and night in the boundless bliss of Thy Love, and 










utterly forget Myself, Lord, attaining Thee. 



















Narendra sang again: 



















With beaming face chant the sweet name of God Till in your heart the nectar overflows. 










Drink of it ceaselessly and share it with all! If ever your heart runs dry, parched by the flames of 










worldly desire, chant the sweet name of God, And heavenly love will moisten your arid soul. 



















Be sure, mind, you never forget to chant His holy name: when danger stares in your face, 










Call on Him, your Father Compassionate; With His name's thunder, snap the fetters of sin! come, 










let us fulfil our hearts' desires By drinking deep of Everlasting Joy, Made one with Him in Love's 










pure ecstasy. 



















Now Narendra and the devotees began to sing kirtan, accompanied by the drum and 










cymbals. They moved round and round the Master as they sang: 



















Immerse yourself for evermore, mind, In Him who is Pure Knowledge and Pure Bliss. 



















Next they sang: 



















Oh, when will dawn for me that day of blessedness When He who is all Good, all Beauty, 










and all Truth Will light the inmost shrine of my heart? 



















At last Narendra himself was playing on the drums, and he sang with the Master, full of joy: 



















WITH BEAMING FACE CHANT THE SWEET NAME OF GOD 



















When the music was over, Sri Ramakrishna held Narendra in his arms a long time and said, 










"You have made us so happy today!" The flood-gate of the Master's heart was open so wide, that 










night, that he could hardly contain himself for joy. It was eight o'clock in the evening. Intoxicated 










with divine love, he paced the long verandah north of his room. Now and then he could be heard 










talking to the Divine Mother. Suddenly he said in an excited voice, "What can you do to me?" Was 










the Master hinting that maya was helpless before him, since he had the Divine Mother for his 










support? 



















Narendra, M., and Priya were going to spend the night at the temple garden. This pleased 










the Master highly, especially since Narendra would be with him. The Holy Mother, who was living 










in the nahabat, had prepared the supper. Surendra bore the greater part of the Master's expenses. 










The meal was ready, and the plates were set out on the southeast verandah of the Masters room. 



















Near the east door of his room Narendra and the other devotees were gossiping. 



















NARENDRA: "How do you find the young men nowadays?" 





































M: "They are not bad; but they don't receive any religious instructions". 



















NARENDRA: "But from my experience I feel they are going to the dogs. They smoke 










cigarettes, indulge in frivolous talk, enjoy foppishness, play truant, and do everything of that sort. I 










have even seen them visiting questionable places." 



















M: "I didn't notice such things during our student days." 



















NARENDRA: "Perhaps you didn't mix with the students intimately. I have even seen them 










talking with people of immoral character. Perhaps they are on terms of intimacy with them." 



















M: "It is strange indeed." 



















NARENDRA: "I know that many of them form bad habits. It would be proper if the guardians 










of the boys, and the authorities, kept their eyes on these matters." 



















They were talking thus when Sri Ramakrishna came to them and asked with a smile, "Well, 










what are you talking about?" 



















NARENDRA: "I have been asking M. about the boys in the schools. The conduct of students 










nowadays isn't all that it should be." 



















The Master became grave and said to M. rather seriously: "This kind of conversation is not 










good. It isn't desirable to indulge in any talk but talk of God. You are their senior, and you are 










intelligent. You should not have encouraged them to talk about such matters." 



















Narendra was then about nineteen years old, and M. about twenty-eight. Thus admonished, 










M. felt embarrassed, and the others also fell silent. 



















While the devotees were enjoying their meal, Sri Ramakrishna stood by and watched them 










with intense delight. That night the Master's joy was very great. 



















After supper the devotees rested on the mat spread on the floor of the Master's room. They 










began to talk with him. It was indeed a mart of joy. The Master asked Narendra to sing the song 










beginning with the line: "In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full." 



















Narendra sang, and other devotees played the drums and cymbals: 



















In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full, And Love's flood-tide, in surging 










waves, is flowing everywhere. Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee! 



















On every side shine devotees, like stars around the moon; Their Friend, the Lord 










All-merciful, joyously plays with them. Behold! The gates of paradise today are open wide. 



















The soft spring wind of the New Day raises fresh waves of joy; gently it carries to the earth 










the fragrance of God's Love, till all the yogis, drunk with bliss, are lost in ecstasy. 



















Upon the sea of the world unfolds the lotus of the New Day, and there the Mother sits 










enshrined in blissful majesty. See how the bees are mad with joy, sipping the nectar there! 





































Behold the Mother's radiant face, which so enchants the heart and captivates the universe! 










About Her Lotus Feet Bands of ecstatic holy men are dancing in delight. 



















What matchless loveliness is Hers! What infinite content pervades the heart when She 










appears! brothers, says Premdas, I humbly beg you, one and all, to sing the Mother's praise! 



















Sri Ramakrishna sang and danced, and the devotees danced around him. 










A DEVOTEE'S DREAM 



















When the song was over, the Master walked up and down the northeast verandah, where 










Hazra was seated with M. The Master sat down there. He asked a devotee, "Do you ever have 










dreams?" 



















DEVOTEE: "Yes, sir. The other day I dreamt a strange dream. I saw the whole world 










enveloped in water. There was water on all sides. A few boats were visible, but suddenly huge 










waves appeared and sank them. I was about to board a ship with a few others, when we saw a 










brahmin walking over that expanse of water. I asked him, 'How can you walk over the deep?' The 










brahmin said with a smile: 'Oh, there is no difficulty about that. There is a bridge under the water.' 










I said to him, 'Where are you going?' 'To Bhawanipur, the city of the Divine Mother', he replied. 










'Wait a little', I cried. 'I shall accompany you.' " 



















MASTER: "Oh. I am thrilled to hear the story!" 



















DEVOTEE: "The brahmin said: 'I am in a hurry. It will take you some time to get out of the 










boat. Good-bye. Remember this path and come after me. 



















MASTER: "Oh, my hair is standing on end! Please be initiated by a guru as soon as possible." 



















Shortly before midnight Narendra and the other devotees lay down on a bed made on the 










floor of the Master's room. 



















At dawn some of the devotees were up. They saw the Master, naked as a child, pacing up 










and down the room, repeating the names of the various gods and goddesses. His voice was sweet 










as nectar. Now he would look at the Ganges, now stop in front of the pictures hanging on the wall 










and bow down before them, chanting all the while the holy names in his sweet voice. He 










chanted: "Veda, Purana, Tantra; Gita, Gayatri; Bhagavata, Bhakta, Bhagavan." Referring to the 










Gita, he repeated many times, "Tagi, tagi, tagi." Now and then he would say: "0 Mother, Thou art 










verily Brahman, and Thou art verily Sakti. Thou art Purusha and Thou art Prakriti. Thou art Virat. 










Thou art the Absolute, and Thou dost manifest Thyself as the Relative. Thou art verily the 










twenty-four cosmic principles." 



















In the mean time the morning service had begun in the temples of Kali and Radhakanta. 










Sounds of conch-shells and cymbals were carried on the air. The devotees came outside the room 










and saw the priests and servants gathering flowers in the garden for the divine service in the 










temples. From the nahabat floated the sweet melody of musical instruments, befitting the 










morning hours. 





































Narendra and the other devotees finished their morning duties and came to the Master. 










With a sweet smile on his lips Sri Ramakrishna was standing on the northeast verandah, close to 










his own room. 



















NARENDRA: "We noticed several sannyasis belonging to the sect of Nanak in the 










Panchavati." 



















MASTER: "Yes, they arrived here yesterday. (To Narendra) I'd like to see you all sitting 










together on the mat." 



















As they sat there the Master looked at them with evident delight. He then began to talk 










with them. Narendra asked about spiritual discipline. 



















MASTER: "Bhakti, love of God, is the essence of all spiritual discipline. Through love one 










acquires renunciation and discrimination naturally." 



















DISCIPLINES OF TANTRA 



















NARENDRA: "Isn't it true that the Tantra prescribes spiritual discipline in the company of 










woman?" MASTER: "That is not desirable. It is a very difficult path and often causes the aspirant's 










downfall. There are three such kinds of discipline. One may regard woman as one's mistress or 










look on oneself as her handmaid or as her child. I look on woman as my mother. To look on oneself 










as her handmaid is also good; but it is extremely difficult to practise spiritual discipline looking on 










woman as one's mistress. To regard oneself as her child is a very pure attitude." 



















The sannyasis belonging to the sect of Nanak entered the room and greeted the Master, 










saying, "Namo Narayanaya." Sri Ramakrishna asked them to sit down. 



















ALL IS POSSIBLE WITH GOD 



















MASTFR: "Nothing is impossible for God. Nobody can describe His nature in words. 










Everything is possible for Him. There lived at a certain place two yogis who were practising 










spiritual discipline. The sage Narada was passing that way one day. Realizing who he was, one of 










the yogis said: 'You have just come from God Himself. What is He doing now?' Narada replied, 










'Why, I saw Him making camels and elephants pass and repass through the eye of a needle.' At this 










the yogi said: 'Is that anything to wonder at? Everything is possible for God.' But the other yogi 










said: 'What? Making elephants pass through the eye of a needle - is that ever possible? You have 










never been to the Lord's dwelling-place.' " 



















At nine o'clock in the morning, while the Master was still sitting in his room, Manomohan 










arrived from Konnagar with some members of his family. In answer to Sri Ramakrishna's kind 










inquiries, Manomohan explained that he was taking them to Calcutta. The Master said: "Today is 










the first day of the Bengali month, an inauspicious day for undertaking a journey. I hope everything 










will be well with you." With a smile he began to talk of other matters. 



















When Narendra and his friends had finished bathing in the Ganges, the Master said to them 










earnestly: "Go to the Panchavati and meditate there under the banyan-tree. Shall I give you 










something to sit on?" 





































DISCRIMINATION AND DISPASSION 



















About half past ten Narendra and his Brahmo friends were meditating in the Panchavati. 










After a while Sri Ramakrishna came to them. M., too, was present. 



















The Master said to the Brahmo devotees: "In meditation one must be absorbed in God. By 










merely floating on the surface of the water, can you reach the gems lying at the bottom of the 










sea?" 



















Then he sang: 



















Taking the name of Kali, dive deep down, mind, Into the heart's fathomless depths, 










Where many a precious gem lies hid. But never believe the bed of the ocean bare of gems if in the 










first few dives you fail; with firm resolve and self-control Dive deep and make your way to Mother 










Kali's realm. 



















Down in the ocean depths of heavenly Wisdom lie The wondrous pearls of Peace, mind; 










And you yourself can gather them, If you but have pure love and follow the scriptures' rule. 










Within those ocean depths, as well, Six alligators, lurk - lust, anger, and the rest - Swimming about 










in search of prey. Smear yourself with the turmeric of discrimination; The very smell of it will shield 










you from their jaws. Upon the ocean bed lie strewn Unnumbered pearls and precious gems; 










Plunge in, says Ramprasad, and gather up handfuls there! 



















Narendra and his friends came down from their seats on the raised platform of the 










Panchavati and stood near the Master. He returned to his room with them. The Master continued: 










"When you plunge in the water of the ocean, you may be attacked by alligators. But they won't 










touch you if your body is smeared with turmeric. There are no doubt six alligators - lust, anger, 










avarice, and so on - within you, in the 'heart's fathomless depths'. But protect yourself with the 










turmeric of discrimination and renunciation, and they won't touch you. 



















FUTILITY OF MERE LECTURING 



















"What can you achieve by mere lecturing and scholarship without discrimination and 










dispassion? God alone is real, and all else is unreal. God alone is substance, and all else is 










nonentity. That is discrimination. 



















"First of all set up God in the shrine of your heart, and then deliver lectures as much as you 










like. How will the mere repetition of 'Brahma' profit you if you are not imbued with discrimination 










and dispassion? It is the empty sound of a conch-shell. 



















"There lived in a village a young man named Padmalochan. People used to call him 'Podo', 










for short. In this village there was a temple in a very dilapidated condition. It contained no image 










of God. Aswattha and other plants sprang up on the ruins of its walls. Bats lived inside, and the 










floor was covered with dust and the droppings of the bats. The people of the village had stopped 










visiting the temple. One day after dusk the villagers heard the sound of a conch-shell from the 










direction of the temple. They thought perhaps someone had installed an image in the shrine and 










was performing the evening worship. One of them softly opened the door and saw Padmalochan 





































standing in a corner, blowing the conch. No image had been set up. The temple hadn't been swept 










or washed. And filth and dirt lay everywhere. Then he shouted to Podo: 



















You have set up no image here, within the shrine, fool! Blowing the conch, you simply 










make Confusion worse confounded. Day and night eleven bats Scream there incessantly. 



















PURIFICATION OF MIND 



















"There is no use in merely making a noise if you want to establish the Deity in the shrine of 










your heart, if you want to realize God. First of all purify the mind. In the pure heart God takes His 










seat. One cannot bring the holy image into the temple if the droppings of bats are all around. The 










eleven bats are our eleven organs: five of action, five of perception, and the mind. 



















"First of all invoke the Deity, and then give lectures to your heart's content. First of all dive 










deep. Plunge to the bottom and gather up the gems. Then you may do other things. But nobody 










wants to plunge. People are without spiritual discipline and prayer, without renunciation and 










dispassion. They learn a few words and immediately start to deliver lectures. It is difficult to teach 










others. Only if a man gets a command from God, after realizing Him, is he entitled to teach." 



















Thus conversing, the Master came to the west end of the verandah. M stood by his side. 










Sri Ramakrishna had repeated again and again that God cannot be realized without discrimination 










and renunciation. This made M. extremely worried. He had married and was then a young man of 










twenty-eight, educated in college in the Western way. Having a sense of duty, he asked himself, 










"Do discrimination and dispassion mean giving up 'woman and gold'?" He was really at a loss to 










know what to do. 



















M. (to the Master): "What should one do if one's wife says: 'You are neglecting me. I shall 










commit suicide?' " 



















MASTER (in a serious tone): "Give up such a wife if she proves an obstacle in the way of 










spiritual life. Let her commit suicide or anything else she likes. The wife that hampers her 










husband's spiritual life is an ungodly wife." 



















Immersed in deep thought, M. stood leaning against the wall. Narendra and the other 










devotees remained silent a few minutes. The Master exchanged several words with them; then, 










suddenly going to M., he whispered in his ear: "But if a man has sincere love for God, then all come 










under his control - the king, wicked persons, and his wife. 



















Sincere love of God on the husband's part may eventually help the wife to lead a spiritual 










life. If the husband is good, then through the grace of God the wife may also follow his example." 



















This had a most soothing effect on M.'s worried mind. All the while he had been thinking: 










"Let her commit suicide. What can I do?" 



















M. (to the Master): "This world is a terrible place indeed." 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "That is the reason Chaitanya said to his companion Nityananda, 










'Listen, brother, there is no hope of salvation for the worldly-minded.' " 





































On another occasion the Master had said to M. privately: "Yes, there is no hope for a 










worldly man if he is not sincerely devoted to God. But he has nothing to fear if he remains in the 










world after realizing God. Nor need a man have any fear whatever of the world if he attains sincere 










devotion by practising spiritual discipline now and then in solitude. Chaitanya had several 










householders among his devotees, but they were householders in name only, for they lived 










unattached to the world." 



















It was noon. The worship was over, and food offerings had been made in the temple. 










The doors of the temple were shut. Sri Ramakrishna sat down for his meal, and Narendra and the 










other devotees partook of the food offerings from the temple. 



















Sunday, October 22, 1882 



















It was the day of Vijaya, the last day of the celebration of the worship of Durga, when the 










clay image is immersed in the water of a lake or river. 



















About nine o'clock in the morning M. was seated on the floor of the Master's room at 










Dakshineswar, near Sri Ramakrishna, who was reclining on the small couch. Rakhal was then living 










with the Master, and Narendra and Bhavanath visited him frequently. Baburam had seen him only 










once or twice. 



















MASTER: "Did you have any holiday during the Durga Puja?" 



















M: "Yes, sir. I went to Keshab's house every day for the first three days of the worship." 










M: "I heard there a very interesting interpretation of the Durga Puja." 










MASTER: "Please tell me all about it." 



















M: "Keshab Sen held daily morning prayers in his house, lasting till ten or eleven. During 










these prayers he gave the inner meaning of the Durga Puja. He said that if anyone could realize the 










Divine Mother, that is to say, could install Mother Durga in the shrine of his heart, then Lakshmi, 










Sarasvati, Kartika, and Ganesa would come there of themselves. Lakshmi means wealth, Sarasvati 










knowledge, Kartika strength, and Ganesa success. By realizing the Divine Mother within one's 










heart, one gets all these without any effort whatever." 



















MASTER: "Is that so?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna listened to the description, questioning M. now and then about the prayers 










conducted by Keshab. At last he said to M.: "Don't go hither and thither. Come here alone. Those 










who belong to the inner circle of my devotees will come only here. Boys like Narendra, Bhavanath, 










and Rakhal are my very intimate disciples. They are not to be thought lightly of. Feed them one 










day. What do you think of Narendra?" 



















M: "I think very highly of him, sir." 





































NARENDRA'S MANY VIRTUES 



















MASTER: "Haven't you observed his many virtues? He is not only well versed in music, vocal 










and instrumental, but he is also very learned. Besides, he has controlled his passions and declares 










he will lead a celibate life. He has been devoted to God since his very boyhood. 



















MEDITATION ON GOD WITH FORM 



















"How are you getting along with your meditation nowadays? What aspect of God appeals to 










your mind - with form or without form?" 



















M: "Sir, now I can't fix my mind on God with form. On the other hand, I can't concentrate 










steadily on God without form." 



















MASTER: "Now you see that the mind cannot be fixed, all of a sudden, on the formless 










aspect of God. It is wise to think of God with form during the primary stages." 



















M: "Do you mean to suggest that one should meditate on clay images?" 



















MASTER: "Why clay? These images are the embodiments of Consciousness." 



















M: "Even so, one must think of hands, feet, and the other parts of body. But again, I realize 










that the mind cannot be concentrated unless one meditates, in the beginning, on God with form. 










You have told me so. Well, God can easily assume different forms. May one meditate on the form 










of one's own mother?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, the mother should be adored. She is indeed an embodiment of Brahman." 



















M. sat in silence. After a few minutes he asked the Master: "What does one feel while 










thinking of God without form? Isn't it possible to describe it?" After some reflection, the Master 










said, "Do you know what it is like?" He remained silent a moment and then said a few words to M. 










about one's experiences at the time of the vision of God with and without form. 



















MASTER: "You see, one must practise spiritual discipline to understand this correctly. 










Suppose, there are treasures in a room. If you want to see them and lay hold of them, you must 










take the trouble to get the key and unlock the door. After that you must take the treasures out. 










But suppose the room is locked, and standing outside the door you say to yourself: 'Here I have 










opened the door. Now I have broken the lock of the chest. Now I have taken out the treasure.' 










Such brooding near the door will not enable you to achieve anything. You must practise discipline. 



















BRAHMAN AND DIVINE INCARNATIONS 



















"The jnanis think of God without form. They don't accept the Divine Incarnation. Praising Sri 










Krishna, Arjuna said, 'Thou art Brahman Absolute.' Sri Krishna replied, 'Follow Me, and you will 










know whether or not I am Brahman Absolute.' So saying, Sri Krishna led Arjuna to a certain place 










and asked him what he saw there. 'I see a huge tree,' said Arjuna, 'and on it I notice fruits hanging 










like clusters of blackberries.' Then Krishna said to Arjuna, 'Come nearer and you will find that these 










are not clusters of blackberries, but clusters of innumerable Krishnas like Me, hanging from the 





































tree.' In other words, Divine Incarnations without number appear and disappear on the tree of the 










Absolute Brahman. 



















"Kavirdas was strongly inclined to the formless God. At the mention of Krishna's name he 










would say: 'Why should I worship Him? The gopis would clap their hands while He performed a 










monkey dance.' (With a smile) But I accept God with form when I am in the company of people 










who believe in that ideal, and I also agree with those who believe in the formless God." 



















M. (smiling): "You are as infinite as He of whom we have been talking. Truly, no one can 










fathom your depth." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Ah! I see you have found it out. Let me tell you one thing. One should 










follow various paths. One should practise each creed for a time. In a game of satrancha a piece 










can't reach the centre square until it completes the circle; but once in the square it can't be 










overtaken by any other piece." 



















M: "That is true, sir." 



















MASTER: "There are two classes of yogis: the bahudakas and the kutichakas. The bahudakas 










roam about visiting various holy places and have not yet found peace of mind. But the kutichakas, 










having visited all the sacred places, have quieted their minds. Feeling serene and peaceful, they 










settle down in one place and no longer move about. In that one place they are happy; they don't 










feel the need of going to any sacred place. If one of them ever visits a place of pilgrimage, it is only 










for the purpose of new inspiration. 



















"I had to practise each religion for a time - Hinduism, Islam, Christianity. Furthermore, I 










followed the paths of the Saktas, Vaishnavas, and Vedantists. I realized that there is only one God 










toward whom all are travelling; but the paths are different. 



















"While visiting the holy places, I would sometimes suffer great agony. Once I went with 










Mathur to Raja Babu's drawing-room in Benares. I found that they talked there only of worldly 










matters - money, real estate, and the like. At this I burst into tears. I said to the Divine Mother, 










weeping: 'Mother! Where hast Thou brought me? I was much better off at Dakshineswar.' In 










Allahabad I noticed the same things that I saw elsewhere - the same ponds, the same grass, the 










same trees, the same tamarind-leaves. 



















MASTER'S ECSTASY AT VRINDAVAN 



















"But one undoubtedly finds inspiration in a holy place. I accompanied Mathur Babu to 










Vrindavan. Hriday and the ladies of Mathur's family were in our party. No sooner did I see the 










Kaliyadaman Ghat than a divine emotion surged up within me. I was completely overwhelmed. 










Hriday used to bathe me there as if I were a small child. 



















"In the dusk I would walk on the bank of the Jamuna when the cattle returned along the 










sandy banks from their pastures. At the very sight of those cows the thought of Krishna would 










flash in my mind. I would run along like a madman, crying: 'Oh, where is Krishna? Where is my 










Krishna?' 





































"I went to Syamakunda and Radhakunda in a palanquin and got out to visit the holy Mount 










Govardhan. At the very sight of the mount I was overpowered with divine emotion and ran to the 










top. I lost all consciousness of the world around me. The residents of the place helped me to come 










down. On my way to the sacred pools of Syamakunda and Radhakunda, when I saw the meadows, 










the trees, the shrubs, the birds, and the deer, I was overcome with ecstasy. My clothes became 










wet with tears. I said: '0 Krishna! Everything here is as it was in the olden days. You alone are 










absent.' Seated inside the palanquin I lost all power of speech. Hriday followed the palanquin. He 










had warned the bearers to be careful about me. 



















"Gangamayi became very fond of me in Vrindavan. She was an old woman who lived all 










alone in a hut near the Nidhuvan. Referring to my spiritual condition and ecstasy, she said, 'He is 










the very embodiment of Radha.' She addressed me as 'Dulali'. When with her, I used to forget my 










food and drink, my bath, and all thought of going home. On some days Hriday used to bring food 










from home and feed me. Gangamayi also would serve me with food prepared by her own hands. 



















"Gangamayi used to experience trances. At such times a great crowd would come to see 










her. One day, in a state of ecstasy, she climbed on Hriday's shoulders. 



















"I didn't want to leave her and return to Calcutta. Everything was arranged for me to stay 










with her. I was to eat double-boiled rice, and we were to have our beds on either side of the 










cottage. All the arrangements had been made, when Hriday said: 'You have such a weak stomach. 










Who will look after you?' 'Why,' said Gangamayi, 'I shall look after him. I'll nurse him.' As Hriday 










dragged me by one hand and she by the other, I remembered my mother, who was then living 










alone here in the nahabat of temple garden. I found it impossible to stay away from her, and said 










to Gangamayi, 'No, I must go.' I loved the atmosphere of Vrindavan." 



















About eleven o'clock the Master took his meal, the offerings from temple of Kali. After 










taking his noonday rest he resumed his conversation with the devotees. Every now and then he 










uttered the holy word "Om" or repeated the sacred names of the deities. 



















After sunset the evening worship was performed in the temples. Since it was the day of 










Vijaya, the devotees first saluted the Divine Mother and then took the dust of the Master's feet. 



















Tuesday, October 24,1882 



















It was three or four o'clock in the afternoon. The Master was standing near the shelf where 










the food was kept, when Balaram and M. arrived from Calcutta and saluted him. Sri Ramakrishna 










said to them with a smile: "I was going to take some sweets from the shelf, but no sooner did I put 










my hand on them than a lizard dropped on my body. At once I removed my hand. (All laugh.) 



















"Oh, yes! One should observe all these things. You see, Rakhal is ill, and my limbs ache too. 










Do you know what's the matter? This morning as I was leaving my bed I saw a certain person, 










whom I took for Rakhal. (All laugh.) Oh, yes! Physical features should be studied. The other day 










Narendra brought one of his friends, a man with only one good eye, though the other eye was not 










totally blind. I said to myself, 'What is this trouble that Narendra has brought with him?' 





































"A certain person comes here, but I can't eat any food that he brings. He works in an office 










at a salary of twenty rupees and earns another twenty by writing false bills. I can't utter a word in 










his presence, because he tells lies. Sometimes he stays here two or three days without going to his 










office. Can you guess his purpose? It is that I should recommend him to someone for a job 










somewhere else. 



















"Balaram comes from a family of devout Vaishnavas. His father, now an old man, is a pious 










devotee. He has a tuft of hair on his head, a rosary of tulsi beads round his neck, and a string of 










beads in his hand. He devotes his time to the repetition of God's name. He owns much property in 










Orissa and has built temples to Radha-Krishna in Kothar, Vrindavan, and other places, establishing 










free guest-houses as well. 



















(To Balaram) "A certain person came here the other day. I understand he is the slave of that 










black hag of a wife. Why is it that people do not see God? It is because of the barrier of 'woman 










and gold'. How impudent he was to say to you the other day, 'A paramahamsa came to my father, 










who fed him with chicken curry!' 



















"In my present of my mind I can eat a little fish soup if it has been offered to the Divine 










Mother beforehand. I can't eat any meat, even if it is offered to the Divine Mother; but I taste it 










with the end of my finger lest She should be angry. (Laughter.) 



















"Well, can you explain this state of my mind? Once I was going from Burdwan to 










Kamarpukur in a bullock-cart, when a great storm arose. Some people gathered near the cart. 










My companions said they were robbers. So I began to repeat the names of God, calling sometimes 










on Kali, sometimes on Rama, sometimes on Hanuman. What do you think of that?" 



















Was the Master hinting that God is one but is addressed differently by different sects? 



















MASTER (to Balaram): "Maya is nothing but 'woman and gold'. A man living in its midst 










gradually loses his spiritual alertness. He thinks all is well with him. The scavenger carries a tub of 










night-soil on his head, and in course of time loses his repulsion to it. One gradually acquires love of 










God through the practice of chanting God's name and glories. (To M.) One should not be ashamed 










of chanting God's holy name. As the saying goes, 'One does not succeed so long as one has these 










three: shame, hatred, and fear.' 



















"At Kamarpukur they sing kirtan very well. The devotional music is sung to the 










accompaniment of drums. 



















(To Balaram) "Have you installed any image at Vrindavan?" 



















BALARAM: "Yes, sir. We have a grove where Krishna is worshipped." 



















THE MASTER AND KESHAB 



















October 27, 1882 





































Master's boat trip with Keshab 





































IT WAS FRIDAY, the day of the Lakshmi Puja. Keshab Chandra Sen had arranged a boat trip 










on the Ganges for Sri Ramakrishna. 



















About four o'clock in the afternoon the steamboat with Keshab and his Brahmo followers 










cast anchor in the Ganges alongside the Kali temple at Dakshineswar. The passengers saw in front 










of them the bathing-ghat and the chandni. To their left, in the temple compound, stood six 










temples of Siva, and to their right another group of six Siva temples. The white steeple of the Kali 










temple, the tree-tops of the Panchavati, and the silhouette of pine-trees stood high against the 










blue autumn sky. The gardens between the two nahabats were filled with fragrant flowers, and 










along the bank of the Ganges were rows of flowering plants. The blue sky was reflected in the 










brown water of the river, the sacred Ganges, associated with the most ancient traditions of Aryan 










civilization. The outer world appeared soft and serene, and the hearts of the Brahmo devotees 










were filled with peace. 



















MASTER IN SAMADHI 



















Sri Ramakrishna was in his room talking with Vijay and Haralal. Some disciples of Keshab 










entered. Bowing before the Master, they said to him: "Sir, the steamer has arrived. Keshab Babu 










has asked us to take you there." A small boat was to carry the Master to the steamer. No sooner 










did he get into the boat than he lost outer consciousness in samadhi. Vijay was with him. 



















M. was among the passengers. As the boat came alongside the steamer, all rushed to the 










railing to have a view of Sri Ramakrishna. Keshab became anxious to get him safely on board. With 










great difficulty the Master was brought back to consciousness of the world and taken to a cabin in 










the steamer. Still in an abstracted mood, he walked mechanically, leaning on a devotee for 










support. Keshab and the others bowed before him, but he was not aware of them. Inside the cabin 










there were a few chairs and a table. He was made to sit on one of the chairs, Keshab and Vijay 










occupying two others. Some devotees were also seated, most of them on the floor, while many 










others had to stand outside. They peered eagerly through the door and windows. Sri Ramakrishna 










again went into deep samadhi and became totally unconscious of the outer world. 



















As the air in the room was stuffy because of the crowd of people, Keshab opened the 










windows. He was embarrassed to meet Vijay, since they had differed in certain principles of the 










Brahrno Samaj and Vijay had separated himself from Keshab's organization, joining another 










society. 



















The Brahmo devotees looked wistfully at the Master. Gradually he came back to sense 










consciousness; but the divine intoxication still lingered. He said to himself in a whisper: "Mother, 










why have You brought me here? They are hedged around and not free. Can I free them?" Did the 










Master find that the people assembled there were locked within the prison walls of the world? Did 










their helplessness make the Master address these words to the Divine Mother? 



















GOD DWELLS IN DEVOTEE S HEART 



















Sri Ramakrishna was gradually becoming conscious of the outside world. Nilmadhav of 










Ghazipur and a Brahmo devotee were talking about Pavhari Baba. Another Brahmo devotee said 





































to the Master: "Sir, these gentlemen visited Pavhari Baba. He lives in Ghazipur. He is a holy man 










like yourself." The Master could hardly talk; he only smiled. The devotee continued, "Sir, Pavhari 










Baba keeps your photograph in his room." Pointing to his body the Master said with a smile, "Just 










a pillow-case." 



















The Master continued: "But you should remember that the heart of the devotee is the 










abode of God. He dwells, no doubt, in all beings, but He especially manifests Himself in the heart 










of the devotee. A landlord may at one time or another visit all parts of his estate, but people say 










he is generally to be found in a particular drawing-room. The heart of the devotee is the 










drawing-room of God. 



















ATTITUDE OF JNANIS AND BHAKTAS 



















"He who is called Brahman by the jnanis is known as Atman by the yogis and as Bhagavan 










by the bhaktas. The same brahmin is called priest, when worshipping in the temple, and cook, 










when preparing a meal in the kitchen. The jnani sticking to the path of knowledge, always reasons 










about the Reality, saying, 'Not this, not this'. Brahman is neither 'this' nor 'that'; It is neither the 










universe nor its living beings. Reasoning in this way, the mind becomes steady. Then it 










disappears and the aspirant goes into samadhi. This is the knowledge of Brahman. It is the 










unwavering conviction of the jnani that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. All these 










names and forms are illusory, like a dream. What Brahman is cannot be described. One cannot 










even say that Brahman is a Person. This is the opinion of the jnanis, the followers of Vedanta 










philosophy. 



















"But the bhaktas accept all the states of consciousness. They take the waking state to be 










real also. They don't think the world to be illusory, like a dream. They say that the universe is a 










manifestation of God's power and glory. God has created all these - sky, stars, moon, sun, 










mountains, ocean, men, animals. They constitute His glory. He is within us, in our hearts. Again, He 










is outside. The most advanced devotees say that He Himself has become all this - the twenty-four 










cosmic principles, the universe, and all living beings. The devotee of God wants to eat sugar, not to 










become sugar. (All laugh.) 



















"Do you know how a lover of God feels? His attitude is: '0 God, Thou are the Master, and I 










am Thy servant. Thou art the Mother, and I am Thy child.' Or again: 'Thou art my Father and 










Mother. Thou art the Whole, and I am a part.' He doesn't like to say, 'I am Brahman.' 



















ATTITUDE OF YOGIS 



















"The yogi seeks to realize the Paramatman, the Supreme Soul. His ideal is the union of the 










embodied soul and the Supreme Soul. He withdraws his mind from sense-objects and tries to 










concentrate it on the Paramatman. Therefore, during the first stage of his spiritual discipline, he 










retires into solitude and with undivided attention practises meditation in a fixed posture. 



















"But the Reality is one and the same. The difference is only in name. He who is Brahman is 










verily Atman, and again, He is the Bhagavan. He is Brahman to the followers of the path of 










knowledge, Paramatman to the yogis, and Bhagavan to the lovers of God." 





































The steamer had been going toward Calcutta; but the passengers, with their eyes fixed on 










the Master and their ears given to his nectar-like words, were oblivious of its motion. 










Dakshineswar, with its temples and gardens, was left behind. The paddles of the boat churned the 










waters of the Ganges with a murmuring sound. But the devotees were indifferent to all this. 










Spellbound, they looked on a great yogi, his face lighted with a divine smile, his countenance 










radiating love, his eyes sparkling with joy-a man who had renounced all for God and who knew 










nothing but God. Unceasing words of wisdom flowed from his lips. 



















REASONING OF JNANIS 



















MASTIER: "The jnanis, who adhere to the non-dualistic philosophy of Vedanta, say that the 










acts of creation, preservation, and destruction, the universe itself and all its living beings, are the 










manifestations of Sakti, the Divine Power. If you reason it out, you will realize that all these are as 










illusory as a dream. Brahman alone is the Reality, and all else is unreal. Even this very Sakti is 










unsubstantial, like a dream. 



















"But though you reason all your life, unless you are established in samadhi, you cannot go 










beyond the jurisdiction of Sakti. Even when you say, 'I am meditating', or 'I am contemplating', 










still you are moving in the realm of Sakti, within Its power. 



















IDENTITY OF BRAHMAN AND SAKTI 



















"Thus Brahman and Sakti are identical. If you accept the one, you must accept the other. It 










is like fire and its power to burn. If you see the fire, you must recognize its power to burn also. 










You cannot think of fire without its power to burn, nor can you think of the power to burn without 










fire. You cannot conceive of the sun's rays without the sun, nor can you conceive of the sun 










without its rays. 



















"What is milk like? Oh, you say, it is something white. You cannot think of the milk without 










the whiteness, and again, you cannot think of the whiteness without the milk. 



















"Thus one cannot think of Brahman without Sakti, or of Sakti without Brahman. One cannot 










think of the Absolute without the Relative, or of the Relative without the Absolute. 



















"The Primordial Power is ever at play. She is creating, preserving, and destroying in play, as 










it were. This Power is called Kali. Kali is verily Brahman, and Brahman is verily Kali. It is one and the 










same Reality. When we think of It as inactive, that is to say, not engaged in the acts of creation, 










preservation, and destruction, then we call It Brahman. But when It engages in these activities, 










then we call It Kali or Sakti. The Reality is one and the same; the difference is in name and form. 



















"It is like water, called in different languages by different names, such as 'jal', 'pani', and so 










forth. There are three or four ghats on a lake. The Hindus, who drink water at one place, call it 'jal'. 










The Mussalmans at another place call it 'pani'. And the English at a third place call it 'water'. All 










three denote one and the same thing, the difference being in the name only. In the same way, 










some address the Reality as 'Allah', some as 'God', some as 'Brahman', some as 'Kali', and others by 










such names as 'Rama', 'Jesus', 'Durga', 'Hari.' " 





































DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF KALI 



















KESHAB (with a smile): "Describe to us, sir, in how many ways Kali, the Divine Mother, 










sports in this world." MASTER (with a smile): "Oh, She plays in different ways. It is She alone who is 










known as Maha-Kali, Nitya-Kali, Smasana-Kali, Raksha-Kali, and Syama-Kali. Maha-Kali and 










Nitya-Kali are mentioned in the Tantra philosophy. When there were neither the creation, nor the 










sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth and when darkness was enveloped in darkness, then 










the Mother, the Formless One, Maha-Kali, the Great Power, was one with Maha-Kala, the 










Absolute. 



















"Syama-Kali has a somewhat tender aspect and is worshipped in the Hindu households. She 










is the Dispenser of boons and the Dispeller of fear. People worship Raksha-Kali, the Protectress, in 










times of epidemic, famine, earthquake, drought, and flood. Smasana-Kali is the embodiment of the 










power of destruction. She resides in the cremation ground, surrounded by corpses, jackals, and 










terrible female spirits. From Her mouth flows a stream of blood, from Her neck hangs a garland of 










human heads, and around Her waist is a girdle made of human hands. 



















BEGINNING OF A CYCLE 



















"After the destruction of the universe, at the end of a great cycle, the Divine Mother 










garners the seeds for the next creation. She is like the elderly mistress of the house, who has a 










hotchpotch-pot in which she keeps different articles for household use. (All laugh.) 



















"Oh, yes! Housewives have pots like that, where they keep 'sea-foam', blue pills, small 










bundles of seeds of cucumber, pumpkin, and gourd, and so on. They take them out when they 










want them. In the same way, after the destruction of the universe, my Divine Mother, the 










Embodiment of Brahman, gathers together the seeds for the next creation. After the creation the 










Primal Power dwells in the universe itself. She brings forth this phenomenal world and then 










pervades it. In the Vedas creation is likened to the spider and its web. The spider brings the web 










out of itself and then remains in it. God is the container of the universe and also what is contained 










in it. 



















"Is Kali, my Divine Mother, of a black complexion? She appears black because She is viewed 










from a distance; but when intimately known She is no longer so. The sky appears blue at a 










distance; but look at it close by and you will find that it has no colour. The water of the ocean looks 










blue at a distance, but when you go near and take it in your hand, you find that it is colourless." 



















The Master became intoxicated with divine love and sang: 



















Is Kali, my Mother, really black? The Naked One, of blackest hue, Lights the Lotus of the 










Heart. . . . 



















The Master continued: "Bondage and liberation are both of Her making. By Her Maya 










worldly people become entangled in 'woman and gold', and again, through Her grace they attain 










their liberation. She is called Saviour, and the remover of the bondage that binds one to the 










world." 





































DIVINE MOTHER S SPORT 



















Then the Master sang the following song in his melodious voice: 



















In the world's busy market-place, Syama, Thou art flying kites; High up they soar on the 










wind of hope, held fast by maya's string. Their frames are human skeletons, their sails of the three 










gunas made; But all their curious workmanship is merely for ornament. Upon the kite-strings Thou 










hast rubbed the manja-paste of worldliness, So as to make each straining strand all the more sharp 










and strong. Out of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free; And Thou dost 










laugh and clap Thy hands, Mother, watching them! On favouring winds, says Ramprasad, the 










kites set loose will speedily Be borne away to the Infinite, across the sea of the world. 



















The Master said: "The Divine Mother is always playful and sportive. This universe is Her 










play. She is self-willed and must always have Her own way. She is full of bliss. She gives freedom to 










one out of a hundred thousand." 



















A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "But, sir, if She likes, She can give freedom to all. Why, then, has She 










kept us bound to the world?" 



















MASTER: "That is Her will. She wants to continue playing with Her created beings. In a game 










of hide-and-seek the running about soon stops if in the beginning all the players touch the 










'granny'. If all touch her, then how can the game go on? That displeases her. Her pleasure is in 










continuing the game. Therefore the poet said: 



















Out of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free; And Thou dost laugh 










and clap Thy hands, Mother, watching them! 



















REASSURANCE TO HOUSEHOLDERS 



















"It is as if the Divine Mother said to the human mind in confidence, with a sign from Her 










eye, 'Go and enjoy the world.' How can one blame the mind? The mind can disentangle itself from 










worldliness if, through Her grace, She makes it turn toward Herself. Only then does it become 










devoted to the Lotus Feet of the Divine Mother." 



















Whereupon Sri Ramakrishna, taking upon himself, as it were, the agonies of all 










householders, sang a song complaining to the Divine Mother: 



















Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart, that even with Thee for Mother, and 










though I am wide awake, There should be robbery in my house. Many and many a time I vow to 










call on Thee, Yet when the time for prayer comes round, I have forgotten. Now I see it is all Thy 










trick. 



















As Thou hast never given, so Thou receivest naught; Am I to blame for this, Mother? 










Hadst Thou but given, Surely then Thou hadst received; Out of Thine own gifts I should have given 










to Thee. Glory and shame, bitter and sweet, are Thine alone; This world is nothing but Thy play. 










Then why, Blissful One, dost Thou cause a rift in it? 



















Says Ramprasad: Thou hast bestowed on me this mind, And with a knowing wink of Thine 










eye Bidden it, at the same time, to go and enjoy the world. And so I wander here forlorn through 





































Thy creation, Blasted, as it were, by someone's evil glance, Taking the bitter for the sweet, 










Taking the unreal for the Real. 



















The Master continued: "Men are deluded through Her maya and have become attached to 










the world. 



















Says Ramprasad: Thou hast bestowed on me this mind, And with a knowing wink of Thine 










eye Bidden it, at the same time, to go and enjoy the world." 



















BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, can't we realize God without complete renunciation?" 



















MASTFR (with a laugh): "Of course you can! Why should you renounce everything? You are 










all right as you are, following the middle path-like molasses partly solid and partly liquid. Do you 










know the game of nax? Having scored the maximum number of points, I am out of the game. I 










can't enjoy it. But you are very clever. Some of you have scored ten points, some six, and some 










five. You have scored just the right number; so you are not out of the game like me. The game can 










go on. Why, that's fine! (All laugh.) 



















"I tell you the truth: there is nothing wrong in your being in the world. But you must direct 










your mind toward God; otherwise you will not succeed. Do your duty with one hand and with the 










other hold to God. After the duty is over, you will hold to God with both hands. 



















BONDAGE AND LIBERATION ARE OF THE MIND 



















"It is all a question of the mind. Bondage and liberation are of the mind alone. The mind 










will take the colour you dye it with. It is like white clothes just returned from the laundry. If you dip 










them in red dye, they will be red. If you dip them in blue or green, they will be blue or green. They 










will take only the colour you dip them in, whatever it may be. Haven't you noticed that, if you read 










a little English, you at once begin to utter English words: Foot fut it mit? Then you put on boots 










and whistle a tune, and so on. It all goes together. Or, if a scholar studies Sanskrit, he will at once 










rattle off Sanskrit verses. If you are in bad company, then you will talk and think like your 










companions. On the other hand, when you are in the company of devotees, you will think and talk 










only of God. 



















"The mind is everything. A man has his wife on one side and his daughter on the other. He 










shows his affection to them in different ways. But his mind is one and the same. 



















"Bondage is of the mind, and freedom is also of the mind. A man is free if he constantly 










thinks: 'I am a free soul. How can I be bound, whether I live in the world or in the forest? I am a 










child of God, the King of Kings. Who can bind me?' If bitten by a snake, a man may get rid of its 










venom by saying emphatically, 'There is no poison in me.' In the same way, by repeating with grit 










and determination, 'I am not bound, I am free', one really becomes so-one really becomes free. 



















"Once someone gave me a book of the Christians. I asked him to read it to me. It talked 










about nothing but sin. (To Keshab) Sin is the only thing one hears of at your Brahmo Samaj, too. 










The wretch who constantly says, 'I am bound, I am bound' only succeeds in being bound. He who 










says day and night, 'I am a sinner, I am a sinner' verily becomes a sinner. 





































REDEEMING POWER OF FAITH 



















"One should have such burning faith in God that one can say: 'What? I have repeated the 










name of God, and can sin still cling to me? How can I be a sinner any more? How can I be in 










bondage any more?' 



















"If a man repeats the name of God, his body, mind, and everything become pure. Why 










should one talk only about sin and hell, and such things? Say but once, '0 Lord, I have undoubtedly 










done wicked things, but I won't repeat them.' And have faith in His name." 



















Sri Ramakrishna became intoxicated with divine love and sang: 



















If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name, How canst Thou then, Blessed One, 










Withhold from me deliverance, Wretched though I may be? . . . 



















MASTER'S PRAYER 



















Then he said: "To my Divine Mother I prayed only for pure love. I offered flowers at Her 










Lotus Feet and prayed to Her: 'Mother, here is Thy virtue, here is Thy vice. Take them both and 










grant me only pure love for Thee. Here is Thy knowledge, here is Thy ignorance. Take them both 










and grant me only pure love for Thee. Here is Thy purity, here is Thy impurity. Take them both, 










Mother, and grant me only pure love for Thee. Here is Thy dharma, here is Thy adharma. Take 










them both, Mother, and grant me only pure love for Thee.' 



















(To the Brahmo devotees) "Now listen to a song by Ramprasad: 



















Come, let us go for a walk, mind, to Kali, the Wish-fulfilling Tree, And there beneath It 










gather the four fruits of life. Of your two wives, Dispassion and Worldliness, Bring alone Dispassion 










only, on your way to the Tree, And ask her son Discrimination about the Truth. 



















When will you learn to lie, mind, in the abode of Blessedness, With Cleanliness and 










Defilement on either side of you? Only when you have found the way to keep these wives 










contentedly under a single roof, Will you behold the matchless form of Mother Syama. 



















Ego and Ignorance, your parents, instantly banish from your sight; And should Delusion seek 










to drag you to its hole, Manfully cling to the pillar of Patience. Tie to the post of Unconcern the 










goats of Vice and Virtue, Killing them with the sword of Knowledge if they rebel. With the children 










of Worldliness, your first wife, plead from a goodly distance, And, if they will not listen, drown 










them in Wisdom's sea. Says Ramprasad: If you do as I say, You can submit a good account, mind, 










to the King of Death, And I shall be well pleased with you and call you my darling. 



















"Why shouldn't one be able to realize God in this world? King Janaka had such realization. 










Ramprasad described the world as a mere 'framework of illusion'. But if one loves God's hallowed 










feet, then- This very world is a mansion of mirth; Here I can eat, here drink and make merry. 










Janaka's might was unsurpassed; What did he lack of the world or the Spirit? Holding to one as 










well as the other, He drank his milk from a brimming cup! (All laugh.) 



















"But one cannot be a King Janaka all of a sudden. Janaka at first practised much austerity in 










solitude. 





































SOLITUDE FOR HOUSEHOLDERS 



















"Even if one lives in the world, one must go into solitude now and then. It will be of great 










help to a man if he goes away from his family, lives alone, and weeps for God even for three days. 










Even if he thinks of God for one day in solitude, when he has the leisure, that too will do him good. 










People shed a whole jug of tears for wife and children. But who cries for the Lord? Now and then 










one must go into solitude and practise spiritual discipline to realize God. Living in the world and 










entangled in many of its duties, the aspirant, during the first stage of spiritual life, finds many 










obstacles in the path of concentration. While the trees on the foot-path are young, they must he 










fenced around; otherwise they will be destroyed by cattle. The fence is necessary when the tree is 










young, but it can be taken away when the trunk is thick and strong. Then the tree won't be hurt 










even if an elephant is tied to it. 



















MALADY OF WORLDLY PEOPLE AND ITS CURE 



















"The disease of worldliness is like typhoid. And there are a huge jug of water and a jar of 










savoury pickles in the typhoid patient's room. If you want to cure him of his illness, you must 










remove him from that room. The worldly man is like the typhoid patient. The various objects of 










enjoyment are the huge jug of water, and the craving for their enjoyment is his thirst. The very 










thought of pickles makes the mouth water; you don't have to bring them near. And he is 










surrounded with them. The companionship of woman is the pickles. Hence treatment in solitude is 










necessary. 



















"One may enter the world after attaining discrimination and dispassion. In the ocean of the 










world there are six alligators: lust, anger, and so forth. But you need not fear the alligators if you 










smear your body with turmeric before you go into the water. 



















Discrimination and dispassion are the turmeric. Discrimination is the knowledge of what is 










real and what is unreal. It is the realization that God alone is the real and eternal Substance and 










that all else is unreal, transitory, impermanent. And you must cultivate intense zeal for God. You 










must feel love for Him and be attracted to Him. The gopis of Vrindavan felt the attraction of 










Krishna. Let me sing you a song: 



















Listen! The flute has sounded in yonder wood. There I must fly, for Krishna waits on the 










path. Tell me, friends, will you come along or no? To you my Krishna is merely an empty name; To 










me He is the anguish of my heart. You hear His flute-notes onlv with your ears, But, oh, I hear 










them in my deepest soul. I hear His flute calling: 'Radha come out! Without you the grove is shorn 










of its loveliness.' " 



















The Master sang the song with tears in his eyes, and said to Keshab and the other Brahmo 










devotees: "Whether you accept Radha and Krishna, or not, please do accept their attraction for 










each other. Try to create that same yearning in your heart for God. Yearning is all you need in 










order to realize Him." 



















Gradually the ebb-tide set in. The steamboat was speeding toward Calcutta. It passed under 










the Howrah Bridge and came within sight of the Botanical Garden. The captain was asked to go a 





































little farther down the river. The passengers were enchanted with the Master's words, and most of 










them had no idea of time or of how far they had come. 



















Keshab began to serve some puffed rice and grated coconut. The guests held these in the 










folds of their wearing-cloths and presently started to eat. Everyone was joyful. The Master noticed, 










however, that Keshab and Vijay rather shrank from each other, and he was anxious to reconcile 










them. 



















DISAGREEMENTS NECESSARY FOR ENRICHING LIFE 



















MASTEIR (to Keshab): "Look here. There is Vijay. Your quarrel seems like the fight between 










Siva and Rama. Siva was Rama's s guru. Though they fought with each other, yet they soon came 










to terms. But the grimaces of the ghosts, the followers of Siva, and the gibberish of the monkeys, 










the followers of Rama, would not come to an end! (Loud laughter.) Such quarrels take place even 










among one's own kith and kin. Didn't Rama fight with His own sons, Lava and Kusa? Again, you 










must have noticed how a mother and daughter, living together and having the same spiritual end 










in view, observe their religious fast separately on Tuesdays, each on her own account-as if the 










welfare of the mother were different from the welfare of the daughter. But what benefits the one 










benefits the other. In like manner, you have a religious society, and Vijay thinks he must have one 










too. (Laughter.) But I think all these are necessary. While Sri Krishna, Himself God Incarnate, 










played with the gopis at Vrindavan, trouble-makers like Jatila and Kutila appeared on the scene. 










You may ask why. The answer is that the play does not develop without trouble-makers. (All 










laugh.) There is no fun without Jatila and Kutila. (Loud laughter.) 



















Ramanuja upheld the doctrine of Qualified Non-dualism. But his guru was a pure 










non-dualist. They disagreed with each other and refuted each other's arguments. That always 










happens. Still, to the teacher the disciple is his own." 



















All rejoiced in the Master's company and his words. 



















MASTER (to Keshab): "You don't look into people's natures, before you make them your 










disciples, and so they break away from you. 



















"All men look alike, to be sure, but they have different natures. Some have an excess of 










sattva, others an excess of rajas, and still others an excess of tamas. You must have noticed that 










the cakes known as puli all look alike. But their contents are very different. Some contain 










condensed milk, some coconut kernel, and others mere boiled kalai pulse. (All laugh) 



















MASTER S HUMILITY 



















"Do you know my attitude? As for myself, I eat, drink, and live happily. The rest the Divine 










Mother knows. Indeed, there are three words that prick my flesh: 'guru', 'master', and 'father'. 



















"There is only one Guru, and that is Satchidananda. He alone is the Teacher. My attitude 










toward God is that of a child toward its mother. One can get human gurus by the million. All 










want to be teachers. But who cares to be a disciple? 





































DIFFICULTY OF PREACHING 



















"It is extremely difficult to teach others. A man can teach only if God reveals Himself to him 










and gives the command. Narada, Sukadeva, and sages like them had such a command from God, 










and Sankara had it too. Unless you have a command from God, who will listen to your words? 



















"Don't you know how easily the people of Calcutta get excited? The milk in the kettle puffs 










up and boils as long as the fire burns underneath. Take away the fuel and all becomes quiet. The 










people of Calcutta love sensations. You may see them digging a well at a certain place. They say 










they want water. But if they strike a stone they give up that place; they begin at another place. 










And there, perchance, they find sand; they give up the second place too. Next they begin at a 










third. And so it goes. But it won't do if a man only imagines that he has God's command. 



















"God does reveal Himself to man and speak. Only then may one receive His command. How 










forceful are the words of such a teacher! They can move mountains. But mere lectures? People 










will listen to them for a few days and then forget them. They will never act upon mere words. 



















"At Kamarpukur there is a small lake called the Haldarpukur. Certain people used to befoul 










its banks every day. Others who came there in the morning to bathe would abuse the offenders 










loudly. But next morning they would find the same thing. The nuisance didn't stop. (All laugh.) 










The villagers finally informed the authorities about it. A constable was sent, who put up a notice 










on the bank which read: 'Commit no nuisance.' This stopped the miscreants at once. (All laugh.) 



















"To teach others, one must have a badge of authority; otherwise teaching becomes a 










mockery. A man who is himself ignorant starts out to teach others-like the blind leading the blind! 










Instead of doing good, such teaching does harm. After the realization of God one obtains an inner 










vision. Only then can one diagnose a person's spiritual malady and give instruction. 



















"Without the commission from God, a man becomes vain. He says to himself, 'I am teaching 










people.' This vanity comes from ignorance, for only an ignorant person feels that he is the doer. A 










man verily becomes liberated in life if he feels: 'God is the Doer. He alone is doing everything. I am 










doing nothing.' Man's sufferings and worries spring only from his persistent thought that he is the 










doer. 



















DOING GOOD TO OTHERS 



















"You people speak of doing good to the world. Is the world such a small thing? And who are 










you, pray, to do good to the world? First realize God, see Him by means of spiritual discipline. If He 










imparts power, then you can do good to others; otherwise not." 



















A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Then, sir, we must give up our activities until we realize God?" 



















MASTER: "No. Why should you? You must engage in such activities as contemplation, 










singing His praises, and other daily devotions." 



















BRAHMO: "But what about our worldly duties-duties associated with our earning money, 










and so on?" 





































MASTER: "Yes, you can perform them too, but only as much as you need for your livelihood. 










At the same time, you must pray to God in solitude, with tears in your eyes, that you may be able 










to perform those duties in an unselfish manner. You should say to Him: '0 God, make my worldly 










duties fewer and fewer; otherwise, Lord, I find that I forget Thee when I am involved in too 










many activities. I may think I am doing unselfish work, but it turns out to be selfish.' People who 










carry to excess the giving of alms, or the distributing of food among the poor, fall victims to the 










desire of acquiring name and fame. 



















"Sambhu Mallick once talked about establishing hospitals, dispensaries, and schools, 










making roads, digging public reservoirs, and so forth. I said to him: 'Don't go out of your way to 










look for such works. Undertake only those works that present themselves to you and are of 










pressing necessity-and those also in a spirit of detachment.' It is not good to become involved in 










many activities. That makes one forget God. Coming to the Kalighat temple, some, perhaps, spend 










their whole time in giving alms to the poor. They have no time to see the Mother in the inner 










shrine! (Laughter.) First of all manage somehow to see the image of the Divine Mother, oven by 










pushing through the crowd. Then you may or may not give alms, as you wish. You may give to the 










poor to your heart's content, if you feel that way. Work is only a means to the realization of God. 










Therefore I said to Sambhu, 'Suppose God appears before you; then will you ask Him to build 










hospitals and dispensaries for you?' (Laughter.) A lover of God never says that. He will rather say: 










'0 Lord, give me a place at Thy Lotus Feet. Keep me always in Thy company. Give me sincere and 










pure love for Thee.' 



















PATH OF DEVOTION MOST ELECTIVE FOR KALIYUGA 



















"Karmayoga is very hard indeed. In the Kaliyuga it is extremely difficult to perform the rites 










enjoined in the scriptures. Nowadays man's life is centred on food alone. He cannot perform many 










scriptural rites. Suppose a man is laid up with fever. If you attempt a slow cure with the 










old-fashioned indigenous remedies, before long his life may be snuffed out. He can't stand much 










delay. Nowadays the drastic 'D Gupta' mixture is appropriate. In the Kaliyuga the best way is 










bhaktiyoga, the path of devotion-singing the praises of the Lord, and prayer. The path of devotion 










alone is the religion for this age. (To the Brahmo devotees) Yours also is the path of devotion. 










Blessed you are indeed that you chant the name of Hari and sing the Divine Mother's glories. I like 










your attitude. You don't call the world a dream like the non-dualists. You are not Brahmajnanis like 










them; you are bhaktas, lovers of God. That you speak of Him as a Person is also good. You are 










devotees. You will certainly realize Him if you call on Him with sincerity and earnestness." 



















The boat cast anchor at Kayalaghat and the passengers prepared to disembark. On coming 










outside they noticed that the full moon was up. The trees, the buildings, and the boats on the 










Ganges were bathed in its mellow light. A carriage was hailed for the Master, and M. and a few 










devotees got in with him. The Master asked for Keshab. Presently the latter arrived and inquired 










about the arrangements made for the Master's return to Dakshineswar. Then he bowed low and 










took leave of Sri Ramakrishna. 



















The carriage drove through the European quarter of the city. The Master enjoyed the sight 










of the beautiful mansions on both sides of the well lighted streets. Suddenly he said: "I am thirsty. 





































What's to be done?" Nandalal, Keshab's nephew, stopped the carriage before the India Club and 










went upstairs to get some water. The Master inquired whether the glass had been well washed. 










On being assured that it had been, he drank the water. 



















As the carriage went along, the Master put his head out of the window and looked with 










childlike enjoyment, at the people, the vehicles, the horses, and the streets, all flooded with 










moonlight. Now and then he heard European ladies singing at the piano. He was in a very happy 










mood. 



















The carriage arrived at the house of Suresh Mitra, who was a great devotee of the Master 










and whom he addressed affectionately as Surendra. He was not at home. 



















The members of the household opened a room on the ground floor for the Master and his 










party. The cab fare was to be paid. Surendra would have taken care of it had he been there. The 










Master said to a devotee: "Why don't you ask the ladies to pay the fare? They certainly know that 










their master visits us at Dakshineswar. I am not a stranger to them. "(All laugh.) 



















Narendra, who lived in that quarter of the city, was sent for. In the mean time Sri 










Ramakrishna and the devotees were invited to the drawing-room upstairs. The floor of the room 










was covered with a carpet and a white sheet. A few cushions were lying about. On the wall hung 










an oil painting especially painted for Surendra, in which Sri Ramakrishna was pointing out to 










Keshab the harmony of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and other religions. On seeing the 










picture Keshab had once said, "Blessed is the man who conceived the idea." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was talking joyously with the devotees, when Narendra arrived. This made 










the Master doubly happy. He said to his young disciple, "We had a boat trip with Keshab today. 










Vijay and many other Brahmo devotees were there. (Pointing to M.) Ask him what I said to Keshab 










and Vijay about the mother and daughter observing their religious fast on Tuesdays, each on her 










own account, though the welfare of the one meant the welfare of the other. I also said to Keshab 










that trouble-makers like jatila and Kutila were necessary to lend zest to the play. (To M.) Isn't that 










so?" 



















M: "Yes, sir. Quite so." 



















It was late. Surendra had not yet returned. The Master had to leave for the temple garden, 










and a cab was brought for him. M. and Narendra saluted him and took their leave. Sri 










Ramakrishna's carriage started for Dakshineswar through the moonlit streets. 



















THE MASTER WITH THE BRAHMO DEVOTEES (I) 



















October 28, 1882 



















IT WAS SATURDAY. The semi-annual Brahmo festival, celebrated each autumn and spring, 










was being held in Benimadhav Pal's beautiful garden house at Sinthi, about three miles north of 










Calcutta. The house stood in a secluded place suited for contemplation. Trees laden with flowers, 










artificial lakes with grassy banks, and green arbours enhanced the beauty of the grounds. Just as 










the fleecy clouds were turning gold in the light of the setting sun, the Master arrived. 





































Many devotees had attended the morning devotions, and in the afternoon people from 










Calcutta and the neighbouring villages joined them. Shivanath, the great Brahmo devotee whom 










the Master loved dearly, was one of the large gathering of members of the Brahmo Samaj who had 










been eagerly awaiting Sri Ramakrishna's arrival. 



















When the carriage bringing the Master and a few devotees reached the garden house, the 










assembly stood up respectfully to receive him. There was a sudden silence, like that which comes 










when the curtain in a theatre is about to be rung up. People who had been conversing with one 










another now fixed their attention on the Master's serene face, eager not to lose one word that 










might fall from his lips. 



















MASTER'S JOY ON SEEING SHIVANATH 



















At the sight of Shivanath the Master cried out joyously: "Ah ! Here is Shivanath ! You see, you 










are a devotee of God. The very sight of you gladdens my heart. One hemp-smoker feels very happy 










to meet another. Very often they embrace each other in an exuberance of joy." 



















The devotees burst out laughing. 



















WORLDLY PEOPLE S INDIFFERENCE TO SPIRITUAL LIFE 



















MASTER: "Many people visit the temple garden at Dakshineswar. If I see some among the 










visitors indifferent to God, I say to them, 'You had better sit over there.' Or sometimes I say, 'Go 










and see the beautiful buildings.' (Laughter.) 



















"Sometimes I find that the devotees of God are accompanied by worthless people. Their 










companions are immersed in gross worldliness and don't enjoy spiritual talk at all. Since the 










devotees keep on, for a long time, talking with me about God, the others become restless. Finding 










it impossible to sit there any longer, they whisper to their devotee friends: 'When shall we be 










going? How long will you stay here?' The devotees say: 'Wait a bit. We shall go after a little 










while.' Then the worldly people say in a disgusted tone: 'Well, then, you can talk. We shall wait for 










you in the boat.' (All laugh.) 



















POWER OF GOD S NAME 



















"Worldly people will never listen to you if you ask them to renounce everything and devote 










themselves whole-heartedly to God. Therefore Chaitanya and Nitai, after some deliberation, made 










an arrangement to attract the worldly. They would say to such persons, 'Come, repeat the name of 










Hari, and you shall have a delicious soup of magur fish and the embrace of a young woman.' Many 










people, attracted by the fish and the woman, would chant the name of God. After tasting a little of 










the nectar of God's hallowed name, they would soon realize that the 'fish soup' really meant the 










tears they shed for love of God, while the 'young woman' signified the earth. The embrace of the 










woman meant rolling on the ground in the rapture of divine love. 



















"Nitai would employ any means to make people repeat Hari's name. Chaitanya said: 'The 










name of God has very great sanctity. It may not produce an immediate result, but one day it must 





































bear fruit. It is like a seed that has been left on the cornice of a building. After many days the 










house crumbles, and the seed falls on the earth, germinates, and at last bears fruit.' 



















THREE CLASSES OF DEVOTEES 



















"As worldly people are endowed with sattva, rajas, and tamas, so also is bakti characterized 










by the three gunas. 



















"Do you know what a worldly person endowed with sattva is like? Perhaps his house is in a 










dilapidated condition here and there. He doesn't care to repair it. The worship hall may be strewn 










with pigeon droppings and the courtyard covered with moss, but he pays no attention to these 










things. The furniture of the house may be old; he doesn't think of polishing it and making it look 










neat. He doesn't care for dress at all; anything is good enough for him. But the man himself is very 










gentle, quiet, kind, and humble; he doesn't injure anyone. 



















"Again, among the worldly there are people with the traits of rajas. Such a man has a watch 










and chain, and two or three rings on his fingers. The furniture of his house is all spick and span. 










On the walls hang portraits of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and other prominent people; the 










building is whitewashed and spotlessly clean. His wardrobe is filled with a large assortment of 










clothes; even the servants have their livery, and all that. 



















"The traits of a worldly man endowed with tamas are sleep, lust, anger, egotism, and the 



















like. 



















THREE KINDS OF BHAKTI 



















"Similarly, bhakti, devotion, has its sattva. A devotee who possesses it meditates on God in 










absolute secret, perhaps inside his mosquito net. Others think he is asleep. Since he is late in 










getting up, they think perhaps he has not slept well during the night. His love for the body goes 










only as far as appeasing his hunger, and that only by means of rice and simple greens. There is no 










elaborate arrangement about his meals, no luxury in clothes, and no display of furniture. Besides, 










such a devotee never flatters anybody for money. 



















"An aspirant possessed of rajasic bhakti puts a tilak on his forehead and a necklace of holy 










rudraksha beads, interspersed with gold ones, around his neck. (All laugh.) At worship he wears a 










silk cloth. 



















"A man endowed with tamasic bhakti has burning faith. Such a devotee literally extorts 










boons from God, even as a robber falls upon a man and plunders his money. 'Bind! Beat! Kill !'-that 










is his way, the way of the dacoits." 



















UTILIZING TAMAS FOR SPIRITUAL WELFARE 



















Saying this, the Master began to sing in a voice sweet with rapturous love, his eyes turned 










upward: 



















Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas, So long as I can breathe my 










last with Kali's name upon my lips? What need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any 





































more, If he repeats the Mother's name at the three holy hours? Rituals may pursue him close, but 










never can they overtake him. Charity, vows, and giving of gifts do not appeal to Madan's mind; The 










Blissful Mother's Lotus Feet are his whole prayer and sacrifice. Who could ever have conceived the 










power Her name possesses? Siva Himself, the God of Gods, sings Her praise with His five mouths! 



















The Master was beside himself with love for the Divine Mother. He sang with fiery 










enthusiasm: 



















If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name, How canst Thou then, Blessed One, 










Withhold from me deliverance, Wretched though I may be? . . . 



















Then he said, "One must take the firm attitude: 'What? I have chanted the Mother's name. 










How can I be a sinner any more? I am Her child, heir to Her powers and glories.' 



















"If you can give a spiritual turn to your tamas, you can realize God with its help. Force your 










demands on God. He is by no means a stranger to you. He is indeed your very own. 



















ILLUSTRATION OF PHYSICIANS 



















"Again, you see, the quality of tamas can be used for the welfare of others. There are three 










classes of physicians: superior, mediocre, and inferior. The physician who feels the patient's pulse 










and just says to him, 'Take the medicine regularly' belongs to the inferior class. He doesn't care to 










inquire whether or not the patient has actually taken the medicine. The mediocre physician is he 










who in various ways persuades the patient to take the medicine, and says to him sweetly: 'My 










good man, how will you be cured unless you use the medicine? Take this medicine. I have made 










it for you myself.' But he who, finding the patient stubbornly refusing to take the medicine, forces 










it down his throat, going so far as to put his knee on the patient's chest, is the best physician. 










This is the manifestation of the tamas of the physician. It doesn't injure the patient; on the 










contrary, it does him good. 



















THREE TYPES OF GURUS 



















"Like the physicians, there are three types of religious teachers. The inferior teacher only 










gives instruction to the disciples but makes no inquiries about their progress. The mediocre 










teacher, for the good of the student, makes repeated efforts to bring the instruction home to him, 










begs him to assimilate it, and shows him love in many other ways. But there is a type of teacher 










who goes to the length of using force when he finds the student persistently unyielding; I call him 










the best teacher." 



















NO FINALITY ABOUT GOD S NATURE 



















A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, has God forms or has He none?" 



















MASTER: "No one can say with finality that God is only 'this' and nothing else. He is 










formless, and again He has forms. For the bhakta He assumes forms. But He is formless for the 










jnani, that is, for him who looks on the world as a mere dream. The bhakta feels that he is one 










entity and the world another. Therefore God reveals Himself to him as a Person. But the 










jnani-the Vedantist, for instance-always reasons, applying the process of 'Not this, not this'. 





































Through this discrimination he realizes, by his inner perception, that the ego and the universe are 










both illusory, like a dream. Then the jnani realizes Brahman in his own consciousness. He cannot 










describe what Brahman is. 



















"Do you know what I mean? Think of Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, as a 










shoreless ocean. Through the cooling influence, as it were, of the bhakta's love, the water has 










frozen at places into blocks of ice. In other words, God now and then assumes various forms for 










His lovers and reveals Himself to them as a Person. But with the rising of the sun of Knowledge, 










the blocks of ice melt. Then one doesn't feel any more that God is a Person, nor does one see 










God's forms. What He is cannot be described. Who will describe Him? He who would do so 










disappears. He cannot find his T any more. 



















ILLUSORINESS OF "I" 



















"If one analyses oneself, one doesn't find any such thing as T. Take an onion, for instance. 










First of all you peel off the red outer skin; then you find thick white skins. Peel these off one after 










the other, and you won't find anything inside. 



















"In that state a man no longer finds the existence of his ego. And who is there left to seek 










it? Who can describe how he feels in that state-in his own Pure Consciousness-about the real 










nature of Brahman? Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner was it in 










the water than it melted. Now who was to tell the depth? 



















SIGN OF PERFECT KNOWLEDGE 



















"There is a sign of Perfect Knowledge. Man becomes silent when It is attained. Then the T, 










which may be likened to the salt doll, melts in the Ocean of Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute 










and becomes one with It. Not the slightest trace of distinction is left. 



















"As long as his self-analysis is not complete, man argues with much ado. But he becomes 










silent when he completes it. When the empty pitcher has been filled with water, when the water 










inside the pitcher becomes one with the water of the lake outside, no more sound is heard. 










Sound comes from the pitcher as long as the pitcher is not filled with water. 



















"People used to say in olden days that no boat returns after having once entered the 'black 










waters' of the ocean. 



















"All trouble and botheration come to an end when the T dies. You may indulge in 










thousands of reasoning, but still the T doesn't disappear. For people like you and me, it is good to 










have the feeling, 'lama lover of God.' 



















PERSONAL GOD FOR DEVOTEES 



















"The Saguna Brahman is meant for the bhaktas. In other words, a bhakta believes that God 










has attributes and reveals Himself to men as a Person, assuming forms. It is He who listens to our 










prayers. The prayers that you utter are directed to Him alone. You are bhaktas, not jnanis or 










Vedantists. It doesn't matter whether you accept God with form or not. It is enough to feel that 





































God is a Person who listens to our prayers, who creates, preserves, and destroys the universe, and 










who is endowed with infinite power. 



















"It is easier to attain God by following the path of devotion." 



















BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, is it possible for one to see God? If so, why can't we see Him?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, He can surely be seen. One can see His forms, and His formless aspect as 










well. How can I explain that to you?" 



















INTENSE LONGING ENABLES ONE TO SEE GOD 



















BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "What are the means by which one can see God?" MASTER: "Can you 










weep for Him with intense longing of heart? Men shed a jugful of tears for the sake of their 










children, for their wives, or for money. But who weeps for God? So long as the child remains 










engrossed with its toys, the mother looks after her cooking and other household duties. But when 










the child no longer relishes the toys, it throws them aside and yells for its mother. Then the 










mother takes the rice-pot down from the hearth, runs in haste, and takes the child in her arms." 



















WHY SO MUCH CONTROVERSY ABOUT GOD? 



















BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, why are there so many different opinions about the nature of 










God? Some say that God has form, while others say that He is formless. Again, those who speak of 










God with form tell us about His different forms. Why all this controversy?" 



















MASTER: "A devotee thinks of God as he sees Him. In reality there is no confusion about 










God. God explains all this to the devotee if the devotee only realizes Him somehow. You haven't 










set your foot in that direction. How can you expect to know all about God? 



















PARABLE OF THE CHAMELEON 



















"Listen to a story. Once a man entered a wood and saw a small animal on a tree. He came 










back and told another man that he had seen a creature of a beautiful red colour on a certain tree. 










The second man replied: 'When I went into the wood, I also saw that animal. But why do you call it 










red? It is green.' Another man who was present contradicted them both and insisted that it was 










yellow. Presently others arrived and contended that it was grey, violet, blue, and so forth and so 










on. At last they started quarrelling among themselves. To settle the dispute they all went to the 










tree. They saw a man sitting under it. On being asked, he replied: 'Yes, I live under this tree and I 










know the animal very well. All your descriptions are true. Sometimes it appears red, sometimes 










yellow, and at other times blue, violet, grey, and so forth. It is a chameleon. And sometimes it has 










no colour at all. Now it has a colour, and now it has none.' 



















"In like manner, one who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature; he alone knows 










that God reveals Himself to seekers in various forms and aspects. God has attributes; then again 










He has none. Only the man who lives under the tree knows that the chameleon can appear in 










various colours, and he knows, further, that the animal at times has no colour at all. It is the others 










who suffer from the agony of futile argument. 





































"Kabir used to say, 'The formless Absolute is my Father, and God with form is my Mother.' 



















"God reveals Himself in the form which His devotee loves most. His love for the devotee 










knows no bounds. It is written in the Purana that God assumed the form of Rama for His heroic 










devotee, Hanuman. 



















VEDANTIC NON-DUALISM 



















"The forms and aspects of God disappear when one discriminates in accordance with the 










Vedanta philosophy. The ultimate conclusion of such discrimination is that Brahman alone is real 










and this world of names and forms illusory. It is possible for a man to see the forms of God, or to 










think of Him as a Person, only so long as he is conscious that he is a devotee. From the standpoint 










of discrimination this 'ego of a devotee' keeps him a little away from God. 



















"Do you know why images of Krishna or Kali are three and a half cubits high? Because of 










distance. Again, on account of distance the sun appears to be small. But if you go near it you will 










find the sun so big that you won't be able to comprehend it. Why have images of Krishna and Kali a 










dark-blue colour? That too is on account of distance, like the water of a lake, which appears green, 










blue, or black from a distance. Go near, take the water in the palm of your hand, and you will find 










that it has no colour. The sky also appears blue from a distance. Go near and you will see that it 










has no colour at all. 



















"Therefore I say that in the light of Vedantic reasoning Brahman has no attributes. The real 










nature of Brahman cannot be described. But so long as your individuality is real, the world also is 










real, and equally real are the different forms of God and the feeling that God is a Person. 



















"Yours is the path of bhakti. That is very good; it is an easy path. Who can fully know the 










infinite God? and what need is there of knowing the Infinite? Having attained this rare human 










birth, my supreme need is to develop love for the Lotus Feet of God. 



















"If a jug of water is enough to remove my thirst, why should I measure the quantity of water 










in a lake? I become drunk on even half a bottle of wine-what is the use of my calculating the 










quantity of liquor in the tavern? What need is there of knowing the Infinite? 



















"The various states of mind of the Brahmajnani are described in the Vedas. The path of 










knowledge is extremely difficult. One cannot obtain jnana if one has the least trace of worldliness 










and the slightest attachment to 'woman and gold'. This is not the path for the Kaliyuga. 



















SEVEN PLANES OF THE MIND 



















"The Vedas speak of seven planes where the mind dwells. When the mind is immersed in 










worldliness it dwells in the three lower planes- at the naval, the organ of generation, and the organ 










of evacuation. In that state the mind loses all its higher visions-it broods only on 'woman and 










gold'. The fourth plane of the mind is at the heart. When the mind dwells there, one has the first 










glimpse of spiritual consciousness. One sees light all around. Such a man, perceiving the divine 










light, becomes speechless with wonder and says: 'Ah! What is this? What is this?' His mind does 










not go downward to the objects of the world. 





































"The fifth plane of the mind is at the throat. When the mind reaches this, the aspirant 










becomes free from all ignorance and illusion. He does not enjoy talking or hearing about anything 










but God. If people talk about worldly things, he leaves the place at once. 



















"The sixth plane is at the forehead. When the mind reaches it, the aspirant sees the form of 










God day and night. But even then a little trace of ego remains. At the sight of that incomparable 










beauty of God's form, one becomes intoxicated and rushes forth to touch and embrace it. But one 










doesn't succeed. It is like the light inside a lantern. One feels as if one could touch the light, but 










one cannot on account of the pane of glass. 



















"In the top of the head is the seventh plane. When the mind rises there, one goes into 










samadhi. Then the Brahmajnani directly perceives Brahman. But in that state his body 



















does not last many days. He remains unconscious of the outer world. If milk is poured into 










his mouth, it runs out. Dwelling on this plane of consciousness, he gives up his body in twenty-one 










days. That is the condition of the Brahmajnani. But yours is the path of devotion. That is a very 










good and easy path. 



















"Once a man said to me, 'Sir, can you teach me quickly the thing you call samadhi?' (All 



















laugh.) 



















DUTIES DROP AWAY WITH DEEPENING OF SPIRITUAL MOOD 



















"After a man has attained samadhi all his actions drop away. All devotional activities, such 










as worship, japa, and the like, as well as all worldly duties, cease to exist for such a person. At the 










beginning there is much ado about work. As a man makes progress toward God, the outer display 










of his work becomes less and less-so much so that he cannot even sing the name and glories of 










God. (To Shivanath) As long as you were not here at the meeting, people talked a great deal about 










you and discussed your virtues. But no sooner did you arrive here than all that stopped. Now the 










very sight of you makes everyone happy. People now simply say, 'Ah! Here is Shivanath Babu.' All 










other talk about you has stopped. 



















WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SAMADHI 



















"After attaining samadhi, I once went to the Ganges to perform tarpan. But as I took water 










in the palm of my hand, it trickled down through my fingers. Weeping, I said to Haladhari, 'Cousin, 










what is this?' Haladhari replied, 'It is called galitahasta in the holy books.' After the vision of God, 










such duties as the performance of tarpan drop away. 



















"In the kirtan the devotee first sings, 'Nitai amar mata hati.' As the devotional mood 










deepens, he simply sings, 'Hati! Hati!' Next, all he can sing is 'Hati'. And last of all he simply sings, 










'Ha!' and goes into samadhi. The man who has been singing all the while then becomes speechless. 



















"Again, at a feast given to the brahmins one at first hears much noise of talking. When the 










guests sit on the floor with leaf-plates in front of them, much of the noise ceases. Then one hears 










only the cry, 'Bring some luchi!' As they partake of the luchi and other dishes, three quarters of the 










noise subsides. When the curd, the last course, appears, one hears only the sound 'soop, soop' as 





































the guests eat the curd with their fingers. Then there is practically no noise. Afterwards all retire to 










sleep, and absolute silence reigns. 



















"Therefore I say, at the beginning of religious life a man makes much ado about work, but as 










his mind dives deeper into God, he becomes less active. Last of all comes the renunciation of work, 










followed by samadhi. 



















"Generally the body does not remain alive after the attainment of samadhi. The only 










exceptions are such sages as Narada, who keep their bodies alive in order to bring spiritual light to 










others. It is also true of Divine Incarnations, like Chaitanya. After the well is dug, one generally 










throws away the spade and the basket. But some keep them 



















in order to help their neighbours. The great souls who retain their bodies after samadhi feel 










compassion for the suffering of others. They are not so selfish as to be satisfied with their own 










illumination. You are well aware of the nature of selfish people. If you ask them to spit at a 










particular place, they won't, lest it should do you good. If you ask them to bring a sweetmeat 










worth a cent from the store, they will perhaps lick it on the way back. (All laugh.) 



















"But the manifestations of Divine Power are different in different beings. Ordinary souls are 










afraid to teach others. A piece of worthless timber may itself somehow float across the water, but 










it sinks even under the weight of a bird. Sages like Narada are like a heavy log of wood, which not 










only floats on the water but also can carry men, cows, and even elephants. 



















(To Shivanath and the other Brahmo devotees) "Can you tell me why you dwell so much on 










the powers and glories of God? I asked the same thing of Keshab Sen. One day Keshab and his 










party came to the temple garden at Dakshineswar. I told them I wanted to hear how they lectured. 










A meeting was arranged in the paved courtyard above the bathing-ghat on the Ganges, where 










Keshab gave a talk. He spoke very well. I went into a trance. After the lecture I said to Keshab, 










'Why do you so often say such things as: "0 God, what beautiful flowers Thou hast made! God, 










Thou hast created the heavens, the stars, and the ocean!" and so on?' Those who love splendour 










themselves are fond of dwelling on God's splendour. 



















"Once a thief stole the jewels from the images in the temple of Radhakanta. Mathur Babu 










entered the temple and said to the Deity: 'What a shame, God! You couldn't save Your own 










ornaments.' 'The idea!' I said to Mathur. 'Does He who has Lakshmi for His handmaid and 










attendant ever lack any splendour? Those jewels may be precious to you, but to God they are no 










better than lumps of clay. Shame on you! You shouldn't have spoken so meanly. 'What riches 










can you give to God to magnify His glory?' 



















"Therefore I say, a man seeks the person in whom he finds joy. What need has he to ask 










where that person lives, the number of his houses, gardens, relatives, and servants, or the amount 










of his wealth? I forget everything when I see Narendra. Never, even unwittingly, have I asked him 










where he lived, what his father's profession was, or the number of his brothers. 



















"Dive deep in the sweetness of God's Bliss. What need have we of His infinite creation and 










unlimited glory?" 





































The Master sang: 





































Dive deep, mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God's Beauty; If you descend to the uttermost 










depths, There you will find the gem of Love. 



















Go seek, mind, go seek Vrindavan in your heart, Where with His loving devotees Sri 










Krishna sports eternally. 



















Light up, mind, light up true wisdom's shining lamp, And let it burn with steady flame 










Unceasingly within your heart. 



















Who is it that steers your boat across the solid earth? It is your guru, says Kubir; Meditate 










on his holy feet. 



















Sri Ramakrishna continued: "It is also true that after the vision of God the devotee desires 










to witness His lila. After the destruction of Ravana at Rama's hands, Nikasha, Ravana's mother, 










began to run away for fear of her life. Lakshmana said to Rama: 'Revered Brother, please explain 










this strange thing to me. This Nikasha is an old woman who has suffered a great deal from the loss 










of her many sons, and yet she is so afraid of losing her own life that she is taking to her heels!' 










Rama bade her come near, gave her assurance of safety, and asked her why she was running away. 










Nikasha answered: '0 Rama, I am able to witness all this lila of Yours because I am still alive. I want 










to live longer so that I may see the many more things You will do on this earth.' (All laugh.) 



















(To Shivanath) "I like to see you. How can I live unless I see pure-souled devotees? I feel as if 










they had been my friends in a former incarnation." 



















REINCARNATION OF SOUL & INSCRUTABILITY OF GOD S WAYS 



















A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, do you believe in the reincarnation of the soul?" MASTER: "Yes, 










they say there is something like that. How can we understand the ways of God through our small 










intellects? Many people have spoken about reincarnation; therefore I cannot disbelieve it. As 










Bhishma lay dying on his bed of arrows, the Pandava brothers and Krishna stood around him. 










They saw tears flowing from the eyes of the great hero. Arjuna said to Krishna: 'Friend, how 










surprising it is! Even such a man as our grandsire Bhishma-truthful, self-restrained, supremely 










wise, and one of the eight Vasusweeps, through maya, at the hour of death.' Sri Krishna asked 










Bhishma about it. Bhishma replied: '0 Krishna, You know very well that this is not the cause of my 










grief. I am thinking that there is no end to the Pandavas' sufferings, though God Himself is their 










charioteer.7 A thought like this makes me feel that I have understood nothing of the ways of God, 










and so I weep.' " 



















It was about half past eight when the evening worship began in the prayer hall. Soon the 










moon rose in the autumn sky and flooded the trees and creepers of the garden with its light. After 










prayer the devotees began to sing. Sri Ramakrishna was dancing, intoxicated with love of God. The 










Brahmo devotees danced around him to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals. All appeared 










to be in a very joyous mood. The place echoed and re-echoed with God's holy name. When the 










music had stopped, Sri Ramakrishna prostrated himself on the ground and, making salutations to 










the Divine Mother again and again, said: "Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan! My salutations at the feet 





































of the jnanis! My salutations at the feet of the bhaktas! I salute the bhaktas who believe in God 










with form, and I salute the bhaktas who believe in God without form. I salute the knowers of 










Brahman of olden times. And my salutations at the feet of the modern knowers of Brahman of the 










Brahmo Samaj!" 



















Then the Master and the devotees enjoyed a supper of delicious dishes, which Benimadhav, 










their host, had provided. 



















Wednesday, November 15, 1882 Master at the circus 



















Sri Ramakrishna, accompanied by Rakhal and several other devotees, came to Calcutta in a 










carriage and called for M. at the school where he was teaching. Then they all set out for the 










Maidan. Sri Ramakrishna wanted to see the Wilson Circus. As the carriage rolled along the 










crowded Chitpore Road, his joy was very great. Like a little child he leaned first out of one side of 










the carriage and then out of the other, talking to himself as if addressing the passers-by. To M. he 










said: "I find the attention of the people fixed on earthly things. They are all rushing about for the 










sake of their stomachs. No one is thinking of God." 



















They arrived at the circus. Tickets for the cheapest seats were purchased. The devotees 










took the Master to a high gallery, and they all sat on a bench. He said joyfully: "Ha! This is a good 










place. I can see the show well from here." There were exhibitions of various feats. A horse raced 










around a circular track over which large iron rings were hung at intervals. The circus rider, an 










Englishwoman, stood on one foot on the horse's back, and as the horse passed under the rings, 










she jumped through them, always alighting on one foot on the horse's back. The horse raced 










around the entire circle, and the woman never missed the horse or lost her balance. 



















When the circus was over, the Master and the devotees stood outside in the field, near the 










carriage. Since it was a cold night he covered his body with his green shawl. 



















NECESSITY OF SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE 



















Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "Did you see how that Englishwoman stood on one foot on her 










horse, while it ran like lightning? How difficult a feat that must be! She must have practised a long 










time. The slightest carelessness and she would break her arms or legs; she might even be killed. 










One faces the same difficulty leading the life of a householder. A few succeed in it through the 










grace of God and as a result of their spiritual practice. But most people fail. Entering the world, 










they become more and more involved in it; they drown in worldliness and suffer the agonies of 










death. A few only, like Janaka, have succeeded, through the power of their austerity, in leading the 










spiritual life as householders. Therefore spiritual practice is extremely necessary; otherwise one 










cannot rightly live in the world." 



















The Master got into the carriage with the devotees and went to Balaram Bose's house. He 










was taken with his companions to the second floor. It was evening and the lamps were lighted. The 










Master described the feats he had seen at the circus. Gradually other devotees gathered, and soon 










he was engaged in spiritual talk with them. 





































MASTER ON CASTE-SYSTEM 



















The conversation turned to the caste-system. Sri Ramakrishna said: "The caste-system can 










be removed by one means only, and that is the love of God. Lovers of God do not belong to any 










caste. The mind, body, and soul of a man become purified through divine love. Chaitanya and 










Nityananda scattered the name of Hari to everyone, including the pariah, and embraced them all. 










A brahmin without this love is no longer a brahmin. And a pariah with the love of God is no longer 










a pariah. Through bhakti an untouchable becomes pure and elevated." 



















ENTANGLEMENT OF HOUSEHOLDERS 



















Speaking of householders entangled in worldliness, the Master said: "They are like the 










silk-worm. They can come out of the cocoon of their worldly life if they wish. But they can't bear 










to; for they themselves have built the cocoon with great love and care. So they die there. Or they 










are like the fish in a trap. They can come out of it by the way they entered, but they sport inside 










the trap with other fish and hear the sweet sound of the murmuring water and forget everything 










else. They don't even make an effort to free themselves from the trap. The lisping of children is 










the murmur of the water; and the other fish are relatives and friends. Only one or two make good 










their escape by running away. They are the liberated souls." 



















The Master then sang: 



















When such delusion veils the world, through Mahamaya's spell, That Brahma is bereft of 










sense, And Vishnu loses consciousness, What hope is left for men? 



















The narrow channel first is made, and there the trap is set; But open though the passage 










lies, the fish, once safely through the gate, do not come out again. 



















The silk-worm patiently prepares its closely spun cocoon; yet even though a way leads 










forth, Encased within its own cocoon, The worm remains to die. 



















The Master continued: "Man may be likened to grain. He has fallen between the millstones 










and is about to be crushed. Only the few grains that stay near the peg escape. Therefore men 










should take refuge at the peg, that is to say, in God. Call on Him. Sing His name. Then you will be 










free. Otherwise you will be crushed by the King of Death." 



















The Master sang again: 



















Mother! Mother! My boat is sinking, here in the ocean of this world; fiercely the hurricane 










of delusion rages on every side! 



















Clumsy is my helmsman, the mind; stubborn my six oarsmen, the passions; into a pitiless 










wind I sailed my boat, and now it is sinking! Split is the rudder of devotion; tattered is the sail of 










faith; into my boat the waters are pouring! Tell me, what shall I do? For with my failing eyes, alas! 










nothing but darkness do I see. Here in the waves I will swim, Mother, and cling to the raft of Thy 










name! 



















Mr. Viswas had been sitting in the room a long time; he now left. He had once been wealthy 










but had squandered everything in an immoral life. Finally he had become indifferent to his wife 





































and children. Referring to Mr. Viswas, the Master said: "He is an unfortunate wretch. A 










householder has his duties to discharge, his debts to pay: his debt to the gods, his debt to his 










ancestors, his debt to the rishis, and his debt to wife and children. If a wife is chaste, then her 










husband should support her; he should also bring up their children until they are of age. Only a 










monk must not save; the bird and the monk do not provide for the morrow. But even a bird 










provides when it has young. It brings food in its bill for its chicks." 



















BALARAM: "Mr. Viswas now wants to cultivate the company of holy people." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "A monk's kamandalu goes to the four principal holy places with 










him, but it still tastes bitter. Likewise, it is said that the Malaya breeze turns all trees into 










sandal-wood. But there are a few exceptions, such as the cotton-tree, the Aswattha, and the hog 










plum. 



















"Some frequent the company of holy men in order to smoke hemp. Many monks smoke it, 










and these householders stay with them, prepare the hemp, and partake of the prasad." 



















Thursday, November 16, 1882 



















The Master had come to Calcutta. In the evening he went to the house of Rajmohan, a 










member of the Brahmo Samaj, where Narendra and some of his young friends used to meet and 










worship according to the Brahmo ceremonies. Sri Ramakrishna wanted to see their worship. He 










was accompanied by M. and a few other devotees. 



















The Master was very happy to see Narendra and expressed a desire to watch the young 










men at their worship. Narendra sang and then the worship began. One of the young men 










conducted it. He prayed, "0 Lord, may we give up everything and be absorbed in Thee!" Possibly 










the youth was inspired by the Master's presence and so talked of utter renunciation. Sri 










Ramakrishna remarked in a whisper, "Much likelihood there is of that!" Rajmohan served the 










Master with refreshments. 



















Sunday, November 19, 1882 



















It was the auspicious occasion of the Jagaddhatri Puja, the festival of the Divine Mother. Sri 










Ramakrishna was invited to Surendra's house in Calcutta; but first he went to the house of 










Manomohan in the neighbourhood. 



















The Master was seated in Manomohan's parlour. He said: "God very much relishes the 










bhakti of the poor and the lowly, just as the cow relishes fodder mixed with oil-cake. King 










Duryodhana showed Krishna the splendour of his wealth and riches, but Krishna accepted the 










hospitality of the poor Vidura. God is fond of His devotees. He runs after the devotee as the cow 










after the calf." 



















The Master sang: 



















And, for that love, the mighty yogis practise yoga from age to age; when love awakes, the 










Lord, like a magnet, draws to Him the soul. 





































Then he said: "Chaitanya used to shed tears of joy at the very mention of Krishna's name. 










God alone is the real Substance; all else is illusory. Man can realize God if he wants to, but he 










madly craves the enjoyment of 'woman and gold'. The snake has a precious stone in its head, but it 










is perfectly satisfied to eat a mere frog. 



















"Bhakti is the one essential thing. Who can ever know God through reasoning? I want love 










of God. What do I care about knowing His infinite glories? One bottle of wine makes me drunk. 










What do I care about knowing how many gallons there are in the grog-shop? One jar of water is 










enough to quench my thirst. I don't need to know the amount of water there is on earth." 



















Sri Ramakrishna arrived at Surendra's house. Many devotees had assembled there, 










including Surendra's elder brother, who was a judge. 



















FUTILITY OF REASONING 



















MASTER (To Surendra's brother): "You are a judge. That is very good. But remember, 










everything happens through God's power. It is He who has given you your high position; that is 










how you became a judge. People think it is they who are great. The water from the roof flows 










through a spout that is shaped like a lion's head. It looks as if the lion were bringing the water out 










through its mouth. But look at the source of the water! A cloud gathers in the sky and rain falls on 










the roof; then the water flows through the pipe and at last comes out through the spout." 



















SURENDRA'S BROTHER: "The Brahmo Samaj preaches the freedom of women and the 










abolition of the caste-system. What do you think about these matters?" 



















MASTER: "Men feel that way when they are just beginning to develop spiritual yearning. A 










storm raises clouds of dust, and one cannot distinguish between the different trees-the mango, 










the hog plum, and the tamarind. But after the storm blows over, one sees clearly. After the first 










storm of divine passion is quelled, one gradually understands that 



















God alone is the Highest Good, the Eternal Substance, and that all else is transitory. One 










cannot grasp this without tapasya and the company of holy men. What is the use of merely 










reciting the written parts for the drum? It is very difficult to put them into practice on the 










instrument. What can be accomplished by a mere lecture? It is austerity that is necessary. By that 










alone can one comprehend. 



















"You asked about caste distinctions. There is only one way to remove them, and that is by 










love of God. Lovers of God have no caste. Through this divine love the untouchable becomes pure, 










the pariah no longer remains a pariah. Chaitanya embraced all, including the pariahs. 



















"The members of the Brahmo Samaj sing the name of Hari. That is very good. Through 










earnest prayer one receives the grace of God and realizes Him. God can be realized by means of all 










paths. The same God is invoked by different names." 



















MASTER ON THEOSOPHY 



















SURENDRA'S BROTHER: "Sir, what do you think of Theosophy?" 





































MASTER: "I have heard that man can acquire superhuman powers through it and perform 










miracles. I saw a man who had brought a ghost under control. The ghost used to procure various 










things for his master. What shall I do with superhuman powers? Can one realize God through 










them? If God is not realized then everything becomes false." 



















November 1882 



















It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when Sri Ramakrishna arrived in Calcutta to 










attend the annual festival of the Brahmo Samaj, which was to be celebrated at Manilal Mallick's 










house. Besides M. and other devotees of the Master, Vijay Goswami and a number of Brahmos 










were present. Elaborate arrangements had been made to make the occasion a success. Vijay was 










to conduct the worship. 



















The kathak recited the life of Prahlada from the Purana. Its substance was as follows: 










Hiranyakasipu, Prahlada's father, was king of the demons. He bore great malice toward God and 










put his own son through endless tortures for leading a religious life. Afflicted by his father, 










Prahlada prayed to God, "0 God, please give my father holy inclinations." 



















At these words the Master wept. He went into an ecstatic mood. Afterwards he began to 










talk to the devotees. 



















MASTER: "Bhakti is the only essential thing. One obtains love of God by constantly chanting 










His name and singing His glories. Ah! What a devotee Shivanath is! He is soaked in the love of God, 










like a cheese-cake in syrup. 



















"One should not think, 'My religion alone is the right path and other religions are false.' God 










can be realized by means of all paths. It is enough to have sincere yearning for God. Infinite are the 










paths and infinite the opinions. 



















THE PURE IN HEART SEE GOD 



















"Let me tell you one thing. God can be seen. The Vedas say that God is beyond mind and 










speech. The meaning of this is that God is unknown to the mind attached to worldly objects. 










Vaishnavcharan used to say, 'God is known by the mind and intellect that are pure.' Therefore it is 










necessary to seek the company of holy men, practise prayer, and listen to the instruction of the 










guru. These purify the mind. Then one sees God. Dirt can be removed from water by a purifying 










agent. Then one sees one's reflection in it. One cannot see one's face in a mirror if the mirror is 










covered with dirt. 



















"After the purification of the heart one obtains divine love. Then one sees God, through His 










grace. One can teach others if one receives that command from God after seeing Him. Before that 










one should not 'lecture'. There is a song that says: 



















You have set up no image here, within the shrine, fool! Blowing the conch, you simply 










make Confusion worse confounded. 





































"You should first cleanse the shrine of your heart. Then you should install the Deity and 










arrange worship. As yet nothing has been done. What can you achieve by blowing the conch-shell 










and simply making a loud noise?" 



















Vijay sat on a raised stool and conducted the worship according to the rules of the Brahmo 










Samaj. Afterwards he sat by the Master. 



















MASTER (to Vijay): "Will you tell me one thing? Why did you harp so much on sin? By 










repeating a hundred times, 'I am a sinner', one verily becomes a sinner. One should have such faith 










as to be able to say, 'What? I have taken the name of God; how can I be a sinner?' God is our 










Father and Mother. Tell Him, '0 Lord, I have committed sins, but I won't repeat them.' Chant His 










name and purify your body and mind. Purify your tongue by singing God's holy name." 



















December 1882 



















In the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the west porch of his room in the temple 










garden at Dakshineswar. Among others, Baburam, Ramdayal, and M. were present. These three 










were going to spend the night with the Master. M. intended to stay the following day also, for he 










was having his Christmas holidays. Baburam had only recently begun to visit the Master. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "A man becomes liberated even in this life when he knows that 










God is the Doer of all things. Once Keshab came here with Sambhu Mallick. I said to him, 'Not even 










a leaf moves except by the will of God.' Where is man's free will? All are under the will of God. 










Nangta was a man of great knowledge, yet even he was about to drown himself in the Ganges. He 










stayed here eleven months. At one time he suffered from stomach trouble. The excruciating pain 










made him lose control over himself, and he wanted to drown himself in the river. There was a long 










shoal near the bathing-ghat. However far he went into the river, he couldn't find water above his 










knees. Then he understood everything and came back. At one time I was very ill and was about to 










cut my throat with a knife. Therefore I say: '0 Mother, I am the machine and Thou art the 










Operator; I am the chariot and Thou art the Driver. I move as Thou movest me; I do as Thou 










makest me do.' " 



















The devotees sing kirtan in the Master's room: 



















Dwell, Lord, Lover of bhakti, In the Vrindavan of my heart, And my devotion unto Thee 










Will be Thy Radha, dearly loved; My body will be Nanda's home, My tenderness will be Yasoda, My 










longing for deliverance Will be Thy gentle gopi maids. Lift the Govardhan of my sin And slay my six 










unyielding passions, Fierce as the demons sent by Kamsa! Sweetly play the flute of Thy grace, 










Charming the milch cow of my mind; Abide in the pasture of my soul. Dwell by the Jamuna of my 










yearning, under the banyan of my hope, For ever gracious to Thy servant; And, if naught but the 










cowherds' love can hold Thee in Vrindavan's vale, Then, Lord, let Dasarathi, too, Become Thy 










cowherd and Thy slave. 



















Again they sang: 



















Sing, bird that nestles deep within my heart! Sing, bird that sits on the Kalpa-Tree of 










Brahman ! Sing God's everlasting praise. Taste, bird, of the four fruits of the Kalpa-Tree, Dharma, 





































artha, kama, moksha. Sing, bird, "He alone is the Comfort of my soul!" Sing, bird, "He alone is 










my life's enduring Joy!" thou wondrous bird of my life, Sing aloud in my heart! Unceasingly sing, 










bird! Sing for evermore, even as the thirsty chatak sings for the raindrop from the cloud. 



















A devotee from Nandanbagan entered the room with his friends. The Master looked at him 










and said, "Everything inside him can be seen through his eyes, as one sees the objects in a room 










through a glass door." This devotee and his brothers always celebrated the anniversary of the 










Brahmo Samaj at their house in Nandanbagan. Sri Ramakrishna had taken part in these festivals. 



















The evening worship began in the temples. The Master was seated on the small couch in his 










room, absorbed in meditation. He went into an ecstatic mood and said a little later: "Mother, 










please draw him to Thee. He is so modest and humble! He has been visiting Thee." Was the Master 










referring to Baburam, who later became one of his foremost disciples? 



















Why so much suffering in God's creation? 



















The Master explained the different kinds of samadhi to the devotees. The conversation then 










turned to the joy and suffering of life. Why did God create so much suffering? 



















M: "Once Vidyasagar said in a mood of pique: 'What is the use of calling on God? Just think 










of this incident: At one time Chenghiz Khan plundered a country and imprisoned many people. The 










number of prisoners rose to about a hundred thousand. The commander of his army said to him: 










"Your Majesty, who will feed them? It is risky to keep them with us. It will be equally dangerous to 










release them. What shall I do?" Chenghiz Khan said: "That's true. What can be done? Well, have 










them killed." The order was accordingly given to cut them to pieces. Now, God saw this slaughter, 










didn't He? But He didn't stop it in any way. Therefore I don't need God, whether He exists or not. I 










don't derive any good from Him.'" 



















MASTER: "Is it possible to understand God's action and His motive? He creates, He 










preserves, and He destroys. Can we ever understand why He destroys? I say to the Divine Mother: 










'0 Mother, I do not need to understand. Please give me love for Thy Lotus Feet.' The aim of human 










life is to attain bhakti. As for other things, the Mother knows best. I have come to the garden to 










eat mangoes. What is the use of my calculating the number of trees, branches, and leaves? I only 










eat the mangoes; I don't need to know the number of trees and leaves." 



















Baburam, M., and Ramdayal slept that night on the floor of the Master's room. 



















It was an early hour of the morning, about two or three o'clock. The room was dark. Sri 










Ramakrishna was seated on his bed and now and then conversed with the devotees. 



















COMPASSION AND ATTACHMENT 



















MASTER: "Remember that daya, compassion, and maya, attachment, are two different 










things. Attachment means the feeling of 'my-ness' toward one's relatives. It is the love one feels 










for one's parents, one's brother, one's sister, one's wife and children. Compassion is the love one 










feels for all beings of the world. It is an attitude of equality. If you see anywhere an instance of 










compassion, as in Vidyasagar, know that it is due to the grace of God. Through compassion one 










serves all beings. Maya also comes from God. Through maya God makes one serve one's relatives. 





































But one thing should be remembered: maya keeps us in ignorance and entangles us in the world, 










whereas daya makes our hearts pure and gradually unties our bonds. 



















"God cannot be realized without purity of heart. One receives the grace of God by subduing 










the passions-lust, anger, and greed. Then one sees God. I tried many things in order to conquer 










lust. 



















"When I was ten or eleven years old and lived at Kamarpukur, I first experienced samadhi. 










As I was passing through a paddy-field, I saw something and was overwhelmed. There are certain 










characteristics of God-vision. One sees light, feels joy, and experiences the upsurge of a great 










current in one's chest, like the bursting of a rocket." 



















The next day Baburam and Ramdayal returned to Calcutta. M. spent the day and the night 










with the Master. 



















December 1882 



















It was afternoon. The Master was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar with M. and one or 










two other devotees. Several Marwari devotees arrived and saluted the Master. They requested Sri 










Ramakrishna to give them spiritual instruction. He smiled. 



















MASTER (to the Marwari devotees): "You see, the feeling of T and 'mine' is the result of 










ignorance. But to say, '0 God, Thou art the Doer; all these belong to Thee' is the sign of 










Knowledge. How can you say such a thing as 'mine'? The superintendent of the garden says, 'This 










is my garden.' But if he is dismissed because of some misconduct, then he does not have the 










courage to take away even such a worthless thing as his mango-wood box. Anger and lust cannot 










be destroyed. Turn them toward God. If you must feel desire and temptation, then desire to 










realize God, feel tempted by Him. Discriminate and turn the passions away from worldly objects. 










When the elephant is about to devour a plaintain-tree in someone's garden, the mahut strikes it 










with his iron-tipped goad. 



















"You are merchants. You know how to improve your business gradually. Some of you start 










with a castor-oil factory. After making some money at that, you open a cloth shop. In the same 










way, one makes progress toward God. It may be that you go into solitude, now and then, and 










devote more time to prayer. 



















"But you must remember that nothing can be achieved except in its proper time. Some 










persons must pass through many experiences and perform many worldly duties before they can 










turn their attention to God; so they have to wait a long time. If an abscess is lanced before it is 










soft, the result is not good; the surgeon makes the opening when it is soft and has come to a head. 










Once a child said to its mother: 'Mother, I am going to sleep now. Please wake me up when I feel 










the call of nature.' 'My child,' said the mother, 'when it is time for that, you will wake up yourself. I 










shan't have to wake you.' " 



















The Marwari devotees generally brought offerings of fruit, candy, and other sweets for the 










Master. But Sri Ramakrishna could hardly eat them. He would say: "They earn their money by 










falsehood. I can't eat their offerings." He said to the Marwaris: "You see, one can't strictly adhere 





































to truth in business. There are ups and downs in business. Nanak once said, 'I was about to eat the 










food of unholy people, when I found it stained with blood.' A man should offer only pure things to 










holy men. He shouldn't give them food earned by dishonest means. God is realized by following 










the path of truth. One should always chant His name. Even while one is performing one's duties, 










the mind should be left with God. Suppose I have a carbuncle on my back. I perform my duties, but 










the mind is drawn to the carbuncle. It is good to repeat the name of Rama. 'The same Rama who 










was the son of King Dasaratha has created this world. Again, as Spirit, He pervades all beings. He is 










very near us; He is both within and without.' " 



















THE MASTER AND VIJAY GOSWAMI 



















Thursday, December 14, 1882 



















IT WAS AFTERNOON. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed after a short noonday rest. 










Vijay, Balaram, M., and a few other devotees were sitting on the floor with their faces toward the 










Master. They could see the sacred river Ganges through the door. Since it was winter all were 










wrapped up in warm clothes. Vijay had been suffering from colic and had brought some medicine 










with him. 



















VIJAY, THE BRAHMO PREACHER 



















Vijay was a paid preacher in the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, but there were many things about 










which he could not agree with the Samaj authorities. He came from a very noble family of Bengal 










noted for its piety and other spiritual qualities. Advaita Goswami, one of his remote ancestors, had 










been an intimate companion of Sri Chaitanya. Thus the blood of a great lover of God flowed in 










Vijay's veins. As an adherent of the Brahmo Samaj, Vijay no doubt meditated on the formless 










Brahman; but his innate love of God, inherited from his distinguished ancestors, had merely been 










waiting for the proper time to manifest itself in all its sweetness. Thus Vijay was irresistibly 










attracted by the God-intoxicated state of Sri Ramakrishna and often sought his company. He would 










listen to the Master's words with great respect, and they would dance together in an ecstasy of 










divine love. 



















It was a week-day. Generally devotees came to the Master in large numbers on Sundays; 










hence those who wanted to have intimate talks with him visited him on weekdays. 



















TENDENCIES FROM PREVIOUS BIRTHS 



















A boy named Vishnu, living in Ariadaha, had recently committed suicide by cutting his 










throat with a razor. The talk turned to him. 



















MASTER: "I felt very badly when I heard of the boy's passing away. He was a pupil in a 










school and he used to come here. He would often say to me that he couldn't enjoy worldly life. He 










had lived with some relatives in the western provinces and at that time used to meditate in 










solitude, in the meadows, hills, and forests. He told me he had visions of many divine forms. 



















"Perhaps this was his last birth. He must have finished most of his duties in his previous 










birth. The little that had been left undone was perhaps finished in this one. 





































"One must admit the existence of tendencies inherited from previous births. There is a story 










about a man who practised the sava-sadhana.l He worshipped the Divine Mother in 



















a deep forest. First he saw many terrible visions. Finally a tiger attacked and killed him. 










Another man, happening to pass and seeing the approach of the tiger, had climbed a tree. 










Afterwards he got down and found all the arrangements for worship at hand. He performed some 










purifying ceremonies and seated himself on the corpse. No sooner had he done a little japa than 










the Divine Mother appeared before him and said: 'My child, I am very much pleased with you. 










Accept a boon from Me.' He bowed low at the Lotus Feet of the Goddess and said: 'May I ask You 










one question, Mother? I am speechless with amazement at Your action. The other man worked so 










hard to get the ingredients for Your worship and tried to propitiate You for such a long time, but 










You didn't condescend to show him Your favour. And I, who don't know anything of worship, who 










have done nothing, who have neither devotion nor knowledge nor love, and who haven't practised 










any austerities, am receiving so much of Your grace.' The Divine Mother said with a laugh: 'My 










child, you don't remember your previous births. For many births you tried to propitiate Me 










through austerities. As a result of those austerities all these things have come to hand, and you 










have been blessed with My Vision. Now ask Me your boon.' " 



















SUICIDE AFTER THE VISION OF GOD 



















A DEVOTEE: "I am frightened to hear of the suicide." MASTER: "Suicide is a heinous sin, 










undoubtedly. A man who kills himself must return again and again to this world and suffer its 










agony. 



















"But I don't call it suicide if a person leaves his body after having the vision of God. There is 










no harm in giving up one's body that way. After attaining Knowledge some people give up their 










bodies. After the gold image has been cast in the clay mould, you may either preserve the mould 










or break it. 



















"Many years ago a young man of about twenty used to come to the temple garden from 










Baranagore; his name was Gopal Sen. In my presence he used to experience such intense ecstasy 










that Hriday had to support him for fear he might fall to the ground and break his limbs. That young 










man touched my feet one day and said: 'Sir, I shall not be able to see you any more. Let me bid you 










good-bye.' A few days later I learnt that he had given up his body. 



















FOUR CLASSES OF MEN 



















"It is said that there are four classes of human beings: the bound, those aspiring after 










liberation, the liberated, and the ever-perfect. 



















PARABLE OF THE FISH AND THE NET 



















"This world is like a fishing-net. Men are the fish, and God, whose maya has created this 










world, is the fisherman. When the fish are entangled in the net, some of them try to tear through 










its meshes in order to get their liberation. They are like the men striving after liberation. But by no 










means all of them escape. Only a few jump out of the net with a loud splash, and then people say, 










'Ah! There goes a big one!' In like manner, three or four men attain liberation. Again, some fish are 





































so careful by nature that they are never caught in the net; some beings of the ever-perfect class, 










like Narada, are never entangled in the meshes of worldliness. Most of the fish are trapped; but 










they are not conscious of the net and of their imminent death. No sooner are they entangled than 










they run headlong, net and all, trying to hide themselves in the mud. They don't make the least 










effort to get free. On the contrary, they go deeper and deeper into the mud. These fish are like the 










bound men. They are still inside the net, but they think they are quite safe there. A bound creature 










is immersed in worldliness, in 'woman and gold', having gone deep into the mire of degradation. 










But still he believes he is quite happy and secure. The liberated, and the seekers after liberation, 










look on the world as a deep well. They do not enjoy it. Therefore, after the attainment of 










Knowledge, the realization of God, some give up their bodies. But such a thing is rare indeed. 



















WORLDLY-MINDED FORGET THEIR LESSONS 



















"The bound creatures, entangled in worldliness, will not come to their senses at all. They 










suffer so much misery and agony, they face so many dangers, and yet they will not wake up. 



















"The camel loves to eat thorny bushes. The more it eats the thorns, the more the blood 










gushes from its mouth. Still it must eat thorny plants and will never give them up. The man of 










worldly nature suffers so much sorrow and affliction, but he forgets it all in a few days and begins 










his old life over again. Suppose a man has lost his wife or she has turned unfaithful. Lo! He marries 










again. 



















"Or take the instance of a mother: her son dies and she suffers bitter grief; but after a few 










days she forgets all about it. The mother, so overwhelmed with sorrow a few days before, now 










attends to her toilet and puts on her jewelry. A father becomes bankrupt through the marriage of 










his daughters, yet he goes on having children year after year. People are ruined by litigation, yet 










they go to court all the same. There are men who cannot feed the children they have, who cannot 










clothe them or provide decent shelter for them; yet they have more children every year. 



















"Again, the worldly man is like a snake trying to swallow a mole. The snake can neither 










swallow the mole nor give it up. The bound soul may have realized that there is no substance to 










the world-that the world is like a hog plum, only stone and skin-but still he cannot give it up and 










turn his mind to God. 



















"I once met a relative of Keshab Sen, fifty years old. He was playing cards. As if the time had 










not yet come for him to think of God! 



















"There is another characteristic of the bound soul. If you remove him from his worldly 










surroundings to a spiritual environment, he will pine away. The worm that grows in filth feels very 










happy there. It thrives in filth. It will die if you put it in a pot of rice." 



















All remained silent. 



















BONDAGE REMOVED BY STRONG RENUNCIATION 



















VIJAY: "What must the bound soul's condition of mind be in order to achieve liberation?" 





































MASTER: "He can free himself from attachment to 'woman and gold' if, by the grace of God, 










he cultivates a spirit of strong renunciation. What is this strong renunciation? One who has only a 










mild spirit of renunciation says, 'Well, all will happen in the course of time; let me now simply 










repeat the name of God.' But a man possessed of a strong spirit of renunciation feels restless for 










God, as the mother feels for her own child. A man of strong renunciation seeks nothing but God. 










He regards the world as a deep well and feels as if he were going to be drowned in it. He looks on 










his relatives as venomous snakes; he wants to fly away from them. And he does go away. He never 










thinks, 'Let me first make some arrangement for my family and then I shall think of God.' He has 










great inward resolution. 



















PARABLE OF THE TWO FARMERS 



















"Let me tell you a story about strong renunciation. At one time there was a drought in a 










certain part of the country. The farmers began to cut long channels to bring water to their fields. 










One farmer was stubbornly determined. He took a vow that he would not stop digging until the 










channel connected his field with the river. He set to work. The time came for his bath, and his wife 










sent their daughter to him with oil. 'Father,' said the girl, 'it is already late. Rub your body with oil 










and take your bath.' 'Go away!' thundered the farmer. 'I have too much to do now.' It was past 










midday, and the farmer was still at work in his field. He didn't even think of his bath. Then his wife 










came and said: 'Why haven't you taken your bath? The food is getting cold. You overdo everything. 










You can finish the rest tomorrow or even today after dinner.' The farmer scolded her furiously and 










ran at her, spade in hand, crying: 'What? Have you no sense? There's no rain. The crops are dying. 










What will the children eat? You'll all starve to death. I have taken a vow not to think of bath and 










food today before I bring water to my field.' The wife saw his state of mind and ran away in fear. 










Through a whole day's back-breaking labour the farmer managed by evening to connect his field 










with the river. Then he sat down and watched the water flowing into his field with a murmuring 










sound. His mind was filled with peace and joy. He went home, called his wife, and said to her, 










'Now give me some oil and prepare me a smoke.' With serene mind he finished his bath and meal, 










and retired to bed, where he snored to his heart's content. The determination he showed is an 










example of strong renunciation. 



















"Now, there was another farmer who was also digging a channel to bring water to his field. 










His wife, too, came to the field and said to him: 'It's very late. Come home. It isn't necessary to 










overdo things.' The farmer didn't protest much, but put aside his spade and said to his wife, 'Well, 










I'll go home since you ask me to.' (All laugh) That man never succeeded in irrigating his field. This is 










a case of mild renunciation. 



















"As without strong determination the farmer cannot bring water to his field, so also without 










intense yearning a man cannot realize God. (To Vijay) Why don't you come here now as frequently 










as before?" 



















VIJAY: "Sir, I wish to very much, but I am not free. I have accepted work in the Brahmo 










Samaj." 





































ATTACHMENT TO "WOMAN" CREATES BONDAGE 



















MASTER: "It is 'woman and gold' that binds man and robs him of his freedom. It is woman 










that creates the need for gold. For woman one man becomes the slave of another, and so loses his 










freedom. Then he cannot act as he likes. 



















STORY OF GOVINDAJI S PRIESTS 



















"The priests in the temple of Govindaji at Jaipur were celibates at first, and at that time they 










had fiery natures. Once the King of Jaipur sent for them, but they didn't obey him. They said to the 










messenger, 'Ask the king to come to see us.' After consultation, the king and his ministers arranged 










marriages for them. From then on the king didn't have to send for them. They would come to him 










of themselves and say: 'Your Majesty, we have come with our blessings. Here are the sacred 










flowers of the temple. Deign to accept them.' They came to the palace, for now they always 










wanted money for one thing or another: the building of a house, the rice-taking ceremony of their 










babies, or the rituals connected with the beginning of their children's education. 



















STORY OF TWELVE HUNDRED NEDAS 



















"There is the story of the twelve hundred nedas and thirteen hundred nedis. Virabhadra, 










the son of Nityananda Goswami, had thirteen hundred 'shaven-headed' disciples. They attained 










great spiritual powers. That alarmed their teacher. 'My disciples have acquired great spiritual 










powers', thought Virabhadra. 'Whatever they say to people will come to pass. Wherever they go 










they may create alarming situations; for people offending them unwittingly will come to grief.' 










Thinking thus, Virabhadra one day called them to him and said, 'See me after performing your 










daily devotions on the bank of the Ganges.' These disciples had such a high spiritual nature that, 










while meditating, they would go into samadhi and be unaware of the river water flowing over their 










heads during the flood-tide. Then the ebb-tide would come and still they would remain absorbed 










in meditation. 



















"Now, one hundred of these disciples had anticipated what their teacher would ask of 










them. Lest they should have to disobey his injunctions, they had quickly disappeared from the 










place before he summoned them. So they did not go to Virabhadra with the others. The remaining 










twelve hundred disciples went to the teacher after finishing their meditation. Virabhadra said to 










them: 'These thirteen hundred nuns will serve you. I ask you to marry them.' 'As you please, 










revered sir', they said. 'But one hundred of us have gone away.' Thenceforth each of these twelve 










hundred disciples had a wife. Consequently they all lost their spiritual power. Their austerities did 










not have their original fire. The company of woman robbed them of their spirituality because it 










destroyed their freedom. 



















DEGRADING EFFECT OF SERVING OTHERS 



















(To Vijay) "You yourself perceive how far you have gone down by being a servant of others. 










Again, one finds that people with many university degrees, scholars with their vast English 










education, accept service under their English masters and are daily trampled under their boots. 










The one cause of all this is woman. They have married and set up a 'gay fair' with their wives and 





































children. Now they cannot go back, much as they would like to. Hence all these insults and 










humiliations, all this suffering from slavery. 



















"Once a man realizes God through intense dispassion, he is no longer attached to woman. 










Even if he must lead the life of a householder, he is free from fear of and attachment to woman. 










Suppose there are two magnets, one big and the other small. Which one will attract the iron? The 










big one, of course. God is the big magnet. Compared to Him, woman is a small one. What can 










'woman' do?" 



















WORSHIPPING WOMAN AS DIVINE MOTHER 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, shall we hate women then?" 



















MASTER: "He who has realized God does not look upon a woman with the eye of lust; so he 










is not afraid of her. He perceives clearly that women are but so many aspects of the Divine 










Mother. He worships them all as the Mother Herself. 



















(To Vijay) "Come here now and then. I like to see you very much." 



















VIJAY: "I have to do my various duties in the Brahmo Samaj; that is why I can't always come 










here. But I shall visit you whenever I find it possible." 



















DIFFICULTIES OF PREACHING 



















MASTER (to Vijay): "The task of a religious teacher is indeed difficult. One cannot teach men 










without a direct command from God. People won't listen to you if you teach without such 










authority. Such teaching has no force behind it. One must first of all attain God through spiritual 










discipline or some other means. Thus armed with authority from God, one can deliver lectures. 



















"After receiving the command from God, one can be a teacher and give lectures anywhere. 










He who receives authority from God also receives power from Him. Only then can he perform the 










difficult task of a teacher. 



















"An insignificant tenant was once engaged in a lawsuit with a big landlord. People realized 










that there was a powerful man behind the tenant. Perhaps another big landlord was directing the 










case from behind. Man is an insignificant creature. He cannot fulfil the difficult task of a teacher 










without receiving power direct from God." 



















VIJAY: "Don't the teachings of the Brahmo Samaj bring men salvation?" 



















MASTER: "How is it ever possible for one man to liberate another from the bondage of the 










world? God alone, the Creator of this world-bewitching maya, can save men from maya. There is 










no other refuge but that great Teacher, Satchidananda. How is it ever possible for men who have 










not realized God or received His command, and who are not strengthened with divine strength, to 










save others from the prison-house of the world? 



















"One day as I was passing the Panchavati on my way to the pine-grove, I heard a bullfrog 










croaking. I thought it must have been seized by a snake. After some time, as I was coming back, I 










could still hear its terrified croaking. I looked to see what was the matter, and found that a 





































water-snake had seized it. The snake could neither swallow it nor give it up. So there was no end 










to the frog's suffering. I thought that had it been seized by a cobra it would have been silenced 










after three croaks at the most. As it was only a water-snake, both of them had to go through this 










agony. A man's ego is destroyed after three croaks, as it were, if he gets into the clutches of a real 










teacher. But if the teacher is an 'unripe' one, then both the teacher and the disciple undergo 










endless suffering. The disciple cannot get rid either of his ego or of the shackles of the world. If a 










disciple falls into the clutches of an incompetent teacher, he doesn't attain liberation." 



















EGO ALONE THE CAUSE OF BONDAGE 



















VIJAY: "Sir, why are we bound like this? Why don't we see God?" 



















MASTER: "Maya is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul. This egotism has covered 










everything like a veil. 'All troubles come to an end when the ego dies.' If by the grace of God a man 










but once realizes that he is not the doer, then he at once becomes a Jivanmukta. Though living in 










the body, he is liberated. He has nothing else to fear. 



















"This maya, that is to say, the ego, is like a cloud. The sun cannot be seen on account of a 










thin patch of cloud; when that disappears one sees the sun. If by the grace of the guru one's ego 










vanishes, then one sees God. 



















"Rama, who is God Himself, was only two and a half cubits ahead of Lakshmana. But 










Lakshmana couldn't see Him because Sita stood between them. Lakshmana may be compared to 










the jiva, and Sita to maya. Man cannot see God on account of the barrier of maya. Just look: I am 










creating a barrier in front of my face with this towel. Now you can't see me, even though I am so 










near. Likewise, God is the nearest of all, but we cannot see Him on account of this covering of 










maya. 



















MAYA CREATES UPADHIS 



















"The jiva is nothing but the embodiment of Satchidananda. But since maya, or ego, has 










created various upadhis, he has forgotten his real Self. 



















"Each upadhi changes man's nature. If he wears a fine black-bordered cloth, you will at once 










find him humming Nidhu Babu's love-songs. Then playing-cards and a walkingstick follow. If even a 










sickly man puts on high boots, he begins to whistle and climbs the stairs like an Englishman, 










jumping from one step to another. If a man but holds a pen in his hand, he scribbles on any paper 










he can get hold of-such is the power of the pen ! 



















"Money is also a great upadhi. The possession of money makes such a difference in a man! 










He is no longer the same person. A brahmin used to frequent the temple garden. Outwardly he 










was very modest. One day I went to Konnagar with Hriday. No sooner did we get off the boat than 










we noticed the brahmin seated on the bank of the Ganges. We thought he had been enjoying the 










fresh air. Looking at us, he said: 'Hello there, priest! How do you do?' I marked his tone and said to 










Hriday: 'The man must have got some money. That's why he talks that way.' Hriday laughed. 





































"A frog had a rupee, which he kept in his hole. One day an elephant was going over the 










hole, and the frog, coming out in a fit of anger, raised his foot, as if to kick the elephant, and said, 










'How dare you walk over my head?' Such is the pride that money begets! 



















"One can get rid of the ego after the attainment of Knowledge. On attaining Knowledge one 










goes into samadhi, and the ego disappears. But it is very difficult to obtain such Knowledge. 



















SEVEN PLANES OF THE MIND 



















"It is said in the Vedas that a man experiences samadhi when his mind ascends to the 










seventh plane. The ego can disappear only when one goes into samadhi. Where does the mind of a 










man ordinarily dwell? In the first three planes. These are at the organs of evacuation and 










generation, and at the navel. Then the mind is immersed only in worldliness, attached to 'woman 










and gold'. A man sees the light of God when his mind dwells in the plane of the heart. He sees the 










light and exclaims: 'Ah! What is this? What is this?' The next plane is at the throat. When the mind 










dwells there he likes to hear and talk only of God. When the mind ascends to the next plane, in the 










forehead, between the eyebrows, he sees the form of Satchidananda and desires to touch and 










embrace it. But he is unable to do so. It is like the light in a lantern, which you can see but cannot 










touch. You feel as if you were touching the light, but in reality you are not. When the mind reaches 










the seventh plane, then the ego vanishes completely and the man goes into samadhi." 



















INDESCRIBABILITY OF HIGHEST PLANE 



















VIJAY: "What does a man see when he attains the Knowledge of Brahman after reaching the 










seventh plane?" 



















MASTER: "What happens when the mind reaches the seventh plane cannot be described. 



















"Once a boat enters the 'black waters' of the ocean, it does not return. Nobody knows what 










happens to the boat after that. Therefore the boat cannot give us any information about the 










ocean. 



















"Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner did it enter the water 










than it melted. Now who could tell how deep the ocean was? That which could have told about its 










depth had melted. Reaching the seventh plane, the mind is annihilated; man goes into samadhi. 










What he feels then cannot be described in words. 



















The "wicked I" 



















"The T that makes one a worldly person and attaches one to 'woman and gold' is the 










'wicked I'. The intervention of this ego creates the difference between jiva and Atman. Water 










appears to be divided into two parts if one puts a stick across it. But in reality there is only one 










water. It appears as two on account of the stick. This T is the stick. Remove the stick and there 










remains only one water as before. 



















"Now, what is this 'wicked I'? It is the ego that says: 'What? Don't they know me? I have so 










much money! Who is wealthier than I?' If a thief robs such a man of only ten rupees, 





































first of all he wrings the money out of the thief, then he gives him a good beating. But the 










matter doesn't end there: the thief is handed over to the police and is eventually sent to jail. The 










'wicked I' says: 'What? Doesn't the rogue know whom he has robbed? To steal my ten rupees! 










How dare he?' " 



















VIJAY: "If without destroying the T a man cannot get rid of attachment to the world and 










consequently cannot experience samadhi, then it would be wise for him to follow the path of 










Brahmajnana to attain samadhi. If the T persists in the path of devotion, then one should rather 










choose the path of knowledge." 



















THE "SERVANT I" 



















MASTER: "It is true that one or two can get rid of the T through samadhi; but these cases 










are very rare. You may indulge in thousands of reasonings, but still the T comes back. You may cut 










the peepal-tree to the very root today, but you will notice a sprout springing up tomorrow. 










Therefore if the T must remain, let the rascal remain as the 'servant I'. As long as you live, you 










should say, '0 God, Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.' The T that feels, 'I am the servant 










of God, I am His devotee' does not injure one. Sweet things cause acidity of the stomach, no 










doubt, but sugar candy is an exception. 



















"The path of knowledge is very difficult. One cannot obtain Knowledge unless one gets rid 










of the feeling that one is the body. In the Kaliyuga the life of man is centred on food. He cannot get 










rid of the feeling that he is the body and the ego. Therefore the path of devotion is prescribed for 










this cycle. 



















This is an easy path. You will attain God if you sing His name and glories and pray to Him 










with a longing heart. There is not the least doubt about it. 



















"Suppose you draw a line on the surface of water with a bamboo stick. The water appears 










to be divided into two parts; but the line doesn't remain for any length of time. The 'servant I'or 










the 'devotee I' or the 'child I' is only a line drawn with the ego and is not real". 



















THE "EGO OF A DEVOTEE" 



















VIJAY (to the Master): "Sir, you ask us to renounce the 'wicked I'. Is there any harm in the 










'servant I'?" 



















MASTER: "The 'servant l'-that is, the feeling, 'I am the servant of God, I am the devotee of 










God'-does not injure one. On the contrary, it helps one to realize God." 



















VIJAY: "Well, sir, what becomes of the lust, anger, and other passions of one who keeps the 










'servant I'?" 



















MASTER: "If a man truly feels like that, then he has only the semblance of lust, anger, and 










the like. If, after attaining God, he looks on himself as the servant or the devotee of God, then he 










cannot injure anyone. By touching the philosopher's stone a sword is turned into gold. It keeps the 










appearance of a sword but cannot injure. 





































"When the dry branch of a coconut palm drops to the ground, it leaves only a mark on the 










trunk indicating that once there was a branch at that place. In like manner, he who has attained 










God keeps only an appearance of ego; there remains in him only a semblance of anger and lust. 










He becomes like a child. A child has no attachment to the three gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas. 










He becomes as quickly detached from a thing as he becomes attached to it. You can cajole him out 










of a cloth worth five rupees with a doll worth an anna, though at first he may say with great 










determination: 'No, I won't give it to you. My daddy bought it for me.' Again, all persons are the 










same to a child. He has no feeling of high and low in regard to persons. So he doesn't discriminate 










about caste. If his mother tells him that a particular man should be regarded as an elder brother, 










the child will eat from the same plate with him, though the man may belong to the low caste of a 










blacksmith. The child doesn't know hate, or what is holy or unholy. 



















"Even after attaining samadhi, some retain the 'servant ego' or the 'devotee ego'. The 










bhakta keeps this 'l-consciousness'. He says, '0 God, Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant; 










Thou art the Lord and I am Thy devotee.' He feels that way even after the realization of God. His T 










is not completely effaced. Again, by constantly practising this kind of 'l-consciousness', one 










ultimately attains God. This is called bhaktiyoga. 



















"One can attain the Knowledge of Brahman, too, by following the path of bhakti. God is 










all-powerful. He may give His devotee Brahmajnana also, if He so wills. But the devotee generally 










doesn't seek the Knowledge of the Absolute. He would rather have the consciousness that God is 










the Master and he the servant, or that God is the Divine Mother and he the child." 



















VIJAY: "But those who discriminate according to the Vedanta philosophy also realize Him in 










the end, don't they?" 



















PATH OF BHAKTI IS EASY 



















MASTER: "Yes, one may reach Him by following the path of discrimination too: that is called 










Jnanayoga. But it is an extremely difficult path. I have told you already of the seven planes of 










consciousness. On reaching the seventh plane the mind goes into samadhi. If a man acquires the 










firm knowledge that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory, then his mind merges in 










samadhi. But in the Kaliyuga the life of a man depends entirely on food. How can he have the 










consciousness that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory? In the Kaliyuga it is difficult to 










have the feeling, 'I am not the body, I am not the mind, I am not the twenty-four cosmic principles; 










I am beyond pleasure and pain, I am above disease and grief, old age and death.' However you 










may reason and argue, the feeling that the body is identical with the soul will somehow crop up 










from an unexpected quarter. You may cut a peepal-tree to the ground and think it is dead to its 










very root, but the next morning you will find a new sprout shooting up from the dead stump. 










One cannot get rid of this identification with the body; therefore the path of bhakti is best for the 










people of the Kaliyuga. It is an easy path. 



















"And, 'I don't want to become sugar; I want to eat it.' I never feel like saying, 'I am 










Brahman.' I say, 'Thou art my Lord and I am Thy servant.' It is better to make the mind go up and 










down between the fifth and sixth planes, like a boat racing between two points. I don't want to go 










beyond the sixth plane and keep my mind a long time in the seventh. My desire is to sing the name 





































and glories of God. It is very good to look on God as the Master and oneself as His servant. Further, 










you see, people speak of the waves as belonging to the Ganges; but no one says that the Ganges 










belongs to the waves. The feeling, 'I am He', is not wholesome. A man who entertains such an idea, 










while looking on his body as the Self, causes himself great harm. He cannot go forward in spiritual 










life; he drags himself down. He deceives himself as well as others. He cannot understand his own 










state of mind. 



















PREMA-BHAKTI 



















"But it isn't any and every kind of bhakti that enables one to realize God. One cannot realize 










God without prema-bhakti. Another name for prema-bhakti is raga-bhakti. God cannot be realized 










without love and longing. Unless one has learnt to love God, one cannot realize Him. 



















"There is another kind of bhakti, known as vaidhi-bhakti, according to which one must 










repeat the name of God a fixed number of times, fast, make pilgrimages, worship God with 










prescribed offerings, make so many sacrifices, and so forth and so on. By continuing such practices 










a long time one gradually acquires raga-bhakti. God cannot be realized until one has raga-bhakti. 










One must love God. In order to realize God one must be completely free from worldliness and 










direct all of one's mind to Him. 



















"But some acquire raga-bhakti directly. It is innate in them. They have it from their very 










childhood. Even at an early age they weep for God. An instance of such bhakti is to be found in 










Prahlada. Vaidhi-bhakti is like moving a fan to make a breeze. One needs the fan to make the 










breeze. Similarly, one practises japa, austerity, and fasting, in order to acquire love of God. But 










the fan is set aside when the southern breeze blows of itself. Such actions as japa and austerity 










drop away when one spontaneously feels love and attachment for God. Who, indeed, will perform 










the ceremonies enjoined in the scriptures, when mad with love of God? 



















"Devotion to God may be said to be 'green' so long as it doesn't grow into love of God; but it 










becomes 'ripe' when it has grown into such love. 



















"A man with 'green' bhakti cannot assimilate spiritual talk and instruction; but one with 










'ripe' bhakti can. The image that falls on a photographic plate covered with black film5 is retained. 










On the other hand, thousands of images may be reflected on a bare piece of glass, but not one of 










them is retained. As the object moves away, the glass becomes the same as it was before. One 










cannot assimilate spiritual instruction unless one has already developed love of God." 



















VIJAY: "Is bhakti alone sufficient for the attainment of God, for His vision?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, one can see God through bhakti alone. But it must be 'ripe' bhakti, 










prema-bhakti and raga-bhakti. When one has that bhakti, one loves God even as the mother loves 










the child, the child the mother, or the wife the husband. 



















"When one has such love and attachment for God, one doesn't feel the attraction of maya 










to wife, children, relatives, and friends. One retains only compassion for them. To such a man the 










world appears a strange land, a place where he has merely to perform his duties. It is like a man's 










having his real home in the country, but coming to Calcutta for work; he has to rent a house in 





































Calcutta for the sake of his duties. When one develops love of God, one completely gets rid of 










one's attachment to the world and worldly wisdom. 



















"One cannot see God if one has even the slightest trace of worldliness. Match -sticks, if 










damp, won't strike fire though you rub a thousand of them against the match-box. You only waste 










a heap of sticks. The mind soaked in worldliness is such a damp matchstick. Once Sri Radha said to 










her friends that she saw Krishna everywhere-both within and without. The friends answered: 










'Why, we don't see Him at all. Are you delirious?' Radha said, 'Friends, paint your eyes with the 










collyrium of divine love, and then you will see Him.' 



















(To Vijay) "It is said in a song of your Brahmo Samaj: 



















Lord, is it ever possible to know Thee without love, however much one may perform 










worship and sacrifice? 



















"If the devotee but once feels this attachment and ecstatic love for God, this mature 










devotion and longing, then he sees God in both His aspects, with form and without form." 



















PURITY OF HEART 



















VIJAY: "How can one see God?" MASTER: "One cannot see God without purity of heart. 










Through attachment to 'woman and gold' the mind has become stained-covered with dirt, as it 










were. A magnet cannot attract a needle if the needle is covered with mud. Wash away the mud 










and the magnet will draw it. Likewise, the dirt of the mind can be washed away with the tears of 










our eyes. This stain is removed if one sheds tears of repentance and says, '0 God, I shall never 










again do such a thing.' Thereupon God, who is like the magnet, draws to Himself the mind, which is 










like the needle. Then the devotee goes into samadhi and obtains the vision of God. 



















GOD'S GRACE IS THE ULTIMATE HELP 



















"You may try thousands of times, but nothing can be achieved without God's grace. One 










cannot see God without His grace. Is it an easy thing to receive the grace of God? One must 










altogether renounce egotism; one cannot see God as long as one feels, 'I am the doer.' Suppose, in 










a family, a man has taken charge of the store-room; then if someone asks the master, 'Sir, will you 










yourself kindly give me something from the store-room?', the master says to him: 'There is already 










someone in the store-room. What can I do there?' 



















"God doesn't easily appear in the heart of a man who feels himself to be his own master. 










But God can be seen the moment His grace descends. He is the Sun of Knowledge. One single ray 










of His has illumined the world with the light of knowledge. That is how we are able to see one 










another and acquire varied knowledge. One can see God only if He turns His light toward His own 










face. 



















"The police sergeant goes his rounds in the dark of night with a Iantern6 in his hand. No one 










sees his face; but with the help of that light the sergeant sees everybody's face, and others, too, 










can see one another. If you want to see the sergeant, however, you must pray to him: 'Sir, please 





































turn the light on your own face. Let me see you.' In the same way one must pray to God: '0 Lord, 










be gracious and turn the light of knowledge on Thyself, that I may see Thy face.' 



















"A house without light indicates poverty. So one must light the lamp of Knowledge in one's 










heart. As it is said in a song: 



















Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart, Behold the face of the 










Mother, Brahman's Embodiment." 



















As Vijay had brought medicine with him, the Master asked a devotee to give him some 










water. He was indeed a fountain of infinite compassion. He had arranged for Vijay's boat fare, 










since the latter was too poor to pay it. Vijay, Balaram, M., and the other devotees left for Calcutta 










in a country boat. 



















Monday, January 1, 1883 



















At eight o'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna was seated on a mat spread on the floor of 










his room at Dakshineswar. Since it was a cold day, he had wrapped his body in his moleskin shawl. 










Prankrishna and M. were seated in front of him. Rakhal, too, was in the room. Prankrishna was a 










high government official and lived in Calcutta. Since he had had no offspring by his first wife, with 










her permission he had married a second time. By the second wife he had a son. Because he was 










rather stout, the Master addressed him now and then as "the fat brahmin". He had great respect 










for Sri Ramakrishna. Though a householder, Prankrishna studied the Vedanta and had been heard 










to say: "Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. I am He." The Master used to say to him: "In 










the Kaliyuga the life of a man depends on food. The path of devotion prescribed by Narada is best 










for this age." 



















A devotee had brought a basket of jilipi for the Master, which the latter kept by his side. 










Eating a bit of the sweets, he said to Prankrishna with a smile: "You see, I chant the name of the 










Divine Mother; so I get all these good things to eat. (Laughter.) But She doesn't give such fruits as 










gourd or pumpkin. She bestows the fruit of Amrita, Immortality-knowledge, love, discrimination, 










renunciation, and so forth." 



















A boy six or seven years old entered the room. The Master himself became like a child. He 










covered the contents of the basket with the palm or his hand, as a child does to conceal sweets 










from another child lest the latter should snatch them. Then he put the basket aside. 



















Suddenly the Master went into samadhi and sat thus a long time. His body was transfixed, 










his eyes wide open and unwinking, his breathing hardly perceptible. After a long time he drew a 










deep breath, indicating his return to the world of sense. 



















VISION OF DIVINE MOTHER 



















MASTER (to Prankrishna): "My Divine Mother is not only formless, She has forms as well. 










One can see Her forms. One can behold Her incomparable beauty through feeling and love. The 










Mother reveals Herself to Her devotees in different forms. 





































"I saw Her yesterday. She was clad in a seamless ochre-coloured garment, and She talked 










with me. 



















"She came to me another day as a Mussalman girl six or seven years old. She had a tilak on 










her forehead and was naked. She walked with me, joking and frisking like a child. 



















"At Hriday's house I had a vision of Gauranga. He wore a black-bordered cloth. 



















"Haladhari used to say that God is beyond both Being and Non-being. I told the Mother 










about it and asked Her, 'Then is the divine form an illusion?' The Divine Mother appeared to me in 










the form of Rati's mother and said, 'Do thou remain in Bhava' I repeated this to Haladhari. Now 










and then I forget Her command and suffer. Once I broke my teeth because I didn't remain in 










bhava. So I shall remain in bhava unless I receive a revelation from heaven or have a direct 










experience to the contrary. I shall follow the path of love. What do you say?" 



















PRANKRISHNA: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "But why should I ask you about it? There is Someone within me who does all 










these things through me. At times I used to remain in a mood of Godhood and would enjoy no 










peace of mind unless I was being worshipped. 



















"I am the machine and God is the Operator. I act as He makes me act. I speak as He makes 










me speak. Keep your raft, says Ramprasad, afloat on the sea of life, Drifting up with the 










flood-tide, drifting down with the ebb. 



















"It is like the cast-off leaf before a gale; sometimes it is blown to a good place and 










sometimes into the gutter, according to the direction of the wind. 



















"As the weaver said in the story: 'The robbery was committed by the will of Rama, I was 










arrested by the police by the will of Rama, and again, by the will of Rama, I was set free.' 



















"Hanuman once said to Rama: '0 Rama, I have taken refuge in Thee. Bless me that I may 










have pure devotion to Thy Lotus Feet and that I may not be caught in the spell of Thy 










world-bewitching maya.' 



















"Once a dying bullfrog said to Rama: '0 Rama, when caught by a snake I cry for Your 










protection. But now I am about to die, struck by Your arrow. Hence I am silent.' 



















GOD'S NATURE LIKE THAT OF A CHILD 



















"I used to see God directly with these very eyes, just as I see you. Now I see divine visions in 










trance. "After realizing God a man becomes like a child. One acquires the nature of the object 










one meditates upon. The nature of God is like that of a child. As a child builds up his toy house and 










then breaks it down, so God acts while creating, preserving, and destroying the universe. 










Further, as the child is not under the control of any guna, so God is beyond the three gunas-sattva, 










rajas, and tamas. That is why paramahamsas keep five or ten children with them, that they may 










assume their nature." 





































Sitting on the floor in the room was a young man from Agarpara about twenty-two years 










old. Whenever he came to the temple garden, he would take the Master aside, by a sign, and 










whisper his thoughts to him. He was a new-comer. That day he was sitting on the floor near the 










Master. 



















MASTER (to the young man): "A man can change his nature by imitating another's 










character. He can get rid of a passion like lust by assuming the feminine mood. He gradually comes 










to act exactly like a woman. I have noticed that men who take female parts in the theatre speak 










like women or brush their teeth like women while bathing. Come again on a Tuesday or Saturday. 



















(To Prankrishna) "Brahman and Sakti are inseparable. Unless you accept Sakti, you will find 










the whole universe unreal-T, 'y° u '/ house, buildings, and family. The world stands solid because 










the Primordial Energy stands behind it. If there is no supporting pole, no framework can be made, 










and without the framework there can be no beautiful image of Durga. 



















"Without giving up worldliness a man cannot awaken his spiritual consciousness, nor can he 










realize God. He cannot but be a hypocrite as long as he has even a trace of worldly desire. God 










cannot be realized without guilelessness. 



















Cherish love within your heart; abandon cunning and deceit: Through service, worship, 










selflessness, does Rama's blessed vision come. 



















Even those engaged in worldly activities, such as office work or business, should hold to the 










truth. Truthfulness alone is the spiritual discipline in the Kaliyuga." 



















PRANKRISHNA: "Yes, sir. It is said in the Mahanirvana Tantra: '0 Goddess, this religion 










enjoins it upon one to be truthful, self-controlled, devoted to the welfare of others, unagitated, 










and compassionate.'" 



















MASTER: "Yes. But these ideas must be assimilated." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch. He was in an ecstatic mood and looked at 










Rakhal. Suddenly he was filled with the tender feeling of parental love toward his young disciple 










and spiritual child. Presently he went into samadhi. The devotees sat speechless, looking at the 










Master with wondering eyes. 



















Regaining partial consciousness, the Master said: "Why is my spiritual feeling kindled at the 










sight of Rakhal? The more you advance toward God, the less you will see of His glories and 










grandeur. The aspirant at first has a vision of the Goddess with ten arms; there is a great display of 










power in that image. The next vision is that of the Deity with two arms; there are no longer ten 










arms holding various weapons and missiles. Then the aspirant has a vision of Gopala, in which 










there is no trace of power. It is the form of a tender child. Beyond that there are other visions also. 










The aspirant then sees only Light. 



















"Reasoning and discrimination vanish after the attainment of God and communion with 










Him in samadhi. How long does a man reason and discriminate? As long as he is conscious of the 










manifold, as long as he is aware of the universe, of embodied beings, of T and 'you'. He becomes 










silent when he is truly aware of Unity. This was the case with Trailanga Swami. 





































"Have you watched a feast given to the brahmins? At first there is a great uproar. But the 










noise lessens as their stomachs become more and more filled with food. When the last course of 










curd and sweets is served, one hears only the sound 'soop, soop' as they scoop up the curd in their 










hands. There is no other sound. Next is the stage of sleepsamadhi. There is no more uproar. 



















(To M. and Prankrishna) "Many people talk of Brahmajnana, but their minds are always 










preoccupied with lower things: house, buildings, money, name, and sense pleasures. As long as 










you stand at the foot of the Monument,10 so long do you see horses, carriages, Englishmen, and 










Englishwomen. But when you climb to its top, you behold the sky and the ocean stretching to 










infinity. Then you do not enjoy buildings, carriages, horses, or men. They look like ants. 



















"All such things as attachment to the world and enthusiasm for 'woman and gold' disappear 










after the attainment of the Knowledge of Brahman. Then comes the cessation of all passions. 










When the log burns, it makes a crackling noise and one sees the flame. But when the burning is 










over and only ash remains, then no more noise is heard. Thirst disappears with the destruction of 










attachment. Finally comes peace. 



















"The nearer you come to God, the more you feel peace. Peace, peace, peace-supreme 










peace! The nearer you come to the Ganges, the more you feel its coolness. You will feel 










completely soothed when you plunge into the river. 



















"But the universe and its created beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles, all exist 










because God exists. Nothing remains if God is eliminated. The number increases if you put many 










zeros after the figure one; but the zeros don't have any value if the one is not there." 



















The Master continued: "There are some who come down, as it were, after attaining the 










Knowledge of Brahman-after samadhi-and retain the 'ego of Knowledge' or the 'ego of Devotion', 










just as there are people who, of their own sweet will, stay in the market-place after the market 










breaks up. This was the case with sages like Narada. They kept the 'ego of Devotion' for the 










purpose of teaching men. Sankaracharya kept the 'ego of Knowledge' for the same purpose. 



















"God cannot be realized if there is the slightest attachment to the things of the world. A 










thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if the tiniest fibre sticks out. 



















"The anger and lust of a man who has realized God are only appearances. They are like a 










burnt string. It looks like a string, but a mere puff blows it away. 



















"God is realized as soon as the mind becomes free from attachment. Whatever appears in 










the Pure Mind is the voice of God. That which is Pure Mind is also Pure Buddhi; that, again, is Pure 










Atman, because there is nothing pure but God. But in order to realize God one must go beyond 










dharma and adharma." 



















The Master sang in his melodious voice: 



















Come, let us go for a walk, mind, to Kali, the Wish-fulfilling Tree, And there beneath It 










gather the four fruits of life. . . . 





































Sri Ramakrishna went out on the southeast verandah of his room and sat down. Prankrishna 










and the other devotees accompanied him. Hazra, too, was sitting there. The Master said to 










Prankrishna with a smile: "Hazra is not a man to be trifled with. If one finds the big dargah here, 










then Hazra is the smaller dargah." All laughed at the Master's words. A certain gentleman, 










Navakumar by name, came to the door and stood there. At sight of the devotees he immediately 










left. "Oh! Egotism incarnate!" Sri Ramakrishna remarked. 



















About half past nine in the morning Prankrishna took leave of the Master. Soon afterwards 










a minstrel sang some devotional songs to the accompaniment of a stringed instrument. The 










Master was listening to the songs when Kedar Chatterji, a householder devotee, entered the room 










clad in his office clothes. He was a man of devotional temperament and cherished the attitude of 










the gopis of Vrindavan. Words about God would make him weep. 



















The sight of Kedar awakened in the Master's mind the episode of Vrindavan in Sri Krishna's 










life. Intoxicated with divine love, the Master stood up and sang, addressing Kedar: 



















Tell me, friend, how far is the grove Where Krishna, my Beloved, dwells? His fragrance 










reaches me even here; But I am tired and can walk no farther. . . . 



















Sri Ramakrishna assumed the attitude of Sri Radha to Krishna and went into deep samadhi 










while singing the song. He stood there, still as a picture on canvas, with tears of divine joy running 










down his cheeks. 



















Kedar knelt before the Master. Touching his feet, he chanted a hymn: 



















We worship the Brahman-Consciousness in the Lotus of the Heart, The Undifferentiated, 










who is adored by Hari, Hara, and Brahma; Who is attained by yogis in the depths of their 










meditation; The Scatterer of the fear of birth and death, The Essence of Knowledge and Truth, the 










Primal Seed of the world. 



















After a time the Master regained consciousness of the relative world. Soon Kedar took his 










leave and returned to his office in Calcutta. 



















At midday Ramlal brought the Master a plate of food that had been offered in the Kali 










temple. Like a child he ate a little of everything. 



















Later in the afternoon several Marwari devotees entered the Master's room, where Rakhal 










and M. also were seated. 



















A MARWARI DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the way?" 



















TWO WAYS OF GOD-REALIZATION 



















MASTER: "There are two ways. One is the path of discrimination, the other is that of love. 










Discrimination means to know the distinction between the Real and the unreal. God alone is the 










real and permanent Substance; all else is illusory and impermanent. The magician alone is real; his 










magic is illusory. This is discrimination. 





































"Discrimination and renunciation. Discrimination means to know the distinction between 










the Real and the unreal. Renunciation means to have dispassion for the things of the world. One 










cannot acquire them all of a sudden. They must be practised every day. One should renounce 










'woman and gold' mentally at first. Then, by the will of God, one can renounce it both mentally 










and outwardly. It is impossible to ask the people of Calcutta to renounce all for the sake of God. 










One has to tell them to renounce mentally. 



















CONSTANT PRACTICE URGED 



















"Through the discipline of constant practice one is able to give up attachment to 'woman 










and gold'. That is what the Gita says. By practice one acquires uncommon power of mind. Then 










one doesn't find it difficult to subdue the sense-organs and to bring anger, lust, and the like under 










control. Such a man behaves like a tortoise, which, once it has tucked in its limbs, never puts them 










out. You cannot make the tortoise put its limbs out again, though you chop it to pieces with an 










axe." 



















MARWARI DEVOTEE: "Revered sir, you just mentioned two paths. What is the other path?" 



















MASTER: "The path of bhakti, or zealous love of God. Weep for God in solitude, with a 










restless soul, and ask Him to reveal Himself to you. Cry to your Mother Syama with a real cry, 










mind ! And how can She hold Herself from you? " 



















MARWARI DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the meaning of the worship of the Personal God? And 










what is the meaning of God without form or attribute?" 



















MASTER: "As you recall your father by his photograph, so likewise the worship of the image 










reveals in a flash the nature of Reality. 



















"Do you know what God with form is like? Like bubbles rising on an expanse of water, 










various divine forms are seen to rise out of the Great Akasa of Consciousness. The Incarnation of 










God is one of these forms. The Primal Energy sports, as it were, through the activities of a Divine 










Incarnation. 



















"What is there in mere scholarship? God can be attained by crying to Him with a longing 










heart. There is no need to know many things. 



















"He who is an Acharya has to know different things. One needs a sword and shield to kill 










others; but to kill oneself, a needle or a nail-knife suffices. 



















"One ultimately discovers God by trying to know who this T is. Is this T the flesh, the bones, 










the blood, or the marrow? Is it the mind or the buddhi? Analysing thus, you realize at last that you 










are none of these. This is called the process of 'Neti, neti', 'Not this, not this'. One can neither 










comprehend nor touch the Atman. It is without qualities or attributes. 



















"But, according to the path of devotion, God has attributes. To a devotee Krishna is Spirit, 










His Abode is Spirit, and everything about Him is Spirit." 



















The Marwari devotees saluted the Master and took their leave. 





































At the approach of evening Sri Ramakrishna went out to look at the sacred river. The lamp 










was lighted in his room. The Master chanted the hallowed name of the Divine Mother and 










meditated on Her. Then the evening worship began in the various temples. 



















The sound of gongs, floating on the air, mingled with the murmuring voice of the river. 










Peace and blessedness reigned everywhere. 



















THE MASTER'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION AT DAKSHINESWAR 



















Sunday, February 18, 1883 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA arrived at Govinda Mukherji's house at Belgharia, near Calcutta. Besides 










Narendra, Ram, and other devotees, some of Govinda's neighbours were present. The Master first 










sang and danced with the devotees. After the kirtan they sat down. Many saluted the Master. 










Now and then he would say, "Bow before God." 



















Master's attitude toward the wicked 



















"It is God alone", he said, "who has become all this. But in certain places- for instance, in a 










holy man-there is a greater manifestation than in others. You may say, there are wicked men 










also. That is true, even as there are tigers and lions; but one need not hug the 'tiger God'. One 










should keep away from him and salute him from a distance. Take water, for instance. Some 










water may be drunk, some may be used for worship, some for bathing, and some only for washing 










dishes." 



















PATHS OF KNOWLEDGE AND DEVOTION 



















A NEIGHBOUR: "Revered sir, what are the doctrines of Vedanta?" MASTER: "The Vedantist 










says, 'I am He.' Brahman is real and the world illusory. Even the T is illusory. Only the Supreme 










Brahman exists. 



















"But the T cannot be got rid of. Therefore it is good to have the feeling, 'I am the servant of 










God, His son, His devotee.' 



















"For the Kali Yuga the path of bhakti is especially good. One can realize God through bhakti 










too. As long as one is conscious of the body, one is also conscious of objects. Form, taste, smell, 










sound, and touch-these are the objects. It is extremely difficult to get rid of the consciousness of 










objects. And one cannot realize 'I am He' as long as one is aware of objects. 



















"The sannyasi is very little conscious of worldly objects. But the householder is always 










engrossed in them. Therefore it is good for him to feel, 'I am the servant of God." 1 



















GOD'S NAME DESTROYS SIN 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Sir, we are sinners. What will happen to us?" MASTER: "All the sins of the 










body flyaway if one chants the name of God and sings His glories. The birds of sin dwell in the tree 










of the body. Singing the name of God is like clapping your hands. As, at a clap of the hands, the 










birds in the tree flyaway, so do our sins disappear at the chanting of God's name and glories. 





































"Again, you find that the water of a reservoir dug in a meadow is evaporated by the heat of 










the sun. Likewise, the water of the reservoir of sin is dried up by the singing of the name and 










glories of God. 



















"You must practise it every day. The other day, at the circus, I saw a horse running at top 










speed, with an Englishwoman standing on one foot on its back. How much she must have 










practised to acquire that skill! 



















"Weep at least once to see God. 



















"These, then, are the two means: practice and passionate attachment to God, that is to say, 










restlessness of the soul to see Him." 



















Sri Ramakrishna began his midday meal with the devotees. It was about one o'clock. A 










devotee sang in the courtyard below: 



















Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep In the lotus of the Muladhara! 










Fulfil Thy secret function, Mother: Rise to the thousand-petalled lotus within the head, Where 










mighty Siva has His dwelling; Swiftly pierce the six lotuses And take away my grief, Essence of 










Consciousness! 



















Hearing the song, Sri Ramakrishna went into samadhi; his whole body became still, and his 










hand remained touching the plate of food. He could eat no more. After a long time his mind came 










down partially to the plane of the sense world, and he said, "I want to go downstairs." A devotee 










led him down very carefully. Still in an abstracted mood, he sat near the singer. The song had 










ended. The Master said to him very humbly, "Sir, I want to hear the chanting of the Mother's name 










again." 



















The musician sang: 



















Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep In the lotus of the Muladhara! . . . 










The Master again went into ecstasy. 



















February 25, 1883 



















After his noon meal the Master conversed with the devotees. Ram, Kedar, Nityagopal, M., 










and others had arrived from Calcutta. Rakhal, Harish, Latu, and Hazra were living with the Master. 










Mr.Choudhury, who had three or four university degrees and was a government officer, was also 










present. He had recently lost his wife and had visited the Master several times for peace of mind. 



















MASTER (to Ram and the other devotees): "Devotees like Rakhal, Narendra, and Bhavanath 










may be called Nityasiddha. Their spiritual consciousness has been awake since their very birth. 










They assume human bodies only to impart spiritual illumination to others. 



















"There is another class of devotees, known as Kripasiddha, that is to say, those on whom 










the grace of God descends all of a sudden and who at once attain His vision and Knowledge. 










Such people may be likened to a room that has been dark a thousand years, which, when a lamp is 










brought into it, becomes light immediately, not little by little. 





































MYSTERY OF GOD'S WAYS 



















"Those who lead a householder's life should practise spiritual discipline; they should pray 










eagerly to God in solitude. (To Mr. Choudhury) God cannot be realized through scholarship. Who, 










indeed, can understand the things of the Spirit through reason? No, all should strive for devotion 










to the Lotus Feet of God. 



















"Infinite are the glories of God! How little can you fathom them! Can you ever find out the 










meaning of God's ways? 



















"Bhishma was none other than one of the eight Vasus, but even he shed tears on his bed of 










arrows. He said: 'How astonishing! God Himself is the companion of the Pandava brothers, and still 










there is no end to their troubles and sorrows!' Who can ever understand the ways of God? 



















"A man thinks, 'I have practised a little prayer and austerity; so I have gained a victory over 










others.' But victory and defeat lie with God. I have seen a prostitute dying in the Ganges and 










retaining consciousness to the end." 



















GOD-VISION THROUGH PURE LOVE 



















MR. CHOUDHURY: "How can one see God?" MASTER: "Not with these eyes. God gives one 










divine eyes; and only then can one behold Him. God gave Arjuna divine eyes so that he might see 










His Universal Form. 



















"Your philosophy is mere speculation. It only reasons. God cannot be realized that way. 



















"God cannot remain unmoved if you have raga-bhakti, that is, love of God with passionate 










attachment to Him. Do you know how fond God is of His devotees' love? It is like the cow's 










fondness for fodder mixed with oil-cake. The cow gobbles it down greedily. 



















"Raga-bhakti is pure love of God, a love that seeks God alone and not any worldly end. 










Prahlada had it. Suppose you go to a wealthy man every day, but you seek no favour of him; you 










simply love to see him. If he wants to show you favour, you say: 'No, sir. I don't need anything. I 










came just to see you.' Such is love of God for its own sake. You simply love God and don't want 










anything from Him, in return." 



















Saying this, the Master sang: 



















Though I am never loath to grant salvation, I hesitate indeed to grant pure love. Whoever 










wins pure love surpasses all; 



















He is adored by men; He triumphs over the three worlds. . . . 



















He continued, "The gist of the whole thing is that one must develop passionate yearning for 










God and practise discrimination and renunciation." 



















GURU AND ISHTA 



















MR. CHOUDHURY: "Sir, is it not possible to have the vision of God without the help of a 



















guru?" 





































MASTER: "Satchidananda Himself is the Guru. At the end of the Shavasadhana, just when 










the vision of the Ishta is about to take place, the guru appears before the aspirant and says to him, 










'Behold! There is your Ishta.' Saying this, the guru merges in the Ishta. He who is the guru is also 










the Ishta. The guru is the thread that leads to God. Women perform a ritualistic worship known as 










the 'Ananta-vrata', the object of worship being the Infinite. But actually the Deity worshipped is 










Vishnu. In Him are the 'infinite' forms of God. 



















(To Ram and the other devotees) "If you asked me which form of God you should meditate 










upon, I should say: Fix your attention on that form which appeals to you most; but know for 










certain that all forms are the forms of one God alone. 



















"Never harbour malice toward anyone. Siva, Kali, and Hari are but different forms of that 










One. He is blessed indeed who has known all as one. Outwardly he appears as Siva's devotee, But 










in his heart he worships Kali, the Blissful Mother, And with his tongue he chants aloud Lord Hari's 










name. 



















"The body does not endure without a trace of lust, anger, and the like. You should try to 










reduce them to a minimum." 



















Looking at Kedar, the Master said: "He is very nice. He accepts both the Absolute and the 










Relative. He believes in Brahman, but he also accepts the gods and Divine Incarnations in human 










form." 



















In Kedar's opinion Sri Ramakrishna was such an Incarnation. 



















Looking at Nityagopal, the Master said to the devotees, "He is in a lofty mood. 



















(To Nityagopal) "Don't go there too often. You may go once in a while. She may be a 










devotee, but she is a woman too. Therefore I warn you. 



















"The sannyasi must observe very strict discipline. He must not look even at the picture of a 










woman. But this rule doesn't apply to householders. An aspirant should not associate with a 










woman, even though she is very much devoted to God. A sannyasi, even though he may have 










subdued his passions, should follow this discipline to set an example to householders. 



















"Worldly people learn renunciation by seeing the complete renunciation of a monk; 










otherwise they sink more and more. A sannyasi is a world teacher." 



















Friday, March 9, 1883 Life of worldliness 



















About nine o'clock in the morning the Master was seated in his room with Rakhal, M., and a 










few other devotees. It was the day of the new moon. As usual with him on such days, Sri 










Ramakrishna entered again and again into communion with the Divine Mother. He said to the 










devotees: "God alone exists, and all else is unreal. The Divine Mother has kept all deluded by Her 










maya. Look at men. Most of them are entangled in worldliness. They suffer so much, but still they 










have the same attachment to 'woman and gold'. The camel eats thorny shrubs, and blood gushes 










from its mouth; still it will eat thorns. While suffering pain at the time of delivery, a woman says, 










'Ah ! I shall never go to my husband again.' But afterwards she forgets. 





































"The truth is that no one seeks God. There are people who eat the prickly leaves of the 










pineapple and not the fruit." 



















DEVOTEE: "Sir, why has God put us in the world?" 



















MASTER: "The world is the field of action. Through action one acquires knowledge. The 










guru instructs the disciple to perform certain works and refrain from others. Again, he advises the 










pupil to perform action without desiring the result. The impurity of the mind is destroyed through 










the performance of duty. It is like getting rid of a disease by means of medicine, under the 










instruction of a competent physician. 



















"Why doesn't God free us from the world? Ah, He will free us when the disease is cured. He 










will liberate us from the world when we are through with the enjoyment of 'woman and gold'. 










Once a man registers his name in the hospital, he cannot run away. The doctor will not let him go 










away unless his illness is completely cured." 



















MASTER'S LOVE FOR RAKHAL 



















During these days Sri Ramakrishna's heart overflowed with motherly love like the love 










Yasoda felt for Krishna. So he kept Rakhal with him. Rakhal felt toward the Master as a child feels 










toward its mother. He would sit leaning on the Master's lap as a young child leans on its mother 










while sucking her breast. 



















Rakhal was thus seated by the Master when a man entered the room and said that a high 










tide was coming in the Ganges. The Master and the devotees ran to the Panchavati to see it. At the 










sight of a boat being tossed by the tide, Sri Ramakrishna exclaimed: "Look! Look! I hope nothing 










happens to it." 



















They all sat in the Panchavati. The Master asked M. to explain the cause of the tide. M. 










drew on the ground the figures of the sun, moon, and earth and tried to explain gravitation, 










ebb-tide, flood-tide, new moon, full moon, eclipse, and so forth. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Stop it! I can't follow you. It makes me dizzy. My head is aching. Well, how 










can they know of things so far off? 



















"You see, during my childhood I could paint well; but arithmetic would make my head spin. 










I couldn't learn simple arithmetic." 



















Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room with the devotees. Looking at a picture of Yasoda, on 










the wall, he said: "It is not well done. She looks like a garland-seller." 



















ADHAR'S FIRST VISIT 



















The Master enjoyed a nap after his noon meal. Adhar and other devotees gradually 










gathered. This was Adhar's first visit. He was a deputy magistrate and about thirty years old. 





































MUCH REASONING CONDEMNED 



















ADHAR (to the Master): "Sir, I have a question to ask. Is it good to sacrifice animals before 










the Deity? It certainly involves killing." 



















MASTER: "The sastra prescribes sacrifice on special occasions. Such sacrifice is not harmful. 










Take, for instance, the sacrifice of a goat on the eighth day of the full or new moon. 



















"I am now in such a state of mind that I cannot watch a sacrifice. Also I cannot eat meat 










offered to the Divine Mother. Therefore I first touch my finger to it, then to my head, lest She 










should be angry with me. 



















"Again, in a certain state of mind I see God in all beings, even in an ant. At that time, if I see 










a living being die, I find consolation in the thought that it is the death of the body, the soul being 










beyond life and death. 



















"One should not reason too much; it is enough if one loves the Lotus Feet of the Mother. 










Too much reasoning throws the mind into confusion. You get clear water if you drink from the 










surface of a pool. Put your hand deeper and stir the water, and it becomes muddy. Therefore pray 










to God for devotion. 



















"Behind Dhruva's devotion there was desire. He practised austerities to gain his father's 










kingdom. But Prahlada's love for God was motiveless-a love that sought no return." 



















A DEVOTEE: "How can one realize God?" 



















MASTER: "Through that kind of love. But one must force one's demand on God. One should 










be able to say: '0 God, wilt Thou not reveal Thyself to me? I will cut my throat with a knife.' This is 










the tamas of bhakti." 



















DEVOTEE: "Can one see God?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, surely. One can see both aspects of God-God with form and without form. 










One can see God with form, the Embodiment of Spirit. Again, God can be directly perceived in a 










man with a tangible form. Seeing an Incarnation of God is the same as seeing God Himself. God 










is born on earth as man in every age." 



















March 11, 1883 Master's birthday celebration 



















It was Sri Ramakrishna's birthday. Many of his disciples and devotees wanted to celebrate 










the happy occasion at the Daksineswar temple garden. 



















From early morning the devotees streamed in, alone or in parties. After the morning 










worship in the temples sweet music was played in the nahabat. It was springtime. The trees, 










creepers, and plants were covered with new leaves and blossoms. The very air seemed laden with 










joy. And the hearts of the devotees were glad on this auspicious day. 



















M. arrived early in the morning and found the Master talking smilingly to Bhavanath, 










Rakhal, and Kalikrishna. M. prostrated himself before him. 





































MASTER (to M.): "I am glad you have come. 





































(To the devotees) "One cannot be spiritual as long as one has shame, hatred, or fear. Great 










will be the joy today. But those fools who will not sing or dance, mad with God's name, will never 










attain God. How can one feel any shame or fear when the names of God are sung? Now sing, all of 










you." 



















Bhavanath and his friend Kalikrishna sang: 



















Thrice blessed is this day of joy! May all of us unite, Lord, To preach Thy true religion here 










In India's holy land! Thou dwellest in each human heart; Thy name, resounding everywhere, fills 










the four corners of the sky. Today Thy devotees proclaim Thy boundless majesty. We seek not 










wealth or friends or fame, Lord! No other hope is ours. For Thee alone Thy devotees long with 










unflagging love. Safe at Thy feet, what fear have we of death or danger? We have found The Fount 










of Immortality. To Thee the victory, Lord! To Thee the victory! 



















As Sri Ramakrishna listened to the song with folded hands, his mind soared to a far-off 










realm. He remained absorbed in meditation a long time. After a while Kalikrishna whispered 










something to Bhavanath. Then he bowed before the Master and rose. Sri Ramakrishna was 










surprised. He asked, "Where are you going?" 



















BHAVANATH: "He is going away on a little business." 



















MASTER: "What is it about?" 



















BHAVANATH: "He is going to the Baranagore Workingmen's Institute." 



















MASTER: "It's his bad luck. A stream of bliss will flow here today. He could have enjoyed it. 










But how unlucky!" 



















Sri Ramakrishna did not feel well; so he decided not to bathe in the Ganges. About nine 










o'clock a few jars of water were taken from the river, and with the help of the devotees he finished 










his bath on the verandah east of his room. 



















After bathing, the Master put on a new wearing-cloth, all the while chanting the name of 










God. Accompanied by one or two disciples he walked across the courtyard to the temple of Kali, 










still chanting Her hallowed name. His eyes had an indrawn look, like that of a bird hatching her 










eggs. 



















On entering the temple, he prostrated himself before the image and worshipped the Divine 










Mother. But he did not observe any ritual of worship. Now he would offer flowers and 










sandal-paste at the feet of the image, and now he would put them on his own head. After finishing 










the worship in his own way, he asked Bhavanath to carry the green coconut that had been offered 










to the Mother. He also visited the images of Radha and Krishna in the Vishnu temple. 



















When the Master returned to his room, he found that other devotees had arrived, among 










them Ram, Nityagopal, and Kedar. They all saluted the Master, who greeted them cordially. 





































He asked Nityagopal, "Will you eat something now?" "Yes", the devotee answered. 










Nityagopal, who was twenty-three or twenty-four years old and unmarried, was like a child. His 










mind was always soaring in the spiritual realm. He visited the Master sometimes alone and 










sometimes in Ram's company. The Master had observed the spiritual state of his mind and had 










become very fond of him. He remarked now and then that Nityagopal was in the state of a 










paramahamsa. 



















WARNING TO MONKS 



















After Nityagopal had finished eating, the Master took him aside and gave him various 










instructions. 



















A certain woman, about thirty-one years old and a great devotee, often visited Sri 










Ramakrishna and held him in high respect. She had been much impressed by Nityagopal's spiritual 










state and, looking upon him as her own son, often invited him to her house. 



















MASTER (to Nityagopal): "Do you go there?" 



















NITYAGOPAL (like a child): "Yes, I do. She takes me". 



















MASTER: "Beware, holy man! Go there once in a great while, but not frequently; otherwise 










you will slip from the ideal. Maya is nothing but 'woman and gold'. A holy man must live away from 










woman. All sink there. 'Even Brahma and Vishnu struggle for life in that whirlpool.' " 



















Nityagopal listened to these words attentively. 



















M. (to himself): "How strange! This young man has developed the state of a paramahamsa. 










That is what the Master says now and then. Is there still a possibility of his falling into danger in 










spite of his high spiritual state? What an austere rule is laid down for a sadhu! He may slip from his 










ideal by associating intimately with women. How can an ordinary man expect to attain liberation 










unless such a high ideal is set by holy men? The woman in question is very devout; but still there is 










danger. Now I understand why Chaitanya punished his disciple, the younger Haridas, so severely. 










In spite of his teacher's prohibition, Haridas conversed with a widow devotee. But he was a 










sannyasi. Therefore Chaitanya banished him. What a severe punishment! How hard is the rule for 










one who has accepted the life of renunciation! Again, what love the Master cherishes for this 










devotee! He is warning him even now, lest he should run into danger in the future." 



















"Beware, holy man!" These words of the Master echoed in the hearts of the devotees, like 










the distant rumbling of thunder. 



















The Master went with the devotees to the northeast verandah of his room. Among them 










was a householder from the village of Daksineswar, who studied Vedanta philosophy at home. 










He had been discussing Om with Kedar before the Master. He said, "This Eternal Word, the 










Anahata Sabda, is ever present both within and without." 



















MASTER: "But the Word is not enough. There must be something indicated by the Word. 










Can your name alone make me happy? Complete happiness is not possible for me unless I see 










you." 





































DEVOTEE: "That Eternal Word itself is Brahman." 



















MASTER (to Kedar): "Oh, don't you understand? He upholds the doctrine of the rishis of 










olden times. They once said to Rama: '0 Rama, we know You only as the son of Dasaratha. Let 










sages like Bharadvaja worship You as God Incarnate. We want to realize Brahman, the Indivisible 










Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.' At these words Rama smiled and went away." 



















KEDAR: "Those rishis could not recognize Rama as an Incarnation of God. They must have 










been fools," 



















MASTER (seriously): "Please don't say such a thing. People worship God according to their 










tastes and temperaments. The mother cooks the same fish differently for her children, that each 










one may have what suits his stomach. For some she cooks the rich dish of pilau. But not all the 










children can digest it. For those with weak stomachs she prepares soup. Some, again, like fried 










fish or pickled fish. It depends on one's taste. 



















INCARNATION OF GOD 



















"The rishis followed the path of jnana. Therefore they sought to realize Brahman, the 










Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. But those who follow the path of devotion seek an 










Incarnation of God, to enjoy the sweetness of bhakti. The darkness of the mind disappears when 










God is realized. In the Purana it is said that it was as if a hundred suns were shining when Rama 










entered the court. Why, then, weren't the courtiers burnt up? It was because the brilliance of 










Rama was not like that of a material object. As the lotus blooms when the sun rises, so the lotus of 










the heart of the people assembled in the court burst into blossom." 



















As the Master uttered these words, standing before the devotees, he suddenly fell into an 










ecstatic mood. His mind was withdrawn from external objects. No sooner did he say, "the lotus of 










the heart burst into blossom", than he went into deep samadhi. He stood motionless, his 










countenance beaming and his lips parted in a smile. 



















After a long time he returned to the normal consciousness of the world. He drew a long 










breath and repeatedly chanted the name of Rama, every word showering nectar into the hearts of 










the devotees. The Master sat down, the others seating themselves around him. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Ordinary people do not recognize the advent of an Incarnation 










of God. He comes in secret. Only a few of His intimate disciples can recognize Him. That Rama was 










both Brahman Absolute and a perfect Incarnation of God in human form was known only to twelve 










rishis. The other sages said to Him, 'Rama, we know You only as Dasaratha's son.' 



















"Can everyone comprehend Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute? 










He alone has attained perfect love of God who, having reached the Absolute, keeps himself in the 










realm of the Relative in order to enjoy the divine lila. A man can describe the ways and activities of 










the Queen if he has previously visited her in England. Only then will his description of the Queen 










be correct. Sages like Bharadvaja adored Rama and said: '0 Rama, You are nothing but the 










Indivisible Satchidananda. You have appeared before us as a human being, but You look like a man 





































because You have shrouded Yourself with Your own maya.' These rishis were great devotees of 










Rama: and had supreme love for God." 



















MASTER'S DIFFERENT SPIRITUAL MOODS 



















Presently some devotees from Konnagar arrived, singing kirtan to the accompaniment of 










drums and cymbals. As they reached the northeast verandah of Sri Ramakrishna's room, the 










Master joined in the music, dancing with them intoxicated with divine joy. 



















Now and then he went into samadhi, standing still as a statue. While he was in one of these 










states of divine unconsciousness, the devotees put thick garlands of jasmine around his neck. The 










enchanting form of the Master reminded the devotees of Chaitanya, another Incarnation of God. 










The Master passed alternately through three moods of divine consciousness: the inmost, when he 










completely lost all knowledge of the outer world; the semi-conscious, when he danced with the 










devotees in an ecstasy of love; and the conscious, when he joined them in loud singing. It was 










indeed a sight for the gods, to see the Master standing motionless in samadhi, with fragrant 










garlands hanging from his neck, his countenance beaming with love, and the devotees singing and 










dancing around him. 



















When it was time for his noon meal, Sri Ramakrishna put on a new yellow cloth and sat on 










the small couch. His golden complexion, blending with his yellow cloth, enchanted the eyes of the 










devotees. 



















After his meal Sri Ramakrishna rested a little on the small couch. Inside and outside his 










room crowded the devotees, among them Kedar, Suresh, Ram, Manomohan, Girindra, Rakhal, 










Bhavanath, and M. Rakhal's father was also present. 



















EFFICACY OF EARNEST JAPA 



















A Vaishnava goswami was seated in the room. The Master said to him: "Well, what do you 










say? What is the way?" 



















GOSWAMI: "Sir, the chanting of God's name is enough. The scriptures emphasize the 










sanctity of God's name for the Kaliyuga." 



















MASTER: "Yes, there is no doubt about the sanctity of God's name. But can a mere name 










achieve anything, without the yearning love of the devotee behind it? One should feel great 










restlessness of soul for the vision of God. Suppose a man repeats the name of God mechanically, 










while his mind is absorbed in 'woman and gold'. Can he achieve anything? Mere muttering of 










magic words doesn't cure one of the pain of a spider or scorpion sting. One must also apply the 










smoke of burning cow-dung." 



















GOSWAMI: "But what about Ajamila then? He was a great sinner; there was no sin he had 










not indulged in. But he uttered the name of Narayana on his death-bed, calling his son, who also 










had that name. And thus he was liberated." 



















MASTER: "Perhaps Ajamila had done many spiritual things in his past births. It is also said 










that he once practised austerity; besides, those were the last moments of his life. What is the use 





































of giving an elephant a bath? It will cover itself with dirt and dust again and become its former self. 










But if someone removes the dust from its body and gives it a bath just before it enters the stable, 










then the elephant remains clean. . 



















"Suppose a man becomes pure by chanting the holy name of God, but immediately 










afterwards commits many sins. He has no strength of mind. He doesn't take a vow not to repeat 










his sins. A bath in the Ganges undoubtedly absolves one of all sins; but what does that avail? They 










say that the sins perch on the trees along the bank of the Ganges. 



















No sooner does the man come back from the holy waters than the old sins jump on his 










shoulders from the trees. (All laugh.) The same old sins take possession of him again. He is hardly 










out of the water before they fall upon him. 



















"Therefore I say, chant the name of God, and with it pray to Him that you may have love for 










Him. Pray to God that your attachment to such transitory things as wealth, name, and creature 










comforts may become less and less every day. 



















DOGMATISM CONDEMNED 



















(To the goswami) "With sincerity and earnestness one can realize God through all religions. 










The Vaishnavas will realize God, and so will the Saktas, the Vedantists, and the Brahmos. The 










Mussalmans and Christians will realize Him too. All will certainly realize God if they are earnest and 










sincere. 



















"Some people indulge in quarrels, saying, 'One cannot attain anything unless one worships 










our Krishna', or, 'Nothing can be gained without the worship of Kali, our Divine Mother', or, 'One 










cannot be saved without accepting the Christian religion.' This is pure dogmatism. The dogmatist 










says, 'My religion alone is true, and the religions of others are false.' This is a bad attitude. God can 










be reached by different paths. 



















"Further, some say that God has form and is not formless. Thus they start quarrelling. A 










Vaishnava quarrels with a Vedantist. 



















"One can rightly speak of God only after one has seen Him. He who has seen God knows 










really and truly that God has form and that He is formless as well. He has many other aspects that 










cannot be described. 



















PARABLE OF THE ELEPHANT AND THE BLIND MEN 



















"Once some blind men chanced to come near an animal that someone told them was an 










elephant. They were asked what the elephant was like. The blind men began to feel its body. 










One of them said the elephant was like a pillar; he had touched only its leg. Another said it was like 










a winnowing-fan; he had touched only its ear. In this way the others, having touched its tail or 










belly, gave their different versions of the elephant. Just so, a man who has seen only one aspect of 










God limits God to that alone. It is his conviction that God cannot be anything else. 





































ILLUSTRATION OF THE OCEAN AND THE ICE 



















(To the goswami) "How can you say that the only truth about God is that He has form? It is 










undoubtedly true that God comes down to earth in a human form, as in the case of Krishna. And it 










is true as well that God reveals Himself to His devotees in various forms. But it is also true that God 










is formless; He is the Indivisible ExistenceKnowledge-Bliss Absolute. He has been described in the 










Vedas both as formless and as endowed with form. He is also described there both as attributeless 










and as endowed with attributes. 



















"Do you know what I mean? Satchidananda is like an infinite ocean. Intense cold freezes the 










water into ice, which floats on the ocean in blocks of various forms. 



















Likewise, through the cooling influence of bhakti, one sees forms of God in the Ocean of the 










Absolute. These forms are meant for the bhaktas, the lovers of God. But when the Sun of 










Knowledge rises, the ice melts; it becomes the same water it was before. Water above and water 










below, everywhere nothing but water. Therefore a prayer in the Bhagavata says: '0 Lord, Thou 










hast form, and Thou art also formless. Thou walkest before us, Lord, in the shape of a man; 










again, Thou hast been described in the Vedas as beyond words and thought.' 



















"But you may say that for certain devotees God assumes eternal forms. There are places in 










the ocean where the ice doesn't melt at all. It assumes the form of quartz." 



















KEDAR: "It is said in the Bhagavata that Vyasa asked God's forgiveness for his three 










transgressions. He said: '0 Lord, Thou art formless, but I have thought of Thee in my meditation as 










endowed with form; Thou art beyond speech, but I have sung Thee hymns; Thou art the 










All-pervading Spirit, but I have made pilgrimages to sacred places. Be gracious, Lord, and forgive 










these three transgressions of mine.'" 



















MASTER: "Yes, God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and 










formlessness. No one can limit Him." 



















Rakhal's father was sitting in the room. At that time Rakhal was staying with the Master. 










After his mother's death his father had married a second time. Now and then he came to 










Daksineswar because of Rakhal's being there. He did not raise much objection to his son's living 










with the Master. Being a wealthy man of the world, he was always involved in litigation. There 










were lawyers and deputy magistrates among Sri Ramakrishna's visitors. Rakhal's father found it 










profitable to cultivate their acquaintance, since he expected to be benefited by their counsels in 










worldly matters. 



















Now and then the Master cast a glance at Rakhal's father. It was his cherished desire that 










Rakhal should live with him permanently at Daksineswar. 



















RAKHAL'S INBORN SPIRITUAL NATURE 



















MASTER (to Rakhal's father and the devotees): "Ah, what a nice character Rakhal has 










developed! Look at his face and every now and then you will notice his lips moving. Inwardly he 










repeats the name of God, and so his lips move. 





































PARABLE OF THE HOMA BIRD 



















"Youngsters like him belong to the class of the ever-perfect. They are born with 










God-Consciousness. No sooner do they grow a little older than they realize the danger of coming in 










contact with the world. There is the parable of the Homa bird in the Vedas. The bird lives high up 










in the sky and never descends to earth. It lays its egg in the sky, and the egg begins to fall. But 










the bird lives in such a high region that the egg hatches while falling. The fledgling comes out and 










continues to fall. But it is still so high that while falling it grows wings and its eyes open. Then the 










young bird perceives that it is dashing down toward the earth and will be instantly killed. The 










moment it sees the ground, it turns and shoots up toward its mother in the sky. Then its one goal 










is to reach its mother. 



















"Youngsters like Rakhal are like that bird. From their very childhood they are afraid of the 










world, and their one thought is how to reach the Mother, how to realize God. 



















"You may ask, 'How is it possible for these boys, born of worldly parents and living among 










the worldly-minded, to develop such knowledge and devotion?' It can be explained. If a pea falls 










into a heap of dung, it germinates into a pea-plant none the less. The peas that grow on that plant 










serve many useful purposes. Because it was sown in dung, will it produce another kind of plant? 



















"Ah, what a sweet nature Rakhal has nowadays! And why shouldn't it be so? If the yam is a 










good one, its shoots also become good. (All laugh.) Like father like son." 



















M. (aside to Girindra): "How well he has explained God with and without form! Do the 










Vaishnavas believe only in God with form?" 



















GIRINDRA: "Perhaps so. They are one-sided." 



















M: "Did you understand what he meant by the 'eternal form' of God? That 'quartz'? I 










couldn't grasp it well." 



















MASTER (to M.): "Well, what are you talking about?" 



















M. and Girindra smiled and remained silent. 



















Later in the afternoon the devotees were singing in the Panchavati, where the Master 










joined them. They sang together in praise of the Divine Mother: 



















High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite, When came a blast 










of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth. Maya disturbed its even flight by bearing 










down upon one side, And I could make it rise no more. Entangled in the twisting string of love for 










children and for wife, Alas! my kite was rent in twain. 



















It lost its crest of wisdom soon and downward plunged as I let it go; How could it hope to fly 










again, when all its top was torn away? Though fastened with devotion's cord, it came to grief in 










playing here; Its six opponents worsted it. Now Nareschandra rues this game of smiles and tears, 










and thinks it better Never to have played at all. 



















The singing continued. Sri Ramakrishna danced with the devotees. They sang: 





































The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight To the blue lotus flower of Mother 










Syama's feet, The blue flower of the feet of Kali, Siva's Consort; Tasteless, to the bee, are the 










blossoms of desire. My Mother's feet are black, and black, too, is the bee; Black is made one with 










black! This much of the mystery My mortal eyes behold, then hastily retreat. But Kamalakanta's 










hopes are answered in the end; He swims in the Sea of Bliss, unmoved by joy or pain. 



















The kirtan went on: 



















Mother, what a machine is this that Thou hast made! What pranks Thou playest with this 










toy Three and a half cubits high! Hiding Thyself within, Thou holdest the guiding string; But the 










machine, not knowing it, Still believes it moves by itself. Whoever finds the Mother remains a 










machine no more; Yet some machines have even bound The Mother Herself with the string of 










Love. 



















It was a very happy day for all. 



















The Master, accompanied by M., was coming back to his room, when he met Trailokya, a 










Brahmo devotee, on the way. Trailokya bowed before the Master. 



















MASTER: "They are singing in the Panchavati. Won't you go there?" 



















TRAILOKYA: "What shall I do there?" 



















MASTER: "Why, you will enjoy the music." 



















TRAILOKYA: "I have been there already." 



















MASTER: "Well, well! That's good." 



















It was about six o'clock in the evening. The Master was sitting with the devotees on the 










southeast verandah of his room. 



















MASTER: "A holy man who has renounced the world will of course chant the name of God. 










That is only natural. He has no other duties to perform. If he meditates on God it shouldn't surprise 










anybody. On the other hand, if he fails to think of God or chant His holy name, then people will 










think ill of him. 



















"But it is a great deal to his credit if a householder utters the name of the Lord. Think of 










King Janaka. What courage he had, indeed! He fenced with two swords, the one of Knowledge and 










the other of work. He possessed the perfect Knowledge of Brahman and also was devoted to the 










duties of the world. An unchaste woman attends to the minutest duties of the world, but her mind 










always dwells on her paramour. 



















"The constant company of holy men is necessary. The holy man introduces one to God." 



















KEDAR: "Yes, sir. The great soul is born in the world for the redemption of humanity. He 










leads others to God, just as a locomotive engine takes along with it a long train of carriages. Or 










again, he is like a river or lake that quenches the thirst of many people." 





































The devotees were ready to return home. One by one they saluted the Master. At the sight 










of Bhavanath Sri Ramakrishna said: "Don't go away today. The very sight of you inspires me." 










Bhavanath had not yet entered into worldly life. A youth of twenty, he had a fair complexion and 










handsome features. He shed tears of joy on hearing the name of God. The Master looked on him 










as the embodiment of Narayana. 



















Thursday, March 29, 1883 



















The Master had taken a little rest after his noon meal, when a few devotees arrived from 










Calcutta, among them Amrita and the well-known singer of the Brahmo Samaj, Trailokya. 



















Rakhal was not feeling well. The Master was greatly worried about him and said to the 










devotees: "You see, Rakhal is not well. Will soda-water help him? What am I to do now? Rakhal, 










please take the prasad from the Jagannath temple." 



















Even as he spoke these words the Master underwent a strange transformation. He looked 










at Rakhal with the infinite tenderness of a mother and affectionately uttered the name of Govinda. 










Did he see in Rakhal the manifestation of God Himself? The disciple was a young boy of pure heart 










who had renounced all attraction to lust and greed. And Sri Ramakrishna was intoxicated day and 










night with love of God. At the sight of Rakhal his eyes expressed the tender feelings of a mother, a 










love like that which had filled the heart of Mother Yasoda at the sight of the Baby Krishna. The 










devotees gazed at the Master in wonder as he went into deep samadhi. As his soul soared into the 










realm of Divine Consciousness, his body became motionless, his eyes were fixed on the tip of his 










nose, and his breathing almost ceased. 



















RENUNCIATION, FALSE AND TRUE 



















An unknown Bengali, dressed in the ochre cloth of a monk, entered the room and sat on the 










floor. The Master's mind was coming down to the ordinary plane of consciousness. Presently he 










began to talk, though the spell of samadhi still lingered. 



















MASTER (at the sight of the ochre cloth): "Why this gerrua? Should one put on such a thing 










for a mere fancy? A man once said, 'I have exchanged the Chandi for a drum.' At first he used to 










sing the holy songs of the Chandi; now he beats the drum. (All laugh.) 



















"There are three or four varieties of renunciation. Afflicted with miseries at home, one may 










put on the ochre cloth of a monk; but that renunciation doesn't last long. Again, a man out of work 










puts on an ochre wearing-cloth and goes off to Benares. After three months he writes home: 'I 










have a job here. I shall come home in a few days. Don't worry about me.' Again, a man may have 










everything he wants. He lacks nothing, yet he does not enjoy his possessions. He weeps for God 










alone. That is real renunciation. 



















"No lie of any sort is good. A false garb, even though a holy one, is not good. If the outer 










garb does not correspond to the inner thought, it gradually brings ruin. Uttering false words or 










doing false deeds, one gradually loses all fear. Far better is the white cloth of a householder. 










Attachment to worldliness, occasional lapses from the ideal, and an outer garb of gerrua- how 










dreadful! 





































"It is not proper for a righteous person to tell a lie or do something false even in a dramatic 










performance. Once I went to Keshab's house to see the performance of a play called 










Nava-Vrindavan. They brought something on the stage which they called the 'Cross'. Another actor 










sprinkled water, which they said was the 'Water of Peace'. I saw a third actor staggering and 










reeling in the role of a drunkard." 



















A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "It was K-." 



















MASTER: "It is not good for a devotee to play such parts. It is bad for the mind to dwell on 










such subjects for a long while. The mind is like white linen fresh from the laundry; it takes the 










colour in which you dip it. If it is associated with falsehood for a long time, it will be stained with 










falsehood. 



















"Another day I went to Keshab's house to see the play called Nimai Sannyas. Some flattering 










disciples of Keshab spoiled the whole performance. One of them said to Keshab, 'You are the 










Chaitanya of the Kaliyuga.' Keshab pointed to me and asked with a smile, 'Then who is he?' I 










replied: 'Why, I am the servant of your servant. I am a speck of the dust of your feet.' Keshab had a 










desire for name and fame. 



















(To Amrita and Trailokya) "Youngsters like Narendra and Rakhal are ever-perfect. Every time 










they are born they are devoted to God. An ordinary man acquires a little devotion after austerities 










and a hard struggle. But these boys have love of God from the very moment of their birth. They 










are like the natural image of Siva, which springs forth from the earth and is not set up by human 










hands. 



















NATURE OF THE EVER-PERFECT 



















"The ever-perfect form a class by themselves. Not all birds have crooked beaks. The 










ever-perfect are never attached to the world. There is the instance of Prahlada. 



















"Ordinary people practise spiritual discipline and cultivate devotion to God; but they also 










become attached to the world and are caught in the glamour of 'woman and gold'. They are like 










flies, which sit on a flower or a sweetmeat and light on filth as well. 



















"But the ever-perfect are like bees, which light only on flowers and sip the honey. The 










ever-perfect drink only the Nectar of Divine Bliss. They are never inclined to worldly pleasures. 



















"The devotion of the ever-perfect is not like the ordinary devotion that one acquires as a 










result of strenuous spiritual discipline. Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God 










and performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a rice-field in a roundabout way 










along the balk. Again, it is like reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a 










winding river. 



















"One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one develops ragabhakti, 










when one loves God as one's own. Then it is like crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don't 










have to walk along the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction. 





































"When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn't have to follow the winding 










river. Then the fields are deep under water. You can row your boat straight to the village. 



















"Without this intense attachment, this passionate love, one cannot realize God." 



















MASTER'S EXPERIENCES IN SAMADHI 



















AMRITA: "Sir, how do you feel in samadhi?" 



















MASTER: "You may have heard that the cockroach, by intently meditating on the Bhramara, 










is transformed into a Bhramara. Do you know how I feel then? I feel like a fish released from a pot 










into the water of the Ganges." 



















AMRITA: "Don't you feel at that time even a trace of ego?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, generally a little of it remains. However hard you may rub a grain of gold 










against a grindstone, still a bit of it always remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is 










like one of its sparks. In samadhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God generally keeps a 










little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine communion. Enjoyment is possible only when 










T and 'you' remain. 



















"Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of T. Then one experiences jada samadhi or 










nirvikalpa samadhi. That experience cannot be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of 










the ocean, but before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely one with 










the water of the ocean. Then who was to come back and tell the ocean's depth?" 



















ADVICE TO THE BRAHMOS 



















Saturday, April 7, 1883 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was visiting Balaram in Calcutta, with Narendra, Bhavanath, Rakhal, M., 










and others. Balaram, at the Master's bidding, had invited some of the young devotees to lunch. 










Sri Ramakrishna often said to him, "Feed them now and then; that will confer on you the merit of 










feeding holy men." The Master looked on his young disciples, yet untouched by "woman and 










gold", as veritable embodiments of God. 



















A few days earlier Sri Ramakrishna had been to Keshab's house with Narendra and Rakhal to 










see a performance of the play entitled Nava-Vrindavan. Narendra had taken part in the 










performance, in which Keshab had played the role of Pavhari Baba. 



















MASTER: "Keshab came on the stage in the role of a holy man and sprinkled the 'Water of 










Peace'. But I didn't like it. The idea of sprinkling such water on a theatrical stage after a 










performance! 



















"Another gentleman played the part of Sin. That is not good either. One should not commit 










sin; one should not even feign it." 



















Narendra's music 





































The Master wanted to hear Narendra sing. The young disciple was not feeling well, but at 










the Master's earnest request he sang to the accompaniment of the Tanpura: 



















Sing, bird that nestles deep within my heart! Sing, bird that sits on the Kalpa-Tree of 










Brahman! Sing God's everlasting praise. . . . 



















Then he sang: 



















Brahman, Joy of the whole universe, Supreme Effulgence; God beginningless, Lord of the 










world, the very Life of life! . .. 



















And again: 



















King of Kings, reveal Thyself to me! 



















1 crave Thy mercy. Cast on me Thy glance! 










At Thy dear feet I dedicate my life, 










Seared in the fiery furnace of this world. 










My heart, alas, is deeply stained with sin; 










Ensnared in maya, I am all but dead. 










Compassionate Lord! Revive my fainting soul 



















With the life-giving nectar of Thy grace. Narendra continued: 



















Upon the tray of the sky blaze bright the lamps of Sun and moon; Like diamonds shine the 










glittering stars To deck Thy wondrous form. The sweet Malaya breeze blows soft, for fragrant 










incense smoke; the moving air sways to and fro the fan before Thy holy face: Like gleaming votive 










lights the fresh and flowery groves appear. How wonderful Thy worship is, Slayer of birth and 










death! The sacred Om, from space arisen, is the resounding drum. My mind craves nectar day and 










night At Hari's Lotus Feet; Oh, shower the waters of Thy grace On thirsty Nanak, blessed Lord; And 










may Thy hallowed name Become his everlasting home! 



















He sang again: 



















In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full, And Love's flood-tide, in surging 










waves, is flowing everywhere. Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee! . . . 



















Then at the Master's bidding Bhavanath sang: 



















Where is a friend like Thee, Essence of Mercy? Where is another friend like Thee to stand 










by me through pain and pleasure? Who, among all my friends, forgives my failings, bringing me 










comfort for my grief, Soothing my spirit in its terror? Thou art the Helmsman who dost steer life's 










craft across the world's perilous sea; Thy grace it is alone, Lord, That silences my raging passions' 










storm. Thou pourest out the waters of peace upon my burning, penitent soul: And Thine is the 










bosom that will shelter me when every other friend I own Deserts me in my dying hour. 





































TRUE RENUNCIATION 



















Narendra said to the Master with a smile, referring to Bhavanath, "He has given up fish and 










betel-leaf." 



















MASTER: "Why so? What is the matter with fish and betel-leaf? They aren't harmful. The 










renunciation of 'woman and gold' is the true renunciation. 



















"Where is Rakhal?" 



















A DEVOTEE: "He is asleep, sir." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Once a man went to a certain place to see a theatrical 










performance, carrying a mat under his arm. Hearing that it would be some time before the 










performance began, he spread the mat on the floor and fell asleep. When he woke up it was all 










over. (All laugh.) Then he returned home with the mat under his arm." 



















Ramdayal was very ill and lay in bed in another room. The Master went there to inquire 










about him. 



















About four o'clock in the afternoon some members of the Brahmo Samaj arrived. The 










Master began to converse with them. 



















Study of scriptures for the beginner 



















A BRAHMO: "Sir, have you read the Panchadasi?" 



















MASTER: "At first one should hear books like that and indulge in reasoning. But later on- 



















Cherish my precious Mother Syama Tenderly within, mind; May you and I alone behold 










Her, Letting no one else intrude. 



















"One should hear the scriptures during the early stages of spiritual discipline. After attaining 










God there is no lack of knowledge. Then the Divine Mother supplies it without fail. 



















"A child spells out every word as he writes, but later on he writes fluently. 



















"The goldsmith is up and doing while melting gold. As long as the gold hasn't melted, he 










works the bellows with one hand, moves the fan with the other, and blows through a pipe with his 










mouth. But the moment the gold melts and is poured into the mould, he is relieved of all 










anxiety. 



















"Mere reading of the scriptures is not enough. A person cannot understand the true 










significance of the scriptures if he is attached to the world. Though with intense delight I learnt 










many poems and dramas, I have forgotten them all, entrapped in Krishna's love. 



















"Keshab enjoys the world and practises yoga as well. Living in the world, he directs his mind 










to God." 



















A devotee described the Convocation of Calcutta University, saying that the meeting looked 










like a forest of human heads. 





































MASTER: "The feeling of the Divine is awakened in me when I see a great crowd of people. 










Had I seen that meeting, I should have been overwhelmed with spiritual fervour." 



















Sunday, April 8, 1883 



















It was Sunday morning. The Master, looking like a boy, was seated in his room, and near 










him was another boy, his beloved disciple Rakhal. M. entered and saluted the Master. Ramlal also 










was in the room, and Kishori, Manilal Mallick, and several other devotees gathered by and by. 



















Manilal Mallick, a business man, had recently been to Benares, where he owned a 










bungalow. 



















TRAILANGA SWAMI AND BHASKARANANDA 



















MASTER: "So you have been to Benares. Did you see any holy men there?" 



















MANILAL: "Yes, sir. I paid my respects to Trailanga Swami, Bhaskarananda, and others." 










MASTER: "Tell us something about them." 



















MANILAL: "Trailanga Swami is living in the same temple where he lived before-on the 










Manikarnika Ghat; near the Benimadhav Minaret. People say he was formerly in a more exalted 










spiritual state. He could perform many miracles. Now he has lost much of that power." 



















MASTER: "That is the criticism of worldly people." 



















MANILAL: "Trailanga Swami keeps a strict vow of silence. Unlike him, Bhaskarananda is 










friendly with all." 



















MASTER: "Did you have any conversation with Bhaskarananda?" 



















MANILAL: "Yes, sir. We had a long talk. Among other things we discussed the problem of 










good and evil. He said to me: 'Don't follow the path of evil. Give up sinful thoughts. That is how 










God wants us to act. Perform only those duties that are virtuous.' " 



















The seer of God transcends good and evil 



















MASTER: "Yes, that is also a path, meant for worldly-minded people. But those whose 










spiritual consciousness has been awakened, who have realized that God alone is real and all else 










illusory, cherish a different ideal. They are aware that God alone is the Doer and others are His 










instruments. 



















"Those whose spiritual consciousness has been awakened never make a false step. They do 










not have to reason in order to shun evil. They are so full of love of God that whatever action they 










undertake is a good action. They are fully conscious that they are not the doers of their actions, 










but mere servants of God. They always feel: 'I am the machine and He is the Operator. I do as He 










does through me. I speak as He speaks through me. I move as He moves me.' 



















"Fully awakened souls are beyond virtue and vice. They realize that it is God who does 










everything. 





































SEEING GOD IN EVERYTHING 



















"There was a monastery in a certain place. The monks residing there went out daily to beg 










their food. One day a monk, while out for his alms, saw a landlord beating a man mercilessly. The 










compassionate monk stepped in and asked the landlord to stop. But the landlord was filled with 










anger and turned his wrath against the innocent monk. He beat the monk till he fell unconscious 










on the ground. Someone reported the matter to the monastery. The monks ran to the spot and 










found their brother lying there. Four or five of them carried him back and laid him on a bed. He 










was still unconscious. The other monks sat around him sad at heart; some were fanning him. 










Finally someone suggested that he should be given a little milk to drink. When it was poured into 










his mouth he regained consciousness. He opened his eyes and looked around. One of the monks 










said, 'Let us see whether he is fully conscious and can recognize us.' Shouting into his ear, he said, 










'Revered sir, who is giving you milk?' 'Brother,' replied the holy man in a low voice, 'He who beat 










me is now giving me milk.' 



















"But one does not attain such a state of mind without the realization of God." 



















MANUAL: "Sir, what you have just said applies to a man of a very lofty spiritual state. I 










talked on such topics in a general way with Bhaskarananda." 



















MASTER: "Does he live in a house?" 



















MANILAL: "Yes, sir. He lives with a devotee." 



















MASTER: "How old is he now?" 



















MANILAL: "About fifty-five." 



















MASTER: "Did you talk about anything else?" 



















MANILAL: "I asked him how to cultivate bhakti. He said: 'Chant the name of God. Repeat the 










name of Rama.' " 



















MASTER: "That is very good." 



















The worship was over in the temples and the bells rang for the food offerings in the shrines. 










As it was a summer noon the sun was very hot. The flood-tide began in the 



















Ganges and a breeze came up from the south. Sri Ramakrishna was resting in his room after 










his meal. 



















The people of Basirhat, Rakhal 's birth-place, had been suffering from a severe drought 










during the summer months. 



















MASTER (to Manilal): "Rakhal says that the people in his native village have been suffering 










seriously from a scarcity of water. Why don't you build a reservoir there? That will do the people 










good. (Smiling) You have so much money; what will you do with all your wealth? But they say that 










telis are very calculating." (All laugh.) 





































Manilal was truly a calculating man, though he suffered no lack of money. In later years he 










set up an endowment of twenty-five thousand rupees for the maintenance of poor students. 



















Manilal made no answer to these words of the Master about his caste characteristics. Later 










on, in the course of the conversation, he remarked casually: "Sir, you referred to a reservoir. You 










might as well have confined yourself to that suggestion. Why allude to the 'oil-man caste' and all 










that?" 



















Some of the devotees smiled to themselves. The Master laughed. 



















Presently a few elderly members of the Brahmo Samaj arrived. The room was full of 










devotees. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed, facing the north. He kept smiling, and talked to 










the Brahmo devotees in a joyous mood. 



















CHARACTERISTICS OF DIVINE LOVE 



















MASTER: "You talk glibly about prema. But is it such a commonplace thing? There are two 










characteristics of prema. First, it makes one forget the world. So intense is one's love of God that 










one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic love; he 'took a wood for the 










sacred grove of Vrindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of the Jamuna'. Second, one has no 










feeling of 'my-ness' toward the body, which is so dear to man. One wholly gets rid of the feeling 










that the body is the soul. 



















INDICATIONS OF GOD-REALIZATION 



















"There are certain signs of God-realization. The man in whom longing for God manifests its 










glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are discrimination, 










dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the 










name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing in an 










aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek. 



















"The state of a servant's house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has decided to 










visit it. First, the rubbish and jungle around the house are cleared up. Second, the soot and dirt 










are removed from the rooms. Third, the courtyard, floors, and other places are swept clean. 










Finally the master himself sends various things to the house such as a carpet, a hubble-bubble for 










smoking, and the like. When you see these things arriving, you conclude that the master will very 










soon come" 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, should one first practise discrimination to attain self-control?" 



















MASTER: "That is also a path. It is called the path of vichara, reasoning. But the inner 










organs3 are brought under control naturally through the path of devotion as well. It is rather easily 










accomplished that way. Sense pleasures appear more and more tasteless as love for God grows. 










Can carnal pleasure attract a grief-stricken man and woman the day their child has died?" 



















EFFICACY OF JAPA AND PRAYER 



















DEVOTEE: "How can I develop love for God?" 





































MASTER: "Repeat His name, and sins will disappear. Thus you will destroy lust, anger, the 










desire for creature comforts, and so on." 



















DEVOTEE: "How can I take delight in God's name?" 



















MASTER: "Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name. He will 










certainly fulfil your heart's desire." 



















So saying, the Master sang a song in his sweet voice, pleading with the Divine Mother to 










show Her grace to suffering men: 



















Mother, I have no one else to blame: Alas! I sink in the well these very hands have dug. 










With the six passions for my spade, I dug a pit in the sacred land of earth; And now the dark water 










of death gushes forth! How can I save myself, my Redeemer? 



















Surely I have been my own enemy; How can I now ward off this dark water of death? 










Behold, the waters rise to my chest! How can I save myself? Mother, save me! Thou art my only 










Refuge; with Thy protecting glance Take me across to the other shore of the world. 



















The Master sang again: 



















What a delirious fever is this that I suffer from! Mother, Thy grace is my only cure. False 










pride is the fever that racks my wasted form; "I" and "mine" are my cry. Oh, what a wicked 










delusion! My quenchless thirst for wealth and friends is never-ceasing; How, then, shall I sustain 










my life? 



















Talk about things unreal, this is my wretched delirium, And I indulge in it always, Giver of 










all good fortune! My eyes in seeming sleep are closed, my stomach is filled With the vile worms of 










cruelty. Alas! I wander about absorbed in unmeaning deeds; Even for Thy holy name I have no 










taste, Mother! I doubt that I shall ever be cured of this malady. 



















Then the Master said: '"Even for Thy holy name I have no taste.' A typhoid patient has very 










little chance of recovery if he loses all taste for food; but his life need not be despaired of if he 










enjoys food even a little. That is why one should cultivate a taste for God's name. Any name will 










do-Durga, Krishna, or Siva. Then if, through the chanting of the name, one's attachment to God 










grows day by day, and joy fills the soul, one has nothing to fear. The delirium will certainly 










disappear; the grace of God will certainly descend. 



















PARABLE OF THE TWO FRIENDS 



















" 'As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain.' Once two friends were going along the street, 










when they saw some people listening to a reading of the Bhagavata. 'Come, friend', said the one to 










the other. 'Let us hear the sacred book.' So saying he went in and sat down. The second man 










peeped in and went away. He entered a house of ill fame. But very soon he felt disgusted with the 










place. 'Shame on me!' he said to himself. 'My friend has been listening to the sacred word of Hari; 










and see where I am!' But the friend who had been listening to the Bhagavata also became 










disgusted. 'What a fool I am!' he said. 'I have been listening to this fellow's blah-blah, and my 










friend is having a grand time.' In course of time they both died. The messenger of Death came for 





































the soul of the one who had listened to the Bhagavata and dragged it off to hell. The messenger of 










God came for the soul of the one who had been to the house of prostitution and led it up to 










heaven. 



















"Verily, the Lord looks into a man's heart and does not judge him by what he does or where 










he lives. 'Krishna accepts a devotee's inner feeling of love.' 



















"In the Kartabhaja sect, the teacher, while giving initiation, says to the disciple, 'Now 










everything depends on your mind.' According to this sect, 'He who has the right mind find the right 










way and also achieves the right end.' It was through the power of his mind that Hanuman leapt 










over the sea. 'I am the servant of Rama; I have repeated the holy name of Rama. Is there anything 










impossible for me?'-that was Hanuman's faith. 



















"Ignorance lasts as long as one has ego. There can be no liberation so long as the ego 










remains. '0 God, Thou art the Doer and not I'-that is knowledge. 



















"By being lowly one can rise high. The chatak bird makes its nest on low ground, but it soars 










very high in the sky. Cultivation is not possible on high land; in low land water accumulates and 










makes cultivation possible. 



















"One must take the trouble to seek the company of holy persons. In his own home a man 










hears only worldly talk; the disease of worldliness has become chronic with him. The caged parrot 










sitting on its perch repeats, 'Rama! Rama!' But let it fly to the forest and it will squawk in its usual 










way. 



















"Mere possession of money doesn't make a nobleman. One sign of the mansion of a 










nobleman is that all the rooms are lighted. The poor cannot afford much oil, and consequently 










cannot have so many lights. This shrine of the body should not be left dark; one should illumine it 










with the lamp of Wisdom. Lighting the lamp of knowledge in the chamber of your heart, Behold 










the face of the Mother, Brahman's Embodiment. 



















"Everyone can attain Knowledge. There are two entities: Jivatma, the individual soul, and 










Paramatma, the Supreme Soul. Through prayer all individual souls can be united to the Supreme 










Soul. Every house has a connection for gas, and gas can be obtained from the main storage-tank of 










the Gas Company. Apply to the Company, and it will arrange for your supply of gas. Then your 










house will be lighted. 



















"In some people spiritual consciousness has already been awakened; but they have special 










marks. They do not enjoy hearing or talking about anything but God. They are like the chatak, 










which prays for rain-water though the seven oceans, the Ganges, the Jamuna, and the rivers near 










it are all filled with water. It won't drink anything but rainwater, even though its throat is burning 










with thirst." 



















The Master wanted to hear a few songs. Ramlal and a brahmin official of the temple garden 



















sang: 



















Dwell, Lord, Lover of bhakti, In the Vrindavan of my heart, And my devotion unto Thee 










Will be Thy Radha, dearly loved. . . . 





































And again: 





































The dark cloud of the summer storm fades into nothingness, When, flute in hand and a 










smile on His lips, Lighting the world with His loveliness, Krishna, the Dark One, appears. 



















His dazzling yellow robe outgleams even the lightning's glare; A wreath of wild-flowers 










interwoven Gently swings from His youthful breast And softly kisses His feet. 



















See, there He stands, the Lord of life, the Moon of Nanda's line, Outshining all the moons in 










heaven And with the splendour of His rays Flooding the Jamuna's bank! 



















He stands there, stealing the maidens' hearts; He lures them from hearth and home. 










Krishna enters my own heart's shrine, And with His flute-note steals away My wisdom, life, and 










soul. To whom shall Ganga Narayana pour out his tale of woe? Ah, friend, you might have 










understood Had you but gone to the Jamuna's bank To fill your water-jar! 



















Again they sang: 



















High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite, When came a blast 










of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth. . . . 



















ZEAL FOR THE LORD DESTROYS SIN 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "As the tiger devours other animals, so does the 'tiger of zeal for 










the Lord' eat up lust, anger, and the other passions. Once this zeal grows in the heart, lust and the 










other passions disappear. The gopis of Vrindavan had that state of mind because of their zeal for 










Krishna. 



















"Again, this zeal for God is compared to collyrium. Radha said to her friends, 'I see Krishna 










everywhere.' They replied, 'Friend, you have painted your eyes with the collyrium of love; that is 










why you see Krishna everywhere.' 



















"They say that when your eyes are painted with collyrium made from the ashes of a frog's 










head you see snakes everywhere. 



















TRAITS OF BOUND SOULS 



















"They are indeed bound souls who constantly dwell with 'woman and gold' and do not think 










of God even for a moment. How can you expect noble deeds of them? They are like mangoes 










pecked by a crow, which may not be offered to the Deity in the temple, and which even men 










hesitate to eat. 



















"Bound souls, worldly people, are like silk-worms. The worms can cut through their cocoons 










if they want, but having woven the cocoons themselves, they are too much attached to them to 










leave them. And so they die there. 



















"Free souls are not under the control of 'woman and gold'. There are some silk-worms that 










cut through the cocoon they have made with such great care. But they are few and far between. 





































"It is maya that deludes. Only a few become spiritually awakened and are not deluded by 










the spell of maya. They do not come under the control of 'woman and gold'. 



















TWO CLASSES OF PERFECT SOULS 



















"There are two classes of perfect souls: those who attain perfection through spiritual 










practice, and those who attain it through the grace of God. Some farmers irrigate their fields with 










great labour. Only then can they grow crops. But there are some who do not have to irrigate at all; 










their fields are flooded by rain. They don't have to go to the trouble of drawing water. One must 










practise spiritual discipline laboriously, in order to avoid the clutches of maya. Those who attain 










liberation through the grace of God do not have to labour. But they are few indeed. 



















THE EVER-PERFECT 



















"Then there is the class of the ever-perfect. They are born in each life with their spiritual 










consciousness already awakened. Think of a spring whose outlet is obstructed. While looking after 










various things in the garden, the plumber accidentally clears it and the water gushes out. Yet 










people are amazed to see the first manifestations of an ever-perfect soul's zeal for God. They say, 










'Where was all this devotion and renunciation and love?'" 



















The conversation turned to the spiritual zeal of devotees, as illustrated in the earnestness of 










the gopis of Vrindavan. Ramlal sang: 



















Thou art my All in All, Lord !-the Life of my life, the Essence of essence; In the three worlds 










I have none else but Thee to call my own. Thou art my peace, my joy, my hope; Thou my support, 










my wealth, my glory; Thou my wisdom and my strength. Thou art my home, my place of rest; my 










dearest friend, my next of kin; My present and my future, Thou; my heaven and my salvation. 










Thou art my scriptures, my commandments; Thou art my ever gracious Guru; Thou the Spring of 










my boundless bliss. Thou art the Way, and Thou the Goal; Thou the Adorable One, Lord! Thou 










art the Mother tender-hearted; Thou the chastising Father; Thou the Creator and Protector; Thou 










the Helmsman who dost steer My craft across the sea of life. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Ah! What a beautiful song!-'Thou art my All in All.' " 



















Ramlal sang again, this time describing the pangs of the gopis on being separated from their 










beloved Krishna: 



















Hold not, hold not the chariot's wheels! Is it the wheels that make it move? The Mover of its 










wheels is Krishna, By whose will the worlds are moved. . . . 



















The Master went into deep samadhi. His body was motionless; he sat with folded hands as 










in his photograph. Tears of joy flowed from the corners of his eyes. After a long time his mind 










came down to the ordinary plane of consciousness. He mumbled something, of which only a word 










now and then could be heard by the devotees in the room. He was saying: "Thou art I, and I am 










Thou-Thou eatest-Thou-l eat! . . . What is this confusion Thou hast created?" 



















Continuing, the Master said: "I see everything like a man with jaundiced eyes! I see Thee 










alone everywhere. Krishna, Friend of the lowly! Eternal Consort of my soul! Govinda!" 





































As he uttered the words "Eternal Consort of my soul" and "Govinda", the Master again went 










into samadhi. There was complete silence in the room. The eager and unsatiated eyes of the 










devotees were fixed on the Master, a God-man of infinite moods. 



















Adhar Sen arrived with several of his friends. He was a deputy magistrate, about thirty years 










old. This was his second visit to the Master. He was accompanied by his friend Saradacharan, who 










was extremely unhappy because of the death of his eldest son. A retired deputy inspector of 










schools, Saradacharan devoted himself to meditation and prayer. Adhar had brought his friend to 










the Master for consolation in his afflicted state of mind. 



















Coming down from samadhi, the Master found the eyes of the devotees fixed on him. He 










muttered to himself, still in an abstracted mood. 



















WORLDLY PEOPLE'S LACK PERSEVERANCE 



















Then, addressing the devotees, Sri Ramakrishna said: "The spiritual wisdom of worldly 










people is seen only on rare occasions. It is like the flame of a candle. No, it is rather like a single ray 










of the sun passing through a chink in a wall. Worldly people chant the name of God, but there is no 










zeal behind it. It is like children's swearing by God, having learnt the word from the quarrels of 










their aunts. 



















"Worldly people have no grit. If they succeed in an undertaking, it is all right, but if they 










don't succeed, it scarcely bothers them at all. When they need water, they begin to dig a well. But 










as soon as they strike a stone, they give up digging there and begin at another place. Perhaps they 










come to a bed of sand. Finding nothing but sand, they give that place up too. How can they 










succeed in getting water unless they continue to dig persistently where they started? 



















"Man reaps the harvest of his own past actions. Hence you read in the song: 



















Mother, I have no one else to blame: Alas! I sink in the well these very hands have dug. 



















"T and 'mine'-that is ignorance. By discriminating you will realize that what you call T is 










really nothing but Atman. Reason it out. Are you the body or the flesh or something else? At the 










end you will know that you are none of these. You are free from attributes. Then you will realize 










that you have never been the doer of any action, that you have been free from virtue and faults 










alike, that you are beyond righteousness and unrighteousness. 



















"From ignorance a man says, 'This is gold and this is brass.' But a man of Knowledge says, 'It 










is all gold.' 



















"Reasoning stops when one sees God. But there are instances of people who have realized 










God and who still continue to reason. Again, there are people who, even after having seen God, 










chant His name with devotion and sing His glories. 



















"How long does a child cry? So long as it is not sucking at its mother's breast. As soon as it is 










nursed it stops crying. Then the child feels only joy. Joyously it drinks the milk from its mother's 










breast. But it is also true that, while drinking, the child sometimes plays and laughs. 





































"It is God alone who has become everything. But in man He manifests Himself the most. 










God is directly present in the man who has the pure heart of a child and who laughs and cries and 










dances and sings in divine ecstasy." 



















By this time Sri Ramakrishna had become better acquainted with Adhar, who related the 










cause of his friend's grief. The Master sang, as if to himself: 



















To arms! To arms, man! Death storms your house in battle array! Bearing the quiver of 










knowledge, mount the chariot of devotion; Bend the bow of your tongue with the bow-string of 










love, and aim at him the shaft of Mother Kali's holy name. Here is a ruse for the fray: You need no 










chariot or charioteer; Fight your foe from the Ganges' bank, and he is easily slain. 



















MASTER CONSOLES A BEREAVED FATHER 



















Then he said: "What can you do? Be ready for Death. Death has entered the house. You 










must fight him with the weapon of God's holy name. God alone is the Doer. I say: '0 Lord, I do as 










Thou doest through me. I speak as Thou speakest through me. I am the machine and Thou art the 










Operator. I am the house and Thou art the Indweller. I am the engine and Thou art the Engineer.' 










Give your power of attorney to God. One doesn't come to grief through letting a good man assume 










one's responsibilities. Let His will be done. 



















"But isn't your grief for your son only natural? The son is one's own self reborn. Lakshmana 










ran to Ravana when the latter fell dead on the battlefield. Looking at Ravana's body, he found that 










everyone of his bones was full of holes. Thereupon he said to Rama: '0 Rama, glory be to Your 










arrows! There is no spot in Ravana's body that they have not pierced.' 'Brother,' replied Rama, 'the 










holes you see in his bones are not from My arrows. Grief for his sons has pierced them through 










and through. These holes are the marks of his grief. It has penetrated his very bones.' 



















"But house, wife, and children are all transitory; they have only a momentary existence. The 










palm-tree alone is real. One or two fruits have dropped off. Why lament? 



















"God is engaged in three kinds of activity: creation, preservation, and destruction. Death is 










inevitable. All will be destroyed at the time of dissolution. Nothing will remain. At that time the 










Divine Mother will gather up the seeds for the future creation, even as the elderly mistress of the 










house keeps in her hotchpotch-pot little bags of cucumber seeds, 'sea-foam', blue pills, and other 










miscellaneous things. The Divine Mother will take Her seeds out again at the time of the new 










creation." 



















Sri Ramakrishna began to talk with Adhar on the verandah north of his room. 



















MASTER (to Adhar): "You are a deputy magistrate. Remember that you have obtained your 










position through the grace of God. Do not forget Him, but remember that all men must one day 










walk down the same path. We stay in the world only a couple of days. 



















"This world is our field of activity. We are born here to perform certain duties. People have 










their homes in the country but come to Calcutta to work. 





































"It is necessary to do a certain amount of work. This is a kind of discipline. But one must 










finish it speedily. While melting gold, the goldsmith uses everything-the bellows, the fan, and the 










pipe-so that he may have the hot fire he needs to melt the metal. After the melting is over, he 










relaxes and asks his attendant to prepare a smoke for him. All this time his face has been hot and 










perspiring; but now he can smoke. 



















"One must have stern determination; then alone is spiritual practice possible. One must 










make a firm resolve. 



















"There is great power in the seed of God's name. It destroys ignorance. A seed is tender, 










and the sprout soft; still it pierces the hard ground. The ground breaks and makes way for the 










sprout. 



















"The mind becomes very much distracted if one lives long in the midst of 'woman and gold'. 










Therefore one must be very careful. But monks do not have much to fear. The real sannyasi lives 










away from 'woman and gold'. Therefore through the practice of spiritual discipline he can always 










fix his mind on God. 



















"True sannyasis, those who are able to devote their minds constantly to God, are like bees, 










which light only on flowers and sip their honey. Those who live in the world, in the midst of 










'woman and gold', may direct their attention to God; but sometimes their minds dwell also on 










'woman and gold'. They are like common flies, which light on a piece of candy, then on a sore or 










filth. 



















"Always keep your mind fixed on God. In the beginning you must struggle a little; later on 










you will enjoy your pension." 



















Sunday, April 15, 1883 



















Surendra, a beloved lay disciple of the Master, had invited him to his house on the 










auspicious occasion of the Annapurna Puja. It was about six o'clock when Sri Ramakrishna arrived 










there with some of his devotees. The image of the Divine Mother had been installed in the worship 










hall. At Her feet lay Hibiscus flowers and vilwa-leaves; from Her neck hung a garland of flowers. 










Sri Ramakrishna entered the hall and bowed down before the image. Then he went to the open 










courtyard, where he sat on a carpet, surrounded by his devotees and disciples. A few bolsters lay 










on the carpet, which was covered with a white linen sheet. He was asked to lean against one of 










these, but he pushed it aside. 



















DIFFICULTY OF OVERCOMING VANITY 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "To lean against a bolster! You see, it is very difficult to give up 










vanity. You may discriminate, saying that the ego is nothing at all; but still it comes, nobody knows 










from where. A goat's legs jerk for a few moments even after its head has been cut off. Or perhaps 










you are frightened in a dream; you shake off sleep and are wide awake, but still you feel your heart 










palpitating. Egotism is exactly like that. You may drive it away, but still it appears from somewhere. 










Then you look sullen and say: 'What! I have not been shown proper respect!" 1 



















KEDAR: "One should be lowlier than a straw and patient as a tree." 





































MASTER: "As for me, I consider myself as a speck of the dust of the devotee's feet." 



















Vaidyanath arrived. He was a well-educated man, a lawyer of the High Court of Calcutta. 










With folded hands he saluted the Master and took his seat at one side. 



















SURENDRA (to the Master): "He is one of my relatives." 



















MASTER: "Yes, I see he has a nice nature." 



















SURENDRA: "He has come here because he wants to ask you a question or two." 



















DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF DIVINE POWER 



















MASTER (to Vaidyanath): "All that you see is the manifestation of God's Power. No one can 










do anything without this Power. But you must remember that there is not an equal manifestation 










of God's Power in all things. Vidyasagar once asked me whether God endowed some with greater 










power than others. I said to him: 'If there are no greater and lesser manifestations of His Power, 










then why have we taken the trouble to visit you? Have you grown two horns?' So it stands to 










reason that God exists in all beings as the 



















All-pervasive Power; but the manifestations of His Power are different in different beings." 



















FREE WILL AND GOD S WILL 



















VAIDYANATH: "Sir, I have a doubt. People speak of free will. They say that a man can do 










either good or evil according to his will. Is it true? Are we really free to do whatever we like?" 



















MASTER: "Everything depends on the will of God. The world is His play. He has created all 










these different things-great and small, strong and weak, good and bad, virtuous and vicious. This is 










all His maya, His sport. You must have observed that all the trees in a garden are not of the same 










kind. 



















"As long as a man has not realized God, he thinks he is free. It is God Himself who keeps this 










error in man. Otherwise sin would have multiplied. Man would not have been afraid of sin, and 










there would have been no punishment for it. 



















"But do you know the attitude of one who has realized God? He feels: 'I am the machine, 










and Thou, Lord, art the Operator. I am the house and Thou art the Indweller. I am the chariot 










and Thou art the Driver. I move as Thou movest me; I speak as Thou makest me speak.' 



















(To Vaidyanath): "It is not good to argue. Isn't that so?" 



















VAIDYANATH: "Yes, sir. The desire to argue disappears when a man attains wisdom." 



















The Master, out of his stock of a dozen English words, said, "Thank you!" in the most 










charming way, and all laughed. 



















MASTER (to Vaidyanath): "You will make spiritual progress. People don't trust a man when 










he speaks about God. Even if a great soul affirms that he has seen God, still the average person will 










not accept his words. He says to himself, 'If this man has really seen God, then let him show Him to 





































me.' But can a man learn to feel a person's pulse in one day? He must go about with a physician for 










many days; only then can he distinguish the different pulses. He must be in the company of those 










with whom the examination of the pulse has become a regular profession. 



















"Can anyone and everyone pick out a yarn of a particular count? If you are in that trade, you 










can distinguish in a moment a forty-count thread from a forty-one." 



















The kirtan was about to begin. Some Vaishnavas were seated on one side with their 










mridangas and cymbals. A drummer began to play on his instrument preparatory to the singing. 










The sweet and melodious sound of the mridanga filled the courtyard, calling to mind the ecstatic 










kirtan of Sri Gauranga. The Master passed into a deep spiritual state. Now and then he looked at 










the drummer and said, "Ah! Ah! My hair is all standing on end." 



















The singers asked what kind of song they should sing. The Master said humbly, "Something 










about Gauranga, if you please." 



















The kirtan began. They sang about the celestial beauty of Sri Gauranga: 



















The beauty of Gauranga's face Glows brighter than the brightest gold; His smile illumines all 










the world. Who cares for even a million moons Shining in the blue autumn sky? 



















The chief musician added improvised lines as they sang: "0 friend, his face shines like the 










full moon!" "But it does not wane nor has it any stain." "It illumines the devotee's heart." Again he 










improvised: "His face is bathed with the essence of a million moons." 



















At these words the Master went into deep samadhi. After a short while he regained 










consciousness of the sense world. Then he suddenly stood up, overpowered by his spiritual mood, 










and sang improvised lines with the professionals, thinking himself to be a milkmaid of Vrindavan 










gone mad with the beauty of Sri Krishna's form: "Whose fault is it-my mind's or His beauty's?" "In 










the three worlds I see nothing but my beloved Krishna." 



















The Master danced and sang. All remained spellbound as they watched. The chief musician 










sang the words of a gopi: "0 flute, pray stop. Can you not go to sleep?" One of the musicians 










added a new line: "How can it sleep? It rests on Krishna's lips." 



















The Master sat down. The music went on. They sang, assuming the mood of Radha: "My 










eyes are blinded. My ears are deaf. I have lost the power of smell. All my senses are paralysed. But, 










alas, why am I left alone?" 



















Finally the musicians sang of the union of Radha and Krishna: 



















Radha and Krishna are joined at last in the Nidhu Grove of Vrindavan; Incomparable their 










beauty, and limitless their love! The one half shines like yellow gold, the other like bluest sapphire; 










Round the neck, on one side, a wild-flower garland hangs, and, on the other, there swings a 










necklace of precious gems. A ring of gold adorns one ear, a ring of shell the other; half of the brow 










is bright as the blazing midday sun, the other softly gleams with the glow of the rising moon. Upon 










one half of the head a graceful peacock feather stands, and, from the other half, there hangs a 










braid of hair. 





































As the music came to a close the Master said, "Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan", and bowed 










low to the devotees seated on all sides. He touched with his forehead the ground made holy by 










the singing of the sacred music. 



















It was now about half past nine in the evening. Surendra entertained the Master and the 










devotees with a sumptuous feast. When it was time to take leave of their host, the Master, the 










devotees, and Surendra entered the worship hall and stood before the image. 



















SURENDRA (to the Master): "No one has sung anything about the Divine Mother today." 



















MASTER (pointing to the image): "Ah! Look at the beauty of the hall. The light of the Divine 










Mother seems to have lighted the whole place. Such a sight fills the heart with joy. Grief and desire 










for pleasure disappear. 



















"But can one not see God as formless Reality? Of course one can but not if one has the 










slightest trace of worldliness. The rishis of olden times renounced everything and then 










contemplated Satchidananda, the Indivisible Brahman. 



















"The Brahmajnanis of modern times sing of God as 'immutable, homogeneous'. It sounds 










very dry to me. It seems as if the singers themselves don't enjoy the sweetness of God's Bliss. 










One doesn't want a refreshing drink made with sugar candy if one is satisfied with mere coarse 










treacle. 



















"Just see how happy you are, looking at this image of the Deity. But those who always cry 










after the formless Reality do not get anything. They realize nothing either inside or outside." 



















The Master sang a song to the Divine Mother: 



















Mother, ever blissful as Thou art, does not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss! My mind 










knows nothing but Thy Lotus Feet. The King of Death scowls at me terribly; tell me, Mother, what 










shall I say to him? 



















It was my heart's desire to sail my boat across the ocean of this mortal life, Durga, with 










Thy name upon my lips. I never dreamt that Thou wouldst drown me here in the dark waters of 










this shoreless sea. 



















Both day and night I swim among its waves, chanting Thy saving name; yet even so there is 










no end, Mother, to my grief. If I am drowned this time, in such a plight, No one will ever chant 










Thy name again. 



















Again he sang: 



















Repeat, mind, my Mother Durga's hallowed name! Whoever treads the path, repeating 










"Durga! Durga!", Siva Himself protects with His almighty trident. Thou art the day, Mother! Thou 










art the dusk and the night. Sometimes Thou art man, and sometimes woman art Thou. Thou 










mayest even say to me: "Step aside! Go away!" Yet I shall cling to Thee, Durga! Unto Thy feet As 










Thine anklets I shall cling, making their tinkling sound. Mother, when as the Kite Thou soarest in 










the sky, there, in the water beneath, as a minnow I shall be swimming; upon me Thou wilt pounce, 





































and pierce me through with Thy claws. Thus, when the breath of life forsakes me in Thy grip, do 










not deny me the shelter of Thy Lotus Feet! 



















The Master saluted the divine image. As he came down the steps, he called softly to Rakhal: 










"Where are my shoes? Are they missing?" 



















As the Master got into the carriage, Surendra and the other devotees bowed down before 










him. Then the carriage started for Dakshineswar. The moon still lighted the streets. 



















THE MASTER WITH THE BRAHMO DEVOTEES (II) 



















April 22, 1883 



















Master's visit to Brahmo festival 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA paid a visit to Benimadhav Pal's garden house at Sinthi, near Calcutta, on 










the occasion of the semi-annual festival of the Brahmo Samaj. Many devotees of the Samaj were 










present and sat around the Master. Now and then some of them asked him questions. 



















LOVE AND PRAYER 



















A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the way?" MASTER: "Attachment to God, or, in other 










words, love for Him. And secondly, prayer." 



















BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "Which one is the way-love or prayer?" 



















MASTER: "First love, and then prayer." 



















The Master sang: 



















Cry to your Mother Syama with a real cry, mind ! And how can She hold Herself from you? 










How can Syama stay away? . . . 



















Continuing, the Master said: "And one must always chant the name and glories of God and 










pray to Him. An old metal pot must be scrubbed every day. What is the use of cleaning it only 










once? Further, one must practise discrimination and renunciation; one must be conscious of the 










unreality of the world." 



















BRAHMO: "Is it good to renounce the world?" 



















MASTER: "Not for all. Those who have not yet come to the end of their enjoyments should 










not renounce the world. Can one get drunk on two annas' worth of wine?" 



















HOW TO LEAD A HOUSEHOLDER'S LIFE 



















BRAHMO: "Then should they lead a worldly life?" MASTER: "Yes, they should try to perform 










their duties in a detached way. Before you break the jack-fruit open, rub your hands with oil, so 










that the sticky milk will not smear them. The maidservant in a rich man's house performs all her 










duties, but her mind dwells on her home in the country. This is an example of doing duty in a 





































detached way. You should renounce the world only in mind. But a sannyasi should renounce the 










world both inwardly and outwardly." 



















BRAHMO: "What is the meaning of the 'end of enjoyments'?" 



















MASTER: "I mean the enjoyment of 'woman and gold'. It is risky to put a typhoid patient in a 










room where pitchers of water and jugs of pickled tamarind are kept. Most people don't feel any 










longing for God unless they have once passed through the experience of wealth, name, fame, 










creature comforts, and the like, that is to say, unless they have seen through these enjoyments." 



















BRAHMO: "Who is really bad, man or woman?" 



















MASTER: "As there are women endowed with vidyaSakti, so also there are women with 










avidyaSakti. A woman endowed with spiritual attributes leads a man to God, but a woman who is 










the embodiment of delusion makes him forget God and drowns him in the ocean of worldliness. 



















"This universe is created by the Mahamaya of God. Mahamaya contains both Vidyamaya, 










the illusion of knowledge, and Avidya-maya, the illusion of ignorance. Through the help of 










Vidya-maya one cultivates such virtues as the taste for holy company, knowledge, devotion, love, 










and renunciation. Avidya-maya consists of the five elements and the objects of the five senses- 










form, flavour, smell, touch, and sound. These make one forget God." 



















WHY THERE IS EVIL IN THE WORLD 



















BRAHMO: "If the power of avidya is the cause of ignorance, then why has God created it?" 



















MASTER: "That is His play. The glory of light cannot be appreciated without darkness. 










Happiness cannot be understood without misery. Knowledge of good is possible because of 










knowledge of evil. 



















"Further, the mango grows and ripens on account of the covering skin. You throwaway the 










skin when the mango is fully ripe and ready to be eaten. It is possible for a man to attain gradually 










to the Knowledge of Brahman because of the covering skin of maya. Maya in its aspects of vidya 










and avidya may be likened to the skin of the mango. Both are necessary." 



















BRAHMO: "Sir, is it good to worship God with form, an image of the Deity made of clay?" 



















MASTER: "You do not accept God with form. That is all right. The image is not meant for 










you. For you it is good to deepen your feeling toward your own Ideal. From the worshippers of the 










Personal God you should learn their yearning-for instance, Sri Krishna's attraction for Radha. You 










should learn from the worshippers of the Personal God their love for their Chosen Ideal. When the 










believers in the Personal God worship the images of Kali and Durga, with what feeling they cry 










from the depths of their souls, 'Mother! Mother!' How much they love the Deity! You should 










accept that feeling. You don't have to accept the image." 



















BRAHMO: "How does one cultivate the spirit of dispassion? Why don't all attain it?" 



















MASTER: "Dispassion is not possible unless there is satiety through enjoyment. You can 










easily cajole a small child with candies or toys. But after eating the candies and finishing its play, it 





































cries, 'I want to go to my mother.' Unless you take the child to its mother, it will throw away the 










toy and scream at the top of its voice." 



















The members of the Brahmo Samaj are opposed to the traditional guru system of orthodox 










Hinduism. Therefore the Brahmo devotee asked the Master about it. 



















THE NEED OF A GURU 



















BRAHMO: "Is spiritual knowledge impossible without a guru?" MASTER: "Satchidananda 










alone is the Guru. If a man in the form of a guru awakens spiritual consciousness in you, then know 










for certain that it is God the Absolute who has assumed that human form for your sake. The guru is 










like a companion who leads you by the hand. After the realization of God, one loses the distinction 










between the guru and the disciple. 'That creates a very difficult situation; there the guru and the 










disciple do not see each other.' It was for this reason that Janaka said to Sukadeva, 'Give me first 










my teacher's fee if you want me to initiate you into the Knowledge of Brahman.' For the distinction 










between the teacher and the disciple ceases to exist after the disciple attains to Brahman. The 










relationship between them remains as long as the disciple does not see God." 



















It was dusk. Some of the Brahmo devotees said to the Master, "Perhaps it is time for your 










evening devotions." 



















MASTER: "No, it isn't exactly that. One should pass through these disciplines in the 










beginning. Later one doesn't need the rituals of formal worship or to follow the injunctions." 



















After dusk the preacher of the Brahmo Samaj conducted the service from the pulpit. The 










service was interspersed with recitations from the Upanishads and the singing of Brahmo songs. 



















After the service the Master and the preacher conversed. 



















PERSONAL GOD AND FORMLESS DEITY 



















MASTER: "Well, it seems to me that both the formless Deity and God with form are real. 










What do you say?" PREACHER: "Sir, I compare the formless God to the electric current, which is 










not seen with the eyes but can be felt." 



















MASTER: "Yes, both are true. God with form is as real as God without form. Do you know 










what describing God as being formless only is like? It is like a man's playing only a monotone on his 










flute, though it has seven holes. But on the same instrument another man plays different 










melodies. Likewise, in how many ways the believers in a Personal God enjoy Him! They enjoy Him 










through many different attitudes: the serene attitude, the attitude of a servant, a friend, a mother, 










a husband, or a lover. 



















"You see, the thing is somehow or other to get into the Lake of the Nectar of Immortality. 










Suppose one person gets into It by propitiating the Deity with hymns and worship, and you are 










pushed into It. The result will be the same. Both of you will certainly become immortal. 



















"I give the Brahmos the illustration of water and ice. Satchidananda is like an endless 










expanse of water. The water of the great ocean in cold regions freezes into blocks of ice. Similarly, 





































through the cooling influence of divine love, Satchidananda assumes forms for the sake of the 










bhaktas. The rishis had the vision of the supersensuous Spirit-form and talked with It. But devotees 










acquire a 'love body', and with its help they see the Spirit-form of the Absolute. 



















"It is also said in the Vedas that Brahman is beyond mind and words. The heat of the sun of 










Knowledge melts the ice-like form of the Personal God. On attaining the Knowledge of Brahman 










and communing with It in nirvikalpa samadhi, one realizes Brahman, the Infinite, without form or 










shape and beyond mind and words. 



















GOD'S TRUE NATURE CANNOT BE DESCRIBED 



















"The nature of Brahman cannot be described. About It one remains silent. Who can explain 










the Infinite in words? However high a bird may soar, there are regions higher still. What do you 










say?" 



















PREACHER: "Yes, sir, it is so stated in the Vedanta philosophy." 



















MASTER: "Once a salt doll went to the ocean to measure its depth. But it could not come 










back to give a report. According to one school of thought, sages like Sukadeva saw and touched 










the Ocean of Brahman, but did not plunge into It. 



















"Once I said to Vidyasagar, 'Everything else but Brahman has been polluted, as it were, like 










food touched by the tongue.' In other words, no one has been able to describe what Brahman is. 










A thing once uttered by the tongue becomes polluted. Vidyasagar, great pundit though he was, 










was highly pleased with my remarks. 



















"It is said that there are places near Kedar that are covered with eternal snow; he who 










climbs too high cannot come back. Those who have tried to find out what there is in the higher 










regions, or what one feels there, have not come back to tell us about it. 



















"After having the vision of God man is overpowered with bliss. He becomes silent. Who 










will speak? Who will explain? 



















"The king lives beyond seven gates. At each gate sits a man endowed with great power and 










glory. At each gate the visitor asks, 'Is this the king?' The gate-keeper answers, 'No. Not this, not 










this.' The visitor passes through the seventh gate and. becomes overpowered with joy. He is 










speechless. This time he doesn't have to ask, 'Is this the king?' The mere sight of him removes all 










doubts." 



















PREACHER: "Yes, sir, it is so described in Vedanta." 



















MASTER: "When the Godhead is thought of as creating, preserving, and destroying, It is 










known as the Personal God, Saguna Brahman, or the Primal Energy, Adyasakti. Again, when It is 










thought of as beyond the three gunas, then It is called the Attributeless Reality, Nirguna Brahman, 










beyond speech and thought; this is the Supreme Brahman, Parabrahman. 





































THE THREE GUNAS 



















"Under the spell of God's maya man forgets his true nature. He forgets that he is heir to the 










infinite glories of his Father. This divine maya is made up of three gunas. And all three are robbers; 










for they rob man of all his treasures and make him forget his true nature. The three gunas are 










sattva, rajas, and tamas. Of these, sattva alone points the way to God. But even sattva cannot take 










a man to God. 



















PARABLE OF THE THREE ROBBERS 



















"Let me tell you a story. Once a rich man was passing through a forest, when three robbers 










surrounded him and robbed him of all his wealth. After snatching all his possessions from him, one 










of the robbers said: 'What's the good of keeping the man alive? Kill him.' Saying this, he was about 










to strike their victim with his sword, when the second robber interrupted and said: 'There's no use 










in killing him. Let us bind him fast and leave him here. Then he won't be able to tell the police.' 










Accordingly the robbers tied him with a rope, left him, and went away. 



















"After a while the third robber returned to the rich man and said: 'Ah! You're badly hurt, 










aren't you? Come, I'm going to release you.' The third robber set the man free and led him out of 










the forest. When .they came near the highway, the robber said, 'Follow this road and you will 










reach home easily.' 'But you must come with me too', said the man. 'You have done so much for 










me. We shall all be happy to see you at our home.' 'No,' said the robber, 'it is not possible for me 










to go there. The police will arrest me.' So saying, he left the rich man after pointing out his way. 



















"Now, the first robber, who said: 'What's the good of keeping the man alive? Kill him', is 










tamas. It destroys. The second robber is rajas, which binds a man to the world and entangles him 










in a variety of activities. Rajas makes him forget God. Sattva alone shows the way to God. It 










produces virtues like compassion, righteousness, and devotion. Again, sattva is like the last step of 










the stairs. Next to it is the roof. The Supreme Brahman is man's own abode. One cannot attain 










the Knowledge of Brahman unless one transcends the three gunas." 



















PREACHER: "You have given us a fine talk, sir." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Do you know the nature of devotees? When one devotee meets 










another, he says, 'Let me speak and you listen; and when you speak I shall listen.' You are a 










preacher and teach so many people! You are a steamship, and I am a mere fishing-boat.' (All 










laugh.) 



















Wednesday, May 2, 1883 



















About five o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna arrived at the temple of the Brahmo 










Samaj in Nandanbagan, accompanied by M., Rakhal, and a few other devotees. At first the Master 










sat in the drawing-room on the ground floor, where the Brahmo devotees gradually assembled. 










Rabindranath Tagore and a few other members of the Tagore family were present on this 










occasion. 





































Sri Ramakrishna was asked to go to the worship hall on the second floor. A dais had been 










built on the eastern side of the room. There were a few chairs and a piano in the hall. The Brahmo 










worship was to begin at dusk. 



















WHY TEMPLES ARE HOLY 



















As soon as the Master entered the worship hall he bowed low before the dais. Having taken 










his seat, he said to M. and the other devotees, "Narendra once asked me, 'What good is there in 










bowing before the Brahmo Samaj temple?' The sight of the temple recalls to my mind God alone; 










then God-Consciousness is kindled in my mind. God is present where people talk about Him. One 










feels there the presence of all the holy places. Places of worship recall God alone to my mind. 



















"Once a devotee was overwhelmed with ecstasy at the sight of a babla-tree. The idea 










flashed in his mind that the handle of the axe used in the garden of the temple of Radhakanta was 










made from the wood of the babla. Another devotee had such devotion for his guru that he 










would be overwhelmed with divine feeling at the sight of his guru's neighbours. 










Krishna-consciousness would be kindled in Radha's mind at the sight of a cloud, a blue dress, or a 










painting of Krishna. She would become restless and cry like a mad person, 'Krishna, where art 










Thou?' " 



















GHOSAL: "But madness is not desirable." 



















MASTER: "What do you mean? Was Radha's madness the madness that comes from 










brooding over worldly objects and makes one unconscious? One attains that madness by 










meditating on God. Haven't you heard of love-madness and knowledge-madness?" 



















A BRAHMO DEVOTEE: "How can one realize God?" 



















MASTER: "By directing your love to Him and constantly reasoning that God alone is real and 










the world illusory. The Aswattha tree alone is permanent; its fruit is transitory." 



















HOW TO SPIRITUALIZE THE PASSIONS 



















BRAHMO: "We have passions like anger and lust. What shall we do with these?" MASTER: 










"Direct the six passions to God. The impulse of lust should be turned into the desire to have 










intercourse with Atman. Feel angry at those who stand in your way to God. Feel greedy for Him. 










If you must have the feeling of I and Mine, then associate it with God. Say, for instance, 'My Rama, 










my Krishna.' If you must have pride, then feel like Bibhishana, who said, 'I have touched the feet of 










Rama with my head; I will not bow this head before anyone else.'" 



















RESPONSIBILITY FOR SINS 



















BRAHMO: "If it is God that makes me do everything, then I am not responsible for my sins." 










MASTER (with a smile): "Yes, Duryodhana also said that. '0 Krishna, I do what Thou, seated in my 










heart, makest me do.' If a man has the firm conviction that God alone is the Doer and he is His 










instrument, then he cannot do anything sinful. He who has learnt to dance correctly never 










makes a false step. One cannot even believe in the existence of God until one's heart becomes 










pure." 





































Sri Ramakrishna looked at the devotees assembled in the worship hall and said: "It is very 










good to gather in this way, now and then, and think of God and sing His name and glories. But the 










worldly man's yearning for God is momentary. It lasts as long as a drop of water on a red-hot 










frying-pan." 



















BRAHMO WORSHIP 



















The worship was about to begin, and the big hall was filled with Brahmo devotees. Some of 










the Brahmo ladies sat on chairs, with music books in their hands. The songs of the Brahmo Samaj 










were sung to the accompaniment of harmonium and piano. Sri Ramakrishna's joy was unbounded. 










The invocation was followed by a prayer, and then the worship began. The acharyas, seated on the 










platform, recited from the Vedas: 



















Om. Thou art our Father. Give us right knowledge; do not destroy us! We bow to Thee. 



















The Brahmo devotees chanted in chorus with the acharyas: Om. Brahman is Truth, 










Knowledge, Infinity. It shines as Bliss and Immortality. Brahman is Peace, Blessedness, and the One 










without a Second; It is pure and unstained by sin. 



















The acharyas chanted in praise of God: 



















Om. Reality, Cause of the Universe, we bow to Thee! 



















Then the acharyas chanted their prayer together: 



















From the unreal lead us to the Real; from darkness lead us to Light; from death lead us to 










Immortality. Reach us through and through, Rudra, and protect us evermore with Thy 










Compassionate Face. 



















As Sri Ramakrishna heard these hymns, he went into a spiritual mood. After this an Acharya 










read a paper. 



















The worship was over. Most of the devotees went downstairs or to the courtyard for fresh 










air while the refreshments were being made ready. It was about nine o'clock in the evening. The 










hosts were so engrossed with the other invited guests that they forgot to pay any attention to Sri 










Ramakrishna. 



















MASTER (to Rakhal and the other devotees): "What's the matter? Nobody is paying any 










attention to us!" 



















RAKHAL (angrily): "Sir, Let us leave here and go to Dakshineswar." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Keep quiet! The carriage hire is three rupees and two annas. Who 










will pay that? Stubbornness won't get us anywhere. You haven't a penny, and you are making 










these empty threats! Besides, where shall we find food at this late hour of the night?" 



















After a long time dinner was announced. The devotees were asked to take their seats. The 










Master, with Rakhal and the others, followed the crowd to the second floor. No room could be 










found for him inside the hall. Finally, with great difficulty, a place was found for him in a dusty 





































corner. A brahmin woman served some curry, but Sri Ramakrishna could not eat it. He ate luchi 










with salt and took some sweets. 



















There was no limit to the Master's kindness. The hosts were mere youngsters; how could he 










be displeased with them, even though they did not show him proper respect? Further, it would 










have been inauspicious for the household if a holy man had left the place without taking food. 










Finally the feast had been prepared in the name of God. 



















Sri Ramakrishna got into a carriage: but who was to pay the hire? The hosts could not be 










found. Referring to this incident afterwards, the Master said to the devotees, jokingly: "The boys 










went to our hosts for the carriage hire. First they were put out, but at last they managed to get 










together three rupees. Our hosts refused to pay the extra two annas and said, 'No, that will do.' " 



















Sunday, May 13, 1883 



















The Master paid a visit to the Hari-Bhakti-Pradayini-Sabha of Kansharipara, in Calcutta, on 










the anniversary day of that religious society. Kirtan and other forms of devotional music had been 










arranged for the occasion. The songs centred round the Vrindavan episode of Sri Krishna's life. The 










theme was Radha's pique because of Sri Krishna's having visited Chandravali, another of the gopis 










of Vrindavan. Radha's friends tried to console her and said to her: "Why are you piqued? It seems 










you are not thinking of Krishna's happiness, but only of your own." Radha said to them: "I am not 










angry at His going to Chandravali's grove. But why should He go there? She doesn't know how to 










take care of Him." 



















May 20,1883 



















The following Sunday a kirtan was arranged at the house of Ram, one of the Master's 










householder devotees. Sri Ramakrishna graced the occasion with his presence. The musicians sang 










about Radha's pangs at her separation from Krishna: 



















Radha said to her friends: "I have loved to see Krishna from my childhood. My fingernails 










are worn off from counting the days on them till I shall see Him. Once He gave me a garland. Look, 










it has withered, but I have not yet thrown it away. Alas! Where has the Moon of Krishna risen 










now? Has that Moon gone away from my firmament, afraid of the Rahu of my pique? Alas! Shall I 










ever see Krishna again? my beloved Krishna, I have never been able to look at You to my heart's 










complete satisfaction. I have only one pair of eyes; they blink and so hinder my vision. And further, 










on account of streams of tears I could not see enough of my Beloved. The peacock feather on the 










crown of His head shines like arrested lightning. The peacocks, seeing Krishna's dark-cloud 










complexion, would dance in joy, spreading their tails. friends, I shall not be able to keep my 










life-breath. After my death, place my body on a branch of the dark tamala tree and inscribe on my 










body Krishna's sweet name." 



















The Master said: "God and His name are identical; that is the reason Radha said that. There 










is no difference between Rama and His holy name." 





































May 27, 1883 





































Sri Ramakrishna was in his room at Dakshineswar, conversing with the devotees. It was 










about nine o'clock in the morning. 



















RELIGIOUS QUARRELS CONDEMNED 



















MASTER (to M. and the other devotees): "It is not good to harbour malice. The Saktas, the 










Vaishnavas, and the Vedantists quarrel among themselves. That is not wise. Padmalochan was 










court pundit of the Maharaja of Burdwan. Once at a meeting the pundits were discussing whether 










Siva was superior to Brahma, or Brahma to Siva. Padmalochan gave an appropriate reply. 'I don't 










know anything about it', said he. 'I haven't talked either to Siva or to Brahma.' 



















SINGLE-MINDED DEVOTION 



















"If people feel sincere longing, they will find that all paths lead to God. But one should have 










nishtha, single-minded devotion. It is also described as chaste and unswerving devotion to God. 










It is like a tree with only one trunk shooting straight up. Promiscuous devotion is like a tree with 










five branches. 



















Such was the single-minded devotion of the gopis to Krishna that they didn't care to look at 










anyone but the Krishna they had seen at Vrindavan-the Shepherd Krishna, bedecked with a 










garland of yellow wild-flowers and wearing a peacock feather on His crest. At the sight of Krishna 










at Mathura with a turban on His head and dressed in royal robes, the gopis pulled down their veils. 










They would not look at His face. 'Who is this man?' they said. 'Should we violate our chaste love 










for Krishna by talking to him?' 



















"The devotion of the wife to her husband is also an instance of unswerving love. She feeds 










her brothers-in-law as well, and looks after their comforts, but she has a special relationship with 










her husband. Likewise, one may have that single-minded devotion to one's own religion; but one 










should not on that account hate other faiths. On the contrary, one should have a friendly attitude, 










toward them." 



















The Master bathed in the Ganges and then went to the Kali temple with M. He sat before 










the image and offered flowers at the feet of the Divine Mother. Now and then he put flowers on 










his own head and meditated. 



















After a long time he stood up. He was in a spiritual mood and danced before the image, 










chanting the name of Kali. Now and again he said: "0 Mother! Destroyer of suffering! 










Remover of grief and agony!" Was he teaching people thus to pray to the Mother of the Universe 










with a yearning heart, in order to get rid of the suffering inevitable in physical life? 



















Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room and sat on the west porch. Rakhal, M., Nakur 










Vaishnav, and other devotees were with him. Nakur had been known to the Master for about 










twenty-five years. He was a devotee of Gauranga and had a small shop which Sri Ramakrishna had 










often visited when he first came to Calcutta from Kamarpukur. 



















Still overpowered with divine ecstasy, the Master sang: 





































Kali, my Mother full of Bliss! Enchantress of the almighty Siva! In Thy delirious joy Thou 










dancest, clapping Thy hands together! Eternal One! Thou great First Cause, clothed in the form of 










the Void Thou wearest the moon upon Thy brow, Where didst Thou find Thy garland of heads 










before the universe was made? Thou art the Mover of all that move, and we are but Thy helpless 










toys; We move alone as Thou movest us and speak as through us Thou speakest. But worthless 










Kamalakanta says, fondly berating Thee: Confoundress! With Thy flashing sword Thoughtlessly 










Thou hast put to death my virtue and my sin alike! 



















He sang again: 



















Mother, Thou art our sole Redeemer, Thou the Support of the three gunas, Higher than the 










most high. Thou art compassionate, I know, Who takest away our bitter grief. Sandhya art Thou, 










and Gayatri; Thou dost sustain this universe. Mother, the Help art Thou Of those that have no help 










but Thee, Eternal Beloved of Siva! 



















Thou art in earth, in water Thou; Thou liest at the root of all. In me, in every creature, 



















Thou hast Thy home; though clothed with form, yet art Thou formless Reality. 



















The Master sang a few more songs in praise of the Divine Mother. Then he said to the 










devotees: "It is not always best to tell householders about the sorrows of life. They want bliss. 










Those who suffer from chronic poverty can go without food for a day or two. But it is not wise to 










talk about the sorrows and miseries of life to those who suffer if their food is delayed a few 










minutes. Vaishnavcharan used to say: 'Why should one constantly dwell on sin? Be merry!' " 



















While the Master was resting after his midday meal, Manohor Goswami, a singer of kirtan, 










arrived. He sang about the ecstatic love of Gauranga and the divine episode of Vrindavan. The 










Master was absorbed in a deep spiritual mood. He tore off his shirt and said, to the melody of the 










kirtan, assuming the attitude of Radha: "0 Krishna, my Beloved! friends, bring Krishna to me. 










Then you will be real friends. Or take me to Him, and I will be your slave for ever." 



















The musician sat spellbound at Sri Ramakrishna's ecstasy; then he said with folded hands, 










"Won't you please rid me of my worldliness?" 



















MASTER: "You are like the holy man who went about the city after first finding a lodging. 










You are a sweet person and express many sweet ideas." 



















MUSICIAN: "Sir, I am like the bullock that only carries the bag of sugar but cannot taste it. 










Alas, I myself do not enjoy the sweetness of divine bliss." 



















The melodious music went on, and all were filled with joy. 



















Saturday, June 2, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna had been invited to visit the homes of his devotees Balaram, Adhar, and 










Ram in Calcutta. Devotional music had been arranged by Adhar and Ram. The Master was 










accompanied in the carriage by Rakhal, M., and others. 





































As they drove along, Sri Ramakrishna said to the devotees: "You see, sin flies away when 










love of God grows in a man's heart, even as the water of the reservoir dug in a meadow dries up 










under the heat of the sun. But one cannot love God if one feels attracted to worldly things, to 










'woman and gold'. Merely taking the vow of monastic life will not help a man if he is attached to 










the world. It is like swallowing your own spittle after spitting it out on the ground." 



















After a few minutes the Master continued: 'The members of the Brahmo Samaj do not 










accept God with form. Narendra says that God with form is a mere idol. He says further: 'What? He 










still goes to the Kali temple!'" 



















Sri Ramakrishna and his party arrived at Balaram's house. Yajnanath of Nandanbagan 










came to invite the Master to his house at four o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna agreed to 










go if he felt well. After Yajnanath's departure the Master went into an ecstatic mood. He said to 










the Divine Mother: "Mother, what is all this? Stop! What are these things Thou art showing to me? 










What is it that Thou dost reveal to me through Rakhal and others? The form is disappearing. But, 










Mother, what people call 'man' is only a pillow-case, nothing but a pillow-case. Consciousness is 










Thine alone. 



















"The modern Brahmajnanis have not tasted Thy sweet bliss. Their eyes look dry and so do 










their faces. They won't achieve anything without ecstatic love of God. 



















"Mother, once I asked Thee to give me a companion just like myself. Is that why Thou hast 










given me Rakhal?" 



















The Master went to Adhar's house, where arrangements were being made for the kirtan. 










Many devotees and neighbours had gathered in Adhar's drawing-room, anxious to listen to the 










Master's words. 



















SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION COMES FROM GOD 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Both worldliness and liberation depend on God's will. It is God 










alone who has kept man in the world in a state of ignorance; and man will be free when God, of 










His own sweet will, calls him to Himself. It is like the mother calling the child at meal-time, when 










he is out playing. When the time comes for setting a man free, God makes him seek the company 










of holy men. Further, it is God who makes him restless for spiritual life." 



















A NEIGIHBOUR: "What kind of restlessness, sir?" 



















MASTER: "Like the restlessness of a clerk who has lost his job. He makes the round of the 










offices daily and asks whether there is any vacancy. When that restlessness comes, man longs for 










God. A fop, seated comfortably with one leg over the other, chewing betel-leaf and twirling his 










moustaches-a carefree dandy-, cannot attain God." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Can one get this longing for God through frequenting the company of holy 



















men?" 





































MASTER: "Yes, it is possible. But not for a confirmed scoundrel. A sannyasi's kamandalu, 










made of bitter gourd, travels with him to the four great places of pilgrimage but still does not lose 










its bitterness." 



















The kirtan began. The musician sang of Sri Krishna's life in Vrindavan: 










RADHA: "Friend, I am about to die. Give me back my Krishna." 



















FRIEND: "But, Radha; the cloud of Krishna was ready to burst into rain. It was yourself who 










blew it away with the strong wind of your pique. You are certainly not happy to see Krishna happy; 










or why were you piqued?" 



















RADHA: "But this pride was not mine. My pride has gone away with Him who made me 










proud." 



















After the music Sri Ramakrishna conversed with the devotees. 



















MASTER: "The gopis worshipped Katyayani in order to be united with Sri Krishna. Everyone 










is under the authority of the Divine Mother, Mahamaya, the Primal Energy. Even the Incarnations 










of God accept the help of maya to fulfil their mission on earth. Therefore they worship the Primal 










Energy. Don't you see how bitterly Rama wept for Sita? 'Brahman weeps, ensnared in the meshes 










of maya.' 



















"Vishnu incarnated Himself as a sow in order to kill the demon Hiranyaksha. After killing the 










demon, the sow remained quite happy with her young ones. Forgetting her real nature, she was 










suckling them very contentedly. The gods in heaven could not persuade Vishnu to relinquish His 










sow's body and return to the celestial regions. He was absorbed in the happiness of His beast 










form. After consulting among themselves, the gods sent Siva to the sow. Siva asked the sow, 










'Why have you forgotten yourself?' Vishnu replied through the sow's body, 'Why, I am quite happy 










here.' Thereupon with a stroke of his trident Siva destroyed the sow's body, and Vishnu went back 










to heaven." 



















Ramchandra Dutta 



















From Adhar's house Sri Ramakrishna went to Ram's house. Ramchandra Dutta, one of the 










chief householder disciples of the Master, lived in Calcutta. He had been one of the first to 










announce the Master as an Incarnation of God. The Master had visited his house a number of 










times and unstintingly praised the devotion and generosity of this beloved disciple. A few of the 










Master's disciples made Ram's house virtually their own dwelling-place. 



















Ram had arranged a special festival to celebrate the Master's visit. The small courtyard was 










nicely decorated. A kathak, seated on a raised platform, was reciting from the Bhagavata when the 










Master arrived. Ram greeted him respectfully and seated him near the reader. The disciple was 










extremely happy. The kathak was in the midst of the story of King Harischandra. 





































STORY OF HARISHCHANDRA 



















The great King Harischandra of the Purana was the embodiment of generosity. No one ever 










went away from him empty-handed. Now, the sage Viswamitra, wanting to test the extent of the 










king's charity, extracted from him a promise to grant any boon that he might ask. Then the sage 










asked for the gift of the sea-girt world, of which Harischandra was king. Without the slightest 










hesitation the king gave away his kingdom. Then Viswamitra demanded the auxiliary fee, which 










alone makes charity valid and meritorious. The kathak continued his recitation: 



















Viswamitra said to the king: "0 King, you have given away the entire world, which was your 










kingdom. It now belongs to me; you cannot claim any place here. But you may live in Benares, 










which belongs to Siva. I shall lead you there with your wife Saibya, and Rohitasva, your son. There 










you can procure the auxiliary fee that you owe me." The royal family, accompanied by the sage, 










reached Benares and visited the temple of Siva. 



















At the very mention of Siva, the Master went into spiritual mood and repeated the holy 










name several times indistinctly. 



















The kathak continued: 



















The king could not procure the fee and was compelled to sell Saibya, his royal consort, to a 










brahmin. With her went Prince Rohitasva. But since even that was not enough to redeem his 










pledge to the sage, Harischandra sold himself to an untouchable who kept a cremation ground. 










He was ordered to supervise the cremations. One day, while plucking flowers for his brahmin 










master, Prince Rohitasva was bitten by a venomous snake and that very night died. The cruel 










brahmin would not leave his bed to help the poor mother cremate the body. The night was dark 










and stormy. Lightning rent the black clouds. Saibya started for the cremation ground alone, 










carrying the body of her son in her arms. Smitten with fear and overpowered with grief, the queen 










filled heaven and earth with her wailing. Arriving at the cremation ground, she did not recognize 










her husband, who demanded the usual fee for the cremation. Saibya was penniless and wept 










bitterly at her unending misfortunes. The impenetrable darkness was illumined only by the terrible 










flames of the cremation pyres. Above her the thunder roared, and before her the uncouth 










guardian of the cremation ground demanded his fee. She who had once been queen of the world 










sat there with her only child dead and cold on her lap. 



















The devotees burst into tears and loudly lamented this tragic episode of a royal life. And 










what was the Master doing? He was listening to the recital with rapt attention. Teardrops 










appeared in his eyes and he wiped them away. 



















The kathak continued: 



















When the queen, wailing bitterly, uttered the name of her husband, Harischandra at once 










recognized his wife and son. Then the two wept for the dead prince. Yet in all these misfortunes 










the king never once uttered a word of regret for his charity. Finally the sage Viswamitra appeared 










and told them that he had only wanted to put the king's charitable impulses to a crucial test. Then, 










through his spiritual power, the sage brought the prince back to life and returned to the king his 










lost kingdom. 





































STORY OF UDDHAVA 



















Sri Ramakrishna asked the kathak to recite the episode of Uddhava, the friend and devotee 










of Krishna. At the request of Krishna, Uddhava had gone to Vrindavan to console the cowherds and 










the gopis, who were sore at heart because of their separation from their beloved Krishna. 



















The Kathak said: 



















When Uddhava arrived at Vrindavan, the gopis and cowherd boys ran to him eagerly and 










asked him: "How is our Krishna? Has He forgotten us altogether? Doesn't He even speak our 










names?" So saying, some of them wept. Others accompanied him to various places in Vrindavan 










still filled with Krishna's sweet memory. They said: "Here it was that 



















Krishna lifted up Mount Govardhan, and here He killed the demons sent by the evil-minded 










Kamsa. In this meadow He tended His cows; here on the bank of the Jamuna He sported with the 










gopis. Here He played with the cowherd boys, and here in these groves He met the gopis secretly." 










Uddhava said to them: "Why are you so grief-stricken at Krishna's absence? He resides in all beings 










as their indwelling Spirit. He is God Himself, and nothing can exist without God." "But", said the 










gopis, "we do not understand all that. We can neither read nor write. We know only our Krishna of 










Vrindavan, who played with us here in so many ways." Uddhava said: "Krishna is God Himself. By 










meditating on Him, man escapes from birth and death in the world and attains liberation." The 










gopis said: "We do not understand big words like 'liberation'. We want to see the Krishna of our 










hearts." 



















The Master listened to the story from the Bhagavata with great attention and said at last, 










"Yes, the gopis were right." 



















Then he sang: 



















Though I am never loath to grant salvation, I hesitate indeed, to grant pure love. Whoever 










wins pure love surpasses all; He is adored by men; He triumphs over the three worlds. 



















Listen, Chandravali! I shall tell you of love: Mukti a man may gain, but rare is bhakti. Solely 










for pure love's sake did I become King Vali's door-keeper Down in his realm in the nether world. 



















Alone in Vrindavan can pure love be found; Its secret none but the gopas and gopis know. 










For pure love's sake I dwelt in Nanda's house; Taking him as My father, I carried his burdens on My 










head. 



















The Master said to the kathak: "The gopis had ecstatic love, unswerving and single-minded 










devotion to one ideal. Do you know the meaning of devotion that is not loyal to one ideal? It is 










devotion tinged with intellectual knowledge. It makes one feel: 'Krishna has become all these. He 










alone is the Supreme Brahman. He is Rama, Siva, and Sakti.' But this element of knowledge is not 










present in ecstatic love of God. Once Hanuman came to Dwaraka and wanted to see Sita and 










Rama. Krishna said to Rukmini, His queen, 'You had better assume the form of Sita; otherwise 










there will be no escape from the hands of Hanuman.' 





































"Once the Pandava brothers performed the Rajasuya sacrifice. All the kings placed 










Yudhisthira on the royal throne and bowed low before him in homage. But Bibhishana, the King of 










Ceylon, said, 'I bow down to Narayana and to none else.' At these words the 



















Lord Krishna bowed down to Yudhisthira. Only then did Bibhishana prostrate himself, crown 










and all, before him. 



















"Do you know what devotion to one ideal is like? It is like the attitude of a daughter-inlaw in 










the family. She serves all the members of the family-her brothers-in-law, fatherin-law, husband, 










and so forth-, bringing them water to wash their feet, fetching their towels, arranging their seats, 










and the like; but with her husband she has a special relationship. 



















CHARACTERISTICS OF DIVINE LOVE 



















"There are two elements in this ecstatic love: 'l-ness' and 'my-ness'. Yasoda used to think: 










'Who would look after Gopala if I did not? He will fall ill if I do not serve Him.' She did not look on 










Krishna as God. The other element is 'my-ness'. It means to look on God as one's own-'my Gopala'. 










Uddhava said to Yasoda: 'Mother, your Krishna is God Himself. He is the Lord of the Universe and 










not a common human being.' 'Oh!' exclaimed Yasoda. 'I am not asking you about your Lord of the 










Universe. I want to know how my Gopala fares. Not the Lord of the Universe, but my Gopala.' 



















"How faithful to Krishna the gopis were! After many entreaties to the door-keeper, the 










gopis entered the royal court in Mathura, where Krishna was seated as king. The doorkeeper took 










them to Him; but at the sight of King Krishna wearing the royal turban, the gopis bent down their 










heads and said among themselves: 'Who is this man with a turban on his head? Should we violate 










our chaste love for Krishna by talking to him? Where is our beloved Krishna with the yellow robe 










and the bewitching crest with the peacock feather?' 



















"Did you observe the single-minded love of the gopis for Krishna? The ideal of Vrindavan is 










unique. I am told that the people of Dwaraka worship Krishna, the companion of Arjuna, but reject 










Radha." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Which is the better, ecstatic love or love mixed with knowledge?" 



















PARABLE OF THE THREE FRIENDS 



















MASTER: "It is not possible to develop ecstatic love of God unless you love Him very deeply 










and regard Him as your very own. 



















"Listen to a story. Once three friends were going through a forest, when a tiger suddenly 










appeared before them. 'Brothers,' one of them exclaimed, 'we are lost!' 'Why should you say 










that?' said the second friend. 'Why should we be lost? Come, let us pray to God.' The third friend 










said: 'No. Why should we trouble God about it? Come, let us climb this tree.' 



















"The friend who said, 'We are lost!' did not know that there is a God who is our Protector. 










The friend who asked the others to pray to God was a jnani. He was aware that God is the Creator, 










Preserver, and Destroyer of the world. The third friend, who didn't want to trouble God with 










prayers and suggested climbing the tree, had ecstatic love of God. It is the very nature of such love 





































that it makes a man think himself stronger than his Beloved. He is always alert lest his Beloved 










should suffer. The one desire of his life is to keep his Beloved from even being pricked in the foot 










by a thorn." 



















Ram served the Master and the devotees with delicious sweets. 



















WITH THE DEVOTEES AT DAKSHINESWAR (I) 



















Monday, June 4, 1883 



















ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK in the morning the devotees began to arrive at the temple garden. 










Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the porch of his room facing the Ganges. M., who had spent the 










previous night with the Master, sat near him. Balaram and several other devotees were present. 










Rakhal lay on the floor, resting his head on the Master's lap. For the past few days the Master had 










been regarding Rakhal as the Baby Krishna. 



















Seeing Trailokya passing on his way to the Kali temple, Sri Ramakrishna asked Rakhal to get 










up. Trailokya bowed to the Master. 



















MASTER (to Trailokya): "Was there no yatra performance last night?" 



















TRAILOKYA: "No, sir. We couldn't conveniently arrange it." 



















MASTER: "What is done is done. But please see that this doesn't happen again. The 










traditions of the temple should be properly observed." 



















Trailokya gave a suitable reply and went on his way. After a while Ram Chatterji, the priest 










of the Vishnu temple, came up to Sri Ramakrishna. 



















MASTER: "Well, Ram, I told Trailokya that the yatra performance should not be omitted 










again. Was I right in saying that?". 



















RAM: "What of it, sir? Of course you were right. The traditions should be observed." 



















The Master asked Balaram to stay for his midday meal. Before the meal Sri Ramakrishna 










described to the devotees the days of his God-intoxication. Rakhal, M., Ramlal, and a few others 










were present. 



















MASTER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD YOUNG DISCIPLES 



















MASTER: "Now and then Hazra comes forward to teach me. He says to me, 'Why do you 










think so much about the youngsters?' One day, as I was going to Balaram's house in a carriage, I 










felt greatly troubled about it. I said to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, Hazra admonishes me for 










worrying about Narendra and the other young boys. He asks me why I forget God and think about 










these youngsters.' No sooner did this thought arise in my mind than the Divine Mother revealed to 










me in a flash that it is She Herself who has become man. But She manifests Herself most clearly 










through a. pure soul. At this vision I went into samadhi. Afterwards I felt angry with Hazra. I said to 










myself, 'That rascal made me miserable.' Then I thought: 'But why should I blame the poor man? 










How is he to know?' 





































HIS YEARNING FOR NARENDRA 



















"I know these youngsters to be Narayana Himself. At my first meeting with Narendra I 










found him completely indifferent to his body. When I touched his chest with my hand, he lost 










consciousness of the outer world. Regaining consciousness, Narendra said: 'Oh, what have you 










done to me? I have my father and mother at home!' The same thing happened at Jadu Mallick's 










house. As the days passed I longed more and more to see him. My heart yearned for him. One day 










at that time I said to Bholanath: 'Can you tell me why I should feel this way? There is a boy called 










Narendra, of the kayastha caste. Why should I feel so restless for him?' Bholanath said: 'You will 










find the explanation in the Mahabharata. On coming down to the plane of ordinary consciousness, 










a man established in samadhi enjoys himself in the company of sattvic people. He feels peace of 










mind at the sight of such men.' When I heard this my mind was set at ease. Now and then I would 










sit alone and weep for the sight of Narendra. 



















REMINISCENCES OF HIS GOD-INTOXICATED STATE 



















"Oh, what a state of mind I passed through! When I first had that experience, I could not 










perceive the coming and going of day or night. People said I was insane. What else could they say? 










They made me marry. I was then in a state of God-intoxication. At first I felt worried about my 










wife. Then I thought she too would eat and drink and live like me. 



















"I visited my father-in-law's house. They arranged a kirtan. It was a great religious festival, 










and there was much singing of God's holy name. Now and then I would wonder about my future. I 










would say to the Divine Mother, 'Mother, I shall take my spiritual experiences to be real if the 










landlords of the country show me respect.' They too came of their own accord and talked with me. 



















"Oh, what an ecstatic state it was! Even the slightest suggestion would awaken my spiritual 










consciousness. I worshipped the 'Beautiful' in a girl fourteen years old. I saw that she was the 










personification of the Divine Mother. At the end of the worship I bowed before her and offered a 










rupee at her feet. One day I witnessed a Ramlila performance. I saw the performers to be the 










actual Sita, Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and Bibhishana. Then I worshipped the actors and 










actresses who played those parts. 



















"At that time I used to invite maidens here and worship them. I found them to be 










embodiments of the Divine Mother Herself. 



















"One day I saw a woman in blue standing near the bakul-tree. She was a prostitute. But she 










instantly kindled in me the vision of Sita. I forgot the woman. I saw that it was Sita herself on her 










way to meet Rama after her rescue from Ravana in Ceylon. For a long time I remained in samadhi, 










unconscious of the outer world. 



















"Another day I had gone to the Maidan in Calcutta for fresh air. A great crowd had 










assembled there to watch a balloon ascension. Suddenly I saw an English boy leaning against a 










tree. As he stood there his body was bent in three places. The vision of Krishna came before me 










in a flash. I went into samadhi. 





































"Once, at Sihore, I fed the cowherd boys. I put sweetmeats into their hands. I saw that 










these boys were actually the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, and I partook of the sweetmeats from 










their hands. 



















"At that time I was almost unconscious of the outer world. Mathur Babu kept me at his 










Janbazar mansion a few days. While living there I regarded myself as the handmaid of the Divine 










Mother. The ladies of the house didn't feel at all bashful with me. They felt as free before me as 










women feel before a small boy or girl. I used to escort Mathur's daughter to her husband's 










chamber with the maidservant. 



















"Even now the slightest thing awakens God-Consciousness in me. Rakhal used to repeat the 










name of God half aloud. At such times I couldn't control myself. It would rouse my spiritual 










consciousness and overwhelm me." 



















Sri Ramakrishna went on describing the different experiences he had had while worshipping 










the Divine Mother as Her handmaid. He said: "Once I imitated a professional woman, singer for a 










man singer. He said my acting was quite correct and asked me where I had learnt it." The Master 










repeated his imitation for the devotees, and they burst into laughter. 



















After his noon meal the Master took a short rest. Manilal Mallick, an old member of the 










Brahmo Samaj, entered the room and sat down after saluting the Master, who was still lying on his 










bed. Manilal asked him questions now and then, and the Master, still half asleep, answered with a 










word or two. Manilal said that Shivanath admired Nityagopal's spiritual state. The Master asked in 










a sleepy tone what they thought of Hazra. 



















Then Sri Ramakrishna sat up on his bed and told Manilal about Bhavanath's devotion to 



















God. 



















MASTER: "Ah, what an exalted state he is in! He has hardly begun to sing about God before 










his eyes fill with tears. The very sight of Harish made him ecstatic. He said that Harish was very 










lucky. He made the remark because Harish was spending a few days here, now and then, away 










from his home." 



















Sri Ramakrishna asked M., "Well, what is the cause of bhakti? Why should the spiritual 










feeling of young boys like Bhavanath be awakened?" M. remained silent. 



















MASTER: "The fact is, all men may look alike from the outside, but some of them have 










fillings of 'condensed milk'. Cakes may have fillings of condensed milk or powdered black grams, 










but they all look alike from the outside. The desire to know God, ecstatic love of Him, and such 










other spiritual qualities are the 'condensed milk'." 



















REASSURANCE TO THE DEVOTEES & PARABLE OF THE TIGRESS 



















Sri Ramakrishna spoke reassuringly to the devotees. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Some think: 'Oh, I am a bound soul. I shall never acquire knowledge and 










devotion.' But if one receives the guru's grace, one has nothing to fear. Once a tigress attacked a 










flock of goats. As she sprang on her prey, she gave birth to a cub and died. The cub grew up in the 





































company of the goats. The goats ate grass and the cub followed their example. They bleated; the 










cub bleated too. Gradually it grew to be a big tiger. One day another tiger attacked the same flock. 










It was amazed to see the grass-eating tiger. Running after it, the wild tiger at last seized it, 










whereupon the grass-eating tiger began to bleat. The wild tiger dragged it to the water and said: 










'Look at your face in the water. It is just like mine. Here is a little meat. Eat it.' Saying this, it thrust 










some meat into its mouth. But the grass-eating tiger would not swallow it and began to bleat 










again. Gradually, however, it got the taste for blood and came to relish the meat. Then the wild 










tiger said: 'Now you see there is no difference between you and me. Come along and follow me 










into the forest.' 



















"So there can be no fear if the guru's grace descends on one. He will let you know who you 










are and what your real nature is. 



















"If the devotee practises spiritual discipline a little, the guru explains everything to him. 










Then the disciple understands for himself what is real and what is unreal. God alone is real, and 










the world is illusory. 



















PARABLE OF THE FALSE ASCETIC 



















"One night a fisherman went into a garden and cast his net into the lake in order to steal 










some fish. The owner heard him and surrounded him with his servants. They brought lighted 










torches and began to search for him. In the mean time the fisherman smeared his body with ashes 










and sat under a tree, pretending to be a holy man. The owner and his men searched a great deal 










but could not find the thief. All they saw was a holy man covered with ashes, meditating under a 










tree. The next day the news spread in the neighbourhood that a great sage was staying in the 










garden. People gathered there and saluted him with offerings of fruit, flowers, and sweets. Many 










also offered silver and copper coins. 'How strange!' thought the fisherman. 'I am not a genuine 










holy man, and still people show such devotion to me. I shall certainly realize God if I become a true 










sadhu. There is no doubt about it.' 



















"If a mere pretence of religious life can bring such spiritual awakening, you can imagine the 










effect of real sadhana. In that state you will surely realize what is real and what is unreal. God 










alone is real, and the world is illusory." 



















THE WORLD IS A DREAM 



















One of the devotees said to himself: "Is the world unreal, then? The fisherman, to be sure, 










renounced worldly life. What, then, will happen to those who live in the world? Must they too 










renounce it?" Sri Ramakrishna, who could see into a man's innermost thought, said very tenderly: 










"Suppose an office clerk has been sent to jail. He undoubtedly leads a prisoner's life there. But 










when he is released from jail, does he cut capers in the street? Not at all. He gets a job as a clerk 










again and goes on working as before. Even after attaining Knowledge through the guru's grace, 










one can very well live in the world as a Jivanmukta." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna reassure those who 










were living as householders. 





































257 





































MANUAL: "Sir, where shall I meditate on God when I perform my daily worship?" 



















MASTER: "Why, the heart is a splendid place. Meditate on God there." 



















Manilal, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, believed in a formless God. Addressing him, the 










Master said: "Kabir used to say: 'God with form is my Mother, the formless God my Father. Whom 










should I blame? Whom should I adore? The two sides of the scales are even.' During the day-time 










Haladhari used to meditate on God with form, and at night on the formless God. Whichever 










attitude you adopt, you will certainly realize God if you have firm faith. You may believe in God 










with form or in God without form, but your faith must be sincere and whole-hearted. Sambhu 










Mallick used to come on foot from Baghbazar to his garden house at Dakshineswar. One day a 










friend said to him: 'It is risky to walk such a long distance. Why don't you come in a carriage?' At 










that Sambhu's face turned red and he exclaimed: 'I set out repeating the name of God! What 










danger can befall me?' Through faith alone one attains everything. I used to say, 'I shall take all this 










to be true if I meet a certain person or if a certain officer of the temple garden talks to me.' What I 










would think of would invariably come to pass." 



















M. had studied English logic. In the chapters on fallacies he had read that only superstitious 










people believed in the coincidence of morning dreams with actual events. Therefore he asked the 










Master, "Was there never any exception?" 



















MASTER: "No. At that time everything happened that way. I would repeat the name of God 










and believe that a certain thing would happen, and it would invariably come to pass. (To Manilal) 










But you must remember, unless one is guileless and broad-minded, one cannot have such faith. 










Bony people, the hollow-eyed, the cross-eyed-people with physical traits like those cannot easily 










acquire faith. What can a man do if there are evil omens on all sides?" 



















It was dusk. The maidservant entered the room and burnt incense. Manilal and some other 










devotees left for Calcutta. M. and Rakhal were in the room. The Master was seated on his small 










couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine Mother. There was complete silence. 



















After a time Bhagavati, an old maidservant of the temple proprietor, entered the room and 










saluted the Master from a distance. Sri Ramakrishna bade her sit down. The Master had known her 










for many years. In her younger days she had lived a rather immoral life; but the Master's 










compassion was great. Soon he began to converse with her. 



















MASTER: "Now you are pretty old. Have you been feeding the Vaishnavas and holy men, 










and thus spending your money in a noble way?" 



















BHAGAVATI (smiling): "How can I say that?" 



















MASTER: "Have you been to Vrindavan, Benares, and the other holy places?" 



















BHAGAVATI (shrinkingly): "How can I say that- 1 have built a bathing place, and my name is 










inscribed there on a slab." 



















MASTER: "Indeed!" 



















BHAGAVATI: "Yes, sir. My name, 'Srimati Bhagavati Dasi', is written there." 





































MASTER (with a smile): "How nice!" 





































Emboldened by the Master's words, Bhagavati approached and saluted him, touching his 










feet. Like a man stung by a scorpion, Sri Ramakrishna stood up and cried out, "Govinda! Govinda!" 










A big jar of Ganges water stood in a comer of the room. He hurried there, panting, and washed 










with the holy water the spot the maidservant had touched. The devotees in the room were 










amazed to see this incident. Bhagavati sat as if struck dead. 



















Sri Ramakrishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone, "You should salute me from a 










distance." In order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment, the Master said tenderly, "Listen to a 










few songs." 



















The Master then sang about the Divine Mother: 



















The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight to the blue lotus flower of Mother 










Syama'sfeet. . . . 



















Then he sang: 



















High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite, When came a gust 










of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth. . . . 



















Again: 



















Dwell, mind, within yourself; enter no other's home. If you but seek there, you will find All 










you are searching for. 



















God, the true Philosopher's Stone, Who answers every prayer, 



















Lies hidden deep within your heart, the richest gem of all. 



















How many pearls and precious stones are scattered all about the outer court that lies 










before The chamber of your heart! 



















Tuesday, June 5, 1883 



















Rakhal and Hazra were staying with the Master in the temple garden at Dakshineswar. M., 










too, had been there since the previous Sunday. As it was a week-day there were only a few 










devotees in the room. Generally people gathered there in large numbers on Sundays or holidays. 



















It was afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was telling the devotees about his experiences during his 










God-intoxicated state. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Oh, what a state I passed through! At that time I didn't eat my meals 










here. I would enter the house of a brahmin in the village or at Baranagore or at Ariadaha. 










Generally it would be past meal-time. I would just sit down there without saying a word. If the 










members of the household asked me why I had come, I would simply say, 'I want something to 










eat.' Now and then I would go, uninvited of course, to Ram Chatterji's house at Alambazar or to 










the Choudhurys at Dakshineswar. But I didn't relish the food at the Choudhurys' house. 





































"One day I begged Mathur to take me to Devendra Tagore's house. I said: 'Devendra chants 










the name of God, I want to see him. Will you take me there?' Mathur Babu was a very proud man. 










How could one expect him to go to another man's house uninvited? At first he hesitated. But then 










he said: 'All right. Devendra and I were fellow students. I will take you to him.' 



















"Another day I learnt of a good man named Dina Mukherji, living at Baghbazar near the 










bridge. He was a devotee. I asked Mathur to take me there. Finding me insistent, he took me to 










Dina's house in a carriage. It was a small place. The arrival of a rich man in a big carriage 










embarrassed the inmates. We too were embarrassed. That day Dina's son was being invested with 










the sacred thread. The house was crowded, and there was hardly any place for Dina to receive us. 










We were about to enter a side room, when someone cried out: 'Please don't go into that room. 










There are ladies there.' It was really a distressing situation. Returning, Mathur Babu said, 'Father, I 










shall never listen to you again.' I laughed. 



















"Oh, what a state I passed through! Once Kumar Singh gave a feast to the sadhus and 










invited me too. I found a great many holy men assembled there. When I sat down for the meal, 










several sadhus asked me about myself. At once I felt like leaving them and sitting alone. I 










wondered why they should bother about all that. The sadhus took their seats. I began to eat 










before they had started. I heard several of them remark, 'Oh! What sort of man is this?' " 



















PARABLE OF THE FARMER 



















It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of his 










verandah. Hazra, Rakhal, and M. were near him. Hazra had the attitude of a Vedantist: "I am He." 



















MASTER (to Hazra): "Yes, all one's confusion comes to an end if one only realizes that it is 










God who manifests Himself as the atheist and the believer, the good and the bad, the real and the 










unreal; that it is He who is present in waking and in sleep; and that He is beyond all these. 



















"There was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced in age. 










As the child grew up, his parents became very fond of him. One day the farmer was out working in 










the fields, when a neighbour told him that his son was dangerously ill-indeed, at the point of 










death. Returning home he found the boy dead. His wife wept bitterly, but his own eyes remained 










dry. Sadly the wife said to her neighbours, 'Such a son has passed away, and he hasn't even one 










tear to shed!' After a long while the farmer said to his wife: 'Do you know why I am not crying? 










Last night I dreamt I had become a king, and the father of seven princes. These princes were 










beautiful as well as virtuous. They grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the 










various arts. Suddenly I woke up. Now I have been wondering whether I should weep for those 










seven children or this one boy.' To the jnanis the waking state is no more real than the dream 










state. 



















"God alone is the Doer. Everything happens by His will." 










LAW OF KARMA 



















HAZRA: "But it is very difficult to understand that. Take the case of the sadhu of Bhukailas. 










How people tortured him and; in a way, killed him! They had found him in samadhi. First they 





































buried him, then they put him under water, and then they branded him with a hot iron. Thus they 










brought him back to consciousness of the world. But in the end the sadhu died as a result of these 










tortures. He undoubtedly suffered at the hands of men, though, as you say, he died by the will of 










God." 



















MASTER: "Man must reap the fruit of his own karma. But as far as the death of that holy 










man is concerned, it was brought about by the will of God. The kavirajs prepare makaradhvaja in a 










bottle. The bottle is covered with clay and heated in the fire. The gold inside the bottle melts and 










combines with the other ingredients, and the medicine is made. Then the physicians break the 










bottle carefully and take out the medicine. When the medicine is made, what difference does it 










make whether the bottle is preserved or broken? So people think that the holy man was killed. But 










perhaps his inner stuff had been made. After the realization of God, what difference does it make 










whether the body lives or dies? 



















DIFFERENT KINDS OF SAMADHI 



















"The sadhu of Bhukailas was in samadhi. There are many kinds of samadhi. My own spiritual 










experiences tally with the words I heard from a sadhu of Hrishikesh. 



















Sometimes I feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me, as though it were the creeping 










of an ant. Sometimes it feels like the movement of a monkey jumping from one branch to another. 










Again, sometimes it feels like a fish swimming in water. Only he who experiences it knows what it 










is like. In samadhi one forgets the world. When the mind comes down a little, I say to the Divine 










Mother: 'Mother, please cure me of this. I want to talk to people.' 



















"None but the Isvarakotis can return to the plane of relative consciousness after attaining 










samadhi. Some ordinary men attain samadhi through spiritual discipline; but they do not come 










back. But when God Himself is born as a man, as an Incarnation, holding in His hand the key to 










others' liberation, then for the welfare of humanity the Incarnation returns from samadhi to 










consciousness of the world." 



















M. (to himself): "Does the Master hold in his hand the key to man's liberation?" 



















HAZRA: "The one thing needful is to please God. What does it matter whether an 










Incarnation of God exists or not?" 



















It was the day of the new moon. Gradually night descended and dense darkness enveloped 










the trees and the temples. A few lights shone here and there in the temple garden. The black sky 










was reflected in the waters of the Ganges. 



















The Master went to the verandah south of his room. A spiritual mood was the natural state 










of his mind. The dark night of the new moon, associated with the black complexion of Kali, the 










Divine Mother, intensified his spiritual exaltation. Now and then he repeated "Om" and the name 










of Kali. 



















He lay down on a mat and whispered to M. 





































MASTER: "Yes, God can be seen. X- has had a vision of God. But don't tell anyone about it. 










Tell me, which do you like better, God with form, or the formless Realitv?" 



















M: "Sir, nowadays I like to think of God without form. But I am also beginning to understand 










that it is God alone who manifests Himself through different forms." 



















MASTER: "Will you take me in a carriage some day to Mati Seal's garden house at Belgharia? 










When you throw puffed rice into the lake there, the fish come to the surface and eat it. Ah! I feel 










so happy to see them sport in the water. That will awaken your spiritual consciousness too. You 










will feel as if the fish of the human soul were playing in the Ocean of Satchidananda. In the same 










manner, I go into an ecstatic mood when I stand in a big meadow. I feel like a fish released from a 










bowl into a lake. 



















"Spiritual discipline is necessary in order to see God. I had to pass through very severe 










discipline. How many austerities I practised under the bel-tree! I would lie down under it, crying to 










the Divine Mother, '0 Mother, reveal Thyself to me.' The tears would flow in torrents and soak my 










body." 



















M: "You practised so many austerities, but people expect to realize God in a moment! Can a 










man build a wall simply by moving his finger around his home?" 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Amrita says that one man lights a fire and ten bask in its heat. I 










want to tell you something else. It is good to remain on the plane of the Lila after reaching the 










Nitya." 



















M: "You once said that one comes down to the plane of the Lila in order to enjoy the divine 



















play." 



















MASTER: "No, not exactly that. The Lila is real too. 



















"Let me tell you something. Whenever you come here, bring a trifle with you. Perhaps I 










shouldn't say it; it may look like egotism. I also told Adhar Sen that he should bring a pennyworth 










of something with him. I asked Bhavanath to bring a pennyworth of betel-leaf. Have you noticed 










Bhavanath's devotion? Narendra and he seem like man and woman. He is devoted to Narendra. 










Bring Narendra here with you in a carriage, and also bring some sweets with you. It will do you 










good. 



















PATHS OF LOVE AND KNOWLEDGE 



















"Knowledge and love-both are paths leading to God. Those who follow the path of love 










have to observe a little more outer purity. But the violation of this by a man following the path of 










knowledge cannot injure him. It is destroyed in the fire of knowledge. Even a banana tree is burnt 










up when it is thrown into a roaring fire. 



















"The jnanis follow the path of discrimination. Sometimes it happens that, discriminating 










between the Real and the unreal, a man loses his faith in the existence of God. But a devotee who 










sincerely yearns for God does not give up his meditation even though he is invaded by atheistic 





































ideas. A man whose father and grandfather have been farmers continues his farming even though 










he doesn't get any crop in a year of drought." 



















Lying on the mat and resting his head on a pillow, Sri Ramakrishna continued the 










conversation. He said to M: "My legs are aching. Please stroke them gently." Thus, out of his 










infinite compassion, the Master allowed his disciple to render him personal service. 



















June 8, 1883 



















It was a summer day. The evening service in the Kali temple was over. Sri Ramakrishna 










stood before the image of the Divine Mother and waved the fan a few minutes. 



















Ram, Kedar Chatterji, and Tarak arrived from Calcutta with flowers and sweets. Kedar was 










about fifty years old. At first he had frequented the Brahmo Samaj and joined other religious sects 










in his search for God, but later on he had accepted the Master as his spiritual guide. He was an 










accountant in a government office and lived in a suburb of Calcutta. 



















Tarak was a young man of twenty-four. His wife had died shortly after their marriage. He 










hailed from the village of Barasat not far from Calcutta. His father, a highly spiritual soul, had 










visited Sri Ramakrishna many times. Tarak often went to Ram's house and used to go to 










Dakshineswar in the company of Ram and Nityagopal. He worked in a business firm, but his 










attitude toward the world was one of utter indifference. 



















As Sri Ramakrishna came out of the temple, he saw Ram, Kedar, M., Tarak, and other 










devotees standing outside. He showed his affection for Tarak by touching his chin. He was very 










happy to see him. 



















Returning to his room, the Master sat on the floor in an ecstatic mood, with his legs 










stretched before him. Ram and Kedar decorated his feet with flowers and garlands. The Master 










was in samadhi. 



















MASTER'S EXHORTATION TO A DEVOTEE TO GO FORWARD 



















Kedar believed in certain queer practices of a religious sect to which he had once belonged. 










He held the Master's big toe in his hand, believing that in this way the Master's spiritual power 










would be transmitted to him. As Sri Ramakrishna regained partial consciousness, he said, "Mother, 










what can he do to me by holding my toe?" Kedar sat humbly with folded hands. Still in an ecstatic 










mood, the Master said to Kedar: "Your mind is still attracted by 'woman and gold'. What is the use 










of saying you don't care for it? Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandal-wood there are many 










more things: mines of silver, gold, diamonds, and other precious stones. Having a glimpse of 










spirituality, don't think you have attained everything." The Master was again in an ecstatic mood. 










He said to the Divine Mother, "Mother, take him away." At these words Kedar's throat dried up. In 










a frightened tone he said to Ram, "What is the Master saying?" 



















At the sight of Rakhal, Sri Ramakrishna was again overpowered with a spiritual mood. He 










said to his beloved disciple: "I have been here many days; when did you come?" 





































Was the Master hinting that he was an Incarnation of God, and Rakhal his divine 










companion, a member of the inner circle of devotees? 



















Sunday, June 10, 1883 



















The Master was sitting in his room with Rakhal, M., Latu, Kishori, Ramlal, Hazra, and other 










devotees. It was about ten o'clock in the morning. 



















REMINISCENCES OF BOYHOOD 



















Describing his early life, Sri Ramakrishna said to them: "During my younger days the men 










and women of Kamarpukur were equally fond of me. They loved to hear me sing. I could imitate 










other people's gestures and conversation and I used to entertain them that way. The women 










would put aside things for me to eat. No one distrusted me. Everybody took me in as one of the 










family. 



















"But I was like a happy pigeon. I used to frequent only happy families. I would run away 










from a place where I saw misery and suffering. 



















"One or two young boys of the village were my close friends. I was very intimate with some 










of them; but now they are totally immersed in worldliness. A few of them visit me here now and 










then and say, 'Goodness! He seems to be just the same as he was in the village school!' While I was 










at school, arithmetic would throw me into confusion, but I could paint very well and could also 










model small images of the deities. 



















"I loved to visit the free eating-places maintained for holy men and the poor, and would 










watch them for hours. 



















"I loved to hear the reading of sacred books such as the Ramayana and Bhagavata. If the 










readers had any affectations, I could easily imitate them and would entertain others with my 










mimicry. 



















"I understood the behaviour of women very well and imitated their words and intonations. 










I could easily recognize immoral women. Immoral widows part their hair in the middle and 










perform their toilet with great care. They have very little modesty. The way they sit is so different! 










But let's not talk of worldly things any more." 



















The Master asked Ramlal to sing. Ramlal sang: 



















Who is this terrible Woman, dark as the sky at midnight? Who is this Woman dancing over 










the field of battle like a blue lotus that floats on a crimson sea of blood? Who is She, clad alone in 










the Infinite for a garment, Rolling Her three great eyes in frenzy and savage fury? Under the weight 










of Her tread the earth itself is trembling! Siva, Her mighty Husband, who wields the fearful trident, 










Lies like a lifeless corpse beneath Her conquering feet. 



















The next song described the grief of Mandodari at the death of her husband Ravana. As he 










listened to it the Master shed tears of sorrow and said: "Once, when I entered the pine-grove over 





































there, I heard the boatmen on the Ganges singing that song and wept bitterly for a long time. I had 










to be brought back to my room." 



















Ramlal sang about the love of the gopis for Sri Krishna. Akrura was about to drive Sri Krishna 










in a chariot from Vrindavan to Mathura. The gopis would not let Him go. Some held the wheels of 










the chariot; some lay down in front of it. They blamed Akrura, not knowing that Sri Krishna was 










leaving them of His own will. Akrura was explaining this to the gopis. 



















Ramlal sang: 



















Hold not, hold not the chariot's wheels! Is it the wheels that make it move? The Mover of its 










wheels is Krishna, By whose will the worlds are moved. . . . 



















About the gopis, the Master said: "What deep love, what ecstatic devotion they had for 










Krishna! Radha painted the picture of Sri Krishna with her own hand, but did not paint His legs lest 










He should run away to Mathura! I used to sing these songs very often during my boyhood. I could 










reproduce the whole drama from memory." 



















After his meal Sri Ramakrishna sat on the couch. He had not yet found time to rest. The 










devotees began to assemble. One party arrived from Manirampur and another from Belgharia. 










Some of the devotees said, "We have disturbed your rest." 



















MASTER: "Oh, no! What you say applies only to a rajasic man. About him people say, 'Ah, 










now he will enjoy his sleep.'" 



















The devotees from Manirampur asked the Master how to realize God. 



















MASTER: "You must practise spiritual discipline a little. It will not do simply to say that milk 










contains butter. You must let the milk set into curd and then churn it. Only then can you get butter 










from it. Spiritual aspirants must go into solitude now and then. After acquiring love of God in 










solitude, they may live in the world. If one is wearing a pair of shoes, one can easily walk over 










thorns. 



















"The most important thing is faith. As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love; As is a 










man's feeling of love, so is his gain; And faith is the root of all. If one has faith one has nothing to 










fear." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, is it necessary to have a guru?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, many need a guru. But a man must have faith in the guru's words. He 










succeeds in spiritual life by looking on his guru as God Himself. Therefore the Vaishnavas speak of 










Guru, Krishna, and Vaishnava. 



















"One should constantly repeat the name of God. The name of God is highly effective in the 










Kaliyuga. The practice of yoga is not possible in this age, for the life of a man depends on food. 










Clap your hands while repeating God's name, and the birds of your sin will fly away. 



















"One should always seek the company of holy men. The nearer you approach the Ganges, 










the cooler the breeze will feel. Again, the nearer you go to a fire, the hotter the air will feel. 





































"But one cannot achieve anything through laziness and procrastination. People who desire 










worldly enjoyment say about spiritual progress: 'Well, it will all happen in time. We shall realize 










God some time or other.' 



















"I said to Keshab Sen: 'When a father sees that his son has become restless for his 










inheritance, he gives him his share of the property even three years before the legal time. A 










mother keeps on cooking while the baby is in bed sucking its toy. But when it throws the toy away 










and cries for her, she puts down the rice-pot and takes the baby in her arms and nurses it.' I said all 










this to Keshab. 



















"It is said that, in the Kaliyuga, if a man can weep for God one day and one night, he sees 



















Him. 



















"Feel piqued at God and say to Him: 'You have created me. Now You must reveal Yourself to 










me.' Whether you live in the world or elsewhere, always fix your mind on God. The mind soaked 










in worldliness may be compared to a wet match-stick. You won't get a spark, however much you 










may rub it. Ekalavya placed the clay image of Drona, his teacher, in front of him and thus learnt 










archery. 



















Go forward. The wood-cutter, following the instructions of the holy man, went forward and 










found in the forest sandal-wood and mines of silver and gold; and going still farther, he found 










diamonds and other precious stones. 



















"The ignorant are like people living in a house with clay walls. There is very little light inside, 










and they cannot see outside at all. But those who enter the world after attaining the Knowledge of 










God are like people living in a house made of glass. For them both inside and outside are light. 










They can see things outside as well as inside. 



















"Nothing exists except the One. That One is the Supreme Brahman. So long as He keeps the 










T in us, He reveals to us that it is He who, as the Primal Energy, creates, preserves, and destroys 










the universe. 



















"That which is Brahman is also the Primal Energy. Once a king asked a yogi to impart 










Knowledge to him in one word. The yogi said, 'All right; you will get Knowledge in one word.' After 










a while a magician came to the king. The king saw the magician moving two of his fingers rapidly 










and heard him exclaim, 'Behold, King! Behold.' The king looked at him amazed when, after a few 










minutes, he saw the two fingers becoming one. The magician moved that one finger rapidly and 










said, 'Behold, King! Behold.' The implication of the story is that Brahman and the Primal Energy 










at first appear to be two. But after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman one does not see the two. 










Then there is no differentiation; it is One, without a second -Advaita-non-duality." 



















The Master was very happy to see a musician who had come with the devotees from 










Belgharia. Some time before, Sri Ramakrishna had gone into an ecstatic mood on hearing his 










devotional music. At the Master's request the musician sang a few songs, one of which described 










the awakening of the Kundalini and the six centres: 





































Awake, Mother! Awake! How long Thou hast been asleep In the lotus of the Muladhara! 










Fulfil Thy secret function, Mother: Rise to the thousand-petalled lotus within the head, 



















Where mighty Siva has His dwelling; Swiftly pierce the six lotuses And take away my grief, 










Essence of Consciousness! 



















MASTER: "The song speaks of the Kundalini's passing through the six centres. God is both 










within and without. From within He creates the various states of mind. After passing through the 










six centres, the jiva goes beyond the realm of maya and becomes united with the Supreme Soul. 










This is the vision of God. 



















"One cannot see God unless maya steps aside from the door. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita 










were walking together. Rama was in front, Sita walked in the middle, and Lakshmana followed 










them. But Lakshmana could not see Rama because Sita was between them. In like manner, man 










cannot see God because maya is between them. (To Mani Mallick) But maya steps aside from the 










door when God shows His grace to the devotee. When the visitor stands before the door, the 










door-keeper says to the master, 'Sir, command us, and we shall let him pass.' 



















"There are two schools of thought: the Vedanta and the Purana. According to the Vedanta 










this world is a 'framework of illusion', that is to say, it is all illusory, like a dream. But according to 










the Purana, the books of devotion, God Himself has become the twenty-four cosmic principles. 










Worship God both within and without. 



















"As long as God keeps the awareness of T in us, so long do sense-objects exist; and we 










cannot very well speak of the world as a dream. There is fire in the hearth; therefore the rice and 










pulse and potatoes and the other vegetables jump about in the pot. They jump about as if to say: 










'We are here! We are jumping!' This body is the pot. The mind and intelligence are the water. The 










objects of the senses are the rice, potatoes, and other vegetables. The 'l-consciousness' identified 










with the senses says, 'I am jumping about.' And Satchidananda is the fire. 



















"Hence the Bhakti scriptures describe this very world as a 'mansion of mirth'. Ramprasad 










sang in one of his songs, 'This world is a framework of illusion.' Another devotee gave the reply, 










'This very world is a mansion of mirth.' As the saying goes, 'The devotee of Kali, free while living, is 










full of Eternal Bliss.' The bhakta sees that He who is God has also become maya. Again, He Himself 










has become the universe and all its living beings. The bhakta sees God, maya, the universe, and the 










living beings as one. Some devotees see everything as Rama: it is Rama alone who has become 










everything. Some see everything as Radha and Krishna. To them it is Krishna alone who has 










become the twenty-four cosmic principles. It is like seeing everything green through green glasses. 



















"But the Bhakti scriptures admit that the manifestations of Power are different in different 










beings. It is Rama who has become everything, no doubt; but He manifests Himself more in some 










than in others. There is one kind of manifestation of Rama in the Incarnation of God, and another 










in men. Even the Incarnations are conscious of the body. Embodiment is due to maya. Rama wept 










for Sita. But the Incarnation of God puts a bondage over His eyes by His own will, like children 










playing blindman's buff. The children stop playing when their mother calls them. It is quite 










different, however, with the ordinary man. The cloth his eyes are bandaged with is fastened to his 





































back with screws, as it were. There are eight fetters. Shame, hatred, fear, caste, lineage, good 










conduct, grief, and secretiveness-these are the eight fetters. And they cannot be unfastened 










without the help of a guru. 



















EARNESTNESS IN SPIRITUAL LIFE EXTOLLED 



















A DEVOTEE : "Sir, please bless us." MASTER: "God is in all beings. But you must apply to the 










Gas Company. It will connect the storage-tank with the pipe in your house. 



















"One must pray earnestly. It is said that one can realize God by directing to Him the 










combined intensity of three attractions, namely, the child's attraction for the mother, the 










husband's attraction for the chaste wife, and the attraction of worldly possessions for the worldly 










man. 



















TRAITS OF A TRUE DEVOTEE 



















"There are certain signs by which you can know a true devotee of God. His mind becomes 










quiet as he listens to his teacher's instruction, just as the poisonous snake is quieted by the music 










of the charmer. I don't mean the cobra. There is another sign. A real devotee develops the power 










of assimilating instruction. An image cannot be impressed on bare glass, but only on glass stained 










with a black solution, as in photography. The black solution is devotion to God. There is a third sign 










of a true devotee. The true devotee has controlled his senses. He has subdued his lust. The gopis 










were free from lust. 



















"You are talking about your leading a householder's life. Suppose you are a householder. It 










rather helps in the practice of spiritual discipline. It is like fighting from inside a fort. The Tantriks 










sometimes use a corpse in their religious rites. Now and then the dead body frightens them by 










opening its mouth. That is why they keep fried rice and grams near them, and from time to time 










they throw some of the grains into the corpse's mouth. Thus pacifying the corpse, they repeat the 










name of the Deity without any worry. Likewise, the householder should pacify his wife and the 










other members of his family. He should provide them with food and other necessities. Thus he 










removes the obstacles to his practice of spiritual discipline. 



















"Those who still have a few worldly experiences to enjoy should lead a householder's life 










and pray to God. That is why Nityananda allowed the worldly to enjoy catfish soup and the warm 










embrace of a young woman while repeating God's name. 



















"But it is quite different with genuine sannyasis. A bee lights on flowers and on nothing else. 










To the chatak all water except rain is tasteless. It will drink no other water, but looks up agape for 










the rain that falls when the star Svati is in the ascendant. It drinks only that water. A real sannyasi 










will not enjoy any kind of bliss except the Bliss of God. The bee lights only on flowers. The real 










monk is like a bee, whereas the householder devotee is like a common fly, which lights on a 










festering sore as well as on a sweetmeat. 



















"You have taken so much trouble to come here. You must be seeking God. But almost 










everyone is satisfied simply by seeing the garden. Only one or two look for its owner. People enjoy 










the beauty of the world; they do not seek its Owner. 





































(Pointing to the singer) "A little while ago he sang a song describing the six centres. These 










are dealt with in Yoga. There are two kinds of yoga: hathayoga and rajayoga. The hathayogi 










practises physical exercises. His goal is to acquire supernatural powers: longevity and the eight 










psychic powers. These are his aims. But the aim of rajayoga is the attainment of devotion, ecstatic 










love, knowledge, and renunciation. Of these two, rajayoga is the better. 



















SEVEN PLANES OF THE VEDAS 



















"There is much similarity between the seven 'planes' described in the Vedanta and the six 










'centres' of Yoga. The first three planes of the Vedas may be compared to the first three Yogic 










centres, namely, Muladhara, Svadhisthana, and Manipura. With ordinary people the mind dwells 










in these three planes, at the organs of evacuation and generation and at the navel. When the mind 










ascends to the fourth plane, the centre designated in Yoga as Anahata, it sees the individual soul 










as a flame. Besides, it sees light. At this the aspirant cries: 'Ah! What is this? Ah! What is this?' 



















"When the mind rises to the fifth plane, the aspirant wants to hear only about God. This is 










the Visuddha centre of Yoga. The sixth plane and the centre known by the yogi as Ajna are one and 










the same. When the mind rises there, the aspirant sees God. But still there is a barrier between 










God and the devotee. It is like the barrier of glass in a lantern, which keeps one from touching the 










light. King Janaka used to give instruction about Brahmajnana from the fifth plane. Sometimes he 










dwelt on the fifth plane, and sometimes on the sixth. 



















"After passing the six centres the aspirant arrives at the seventh plane. Reaching it, the 










mind merges in Brahman. The individual soul and the Supreme Soul become one. The aspirant 










goes into samadhi. His consciousness of the body disappears. He loses the knowledge of the outer 










world. He does not see the manifold any more. His reasoning comes to a stop. 



















"Trailanga Swami once said that because a man reasons he is conscious of multiplicity, of 










variety. Attaining samadhi, one gives up the body in twenty-one days. Spiritual consciousness is 










not possible without the awakening of the Kundalini. 



















"A man who has realized God shows certain characteristics. He becomes like a child or a 










madman, or an inert thing or a ghoul. Further, he is firmly convinced that he is the machine and 










God is its Operator, that God alone is the Doer and all others are His instruments. As some Sikh 










devotees once said to me, even the leaf moves because of God's will. One should be aware that 










everything happens by the will of Rama. The weaver said: 'The price of the cloth, by the will of 










Rama, is one rupee six annas. By the will of Rama the robbery was committed. By the will of Rama 










the robbers were 



















arrested. By the will of Rama I too was arrested by the police. And at last, by the will of 










Rama, I was released.' " 



















It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna had had no rest since his midday meal. He had talked 










unceasingly to the devotees about God. At last the visitors took their leave and went home. 





































Friday, June 15, 1883 





































It was a holiday on account of the Hindu religious festival Dasahara. Among the devotees 










who visited Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar that day were Adhar, M., and Rakhal 's father. 










RakhaTs father's father-in-law was also present. All were seated on the floor of the Master's room. 



















ADVICE TO HOUSEHOLDERS 



















Rakhal 's father's father-in-law was a devotee of God. He asked the Master, "Sir, can one 










realize God while leading the life of a householder?" 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Why not? Live in the world like a mudfish. The mudfish lives in the 










mud but itself remains unstained. Or live in the world like a loose woman. She attends to her 










household duties, but her mind is always on her sweetheart. Do your duties in the world, fixing 










your mind on God. But this is extremely difficult. I said to the members of the Brahmo Samaj: 










'Suppose a typhoid patient is kept in a room where there are jars of pickles and pitchers of water. 










How can you expect the patient to recover? The very thought of spiced pickles brings water to 










one's mouth.' To a man, woman is like that pickle. The craving for worldly things, which is chronic 










in man, is like the patient's craving for water. There is no end to this craving. The typhoid patient 










says, 'I shall drink a whole pitcher of water.' The situation is very difficult. There is so much 










confusion in the world. If you go this way, you are threatened with a shovel; if you go that way, 










you are threatened with a broomstick; again, in another direction, you are threatened with a 










shoe-beating. Besides, one cannot think of God unless one lives in solitude. The goldsmith melts 










gold to make ornaments. But how can he do his work well if he is disturbed again and again? 










Suppose you are separating rice from bits of husk. You must do it all by yourself. Every now and 










then you have to take the rice in your hand to see how clean it is. But how can you do your work 










well if you are called away again and again?" 



















A DEVOTEE: "What then is the way, sir?" 



















MASTER: "There is a way. One succeeds if one develops a strong spirit of renunciation. Give 










up at once, with determination, what you know to be unreal. Once, when I was seriously ill, I was 










taken to the physician Gangaprasad Sen. He said to me: 'I shall give you a medicine, but you 










mustn't drink any water. You may take pomegranate juice.' Everyone wondered how I could live 










without water; but I was determined not to drink it. I said to myself: 'I am a paramahamsa and not 










a goose. I shall drink only milk.' 



















"You have to spend a few days in solitude. If you but touch the 'granny' you are safe. Turn 










yourself into gold and then live wherever you please. After realizing God and divine love in solitude 










one may live in the world as well. (To Rakhal 's father) That is why I ask the youngsters to stay with 










me; for they will develop love of God by staying here a few days. After that they can very well lead 










the life of a householder." 



















PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL 



















DEVOTEE: "If God is responsible for everything, then why should people speak of good and 










evil, virtue and vice? One commits sin also by the will of God, isn't that so?" 



















ANOTHER DEVOTEE: "How can we understand the will of God?" 





































MASTER: "There is no doubt that virtue and vice exist in the world; but God Himself is 










unattached to them. There may be good and bad smells in the air, but the air is not attached to 










them. The very nature of God's creation is that good and evil, righteousness and unrighteousness, 










will always exist in the world. Among the trees in the garden one finds mango and jack-fruit, and 










hog plum too. Haven't you noticed that even wicked men are needed? Suppose there are rough 










tenants on an estate; then the landlord must send a ruffian to control them." 



















The conversation again turned to the life of the householder. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "You see, by leading a householder's life a man needlessly 










dissipates his mental powers. The loss he thus incurs can be made up if he takes to monastic life. 










The first birth is a gift of the father; then comes the second birth, when one is invested with the 










sacred thread. There is still another birth at the time of being initiated into monastic life. The two 










obstacles to spiritual life are 'woman' and 'gold'. Attachment to 'woman' diverts one from the way 










leading to God. Man doesn't know what it is that causes his downfall. Once, while going to the 










Fort, I couldn't see at all that I was driving down a sloping road; but when the carriage went inside 










the Fort, I realized how far down I had come. Alas! Women keep men deluded. Captain says, 'My 










wife is full of wisdom.' The man possessed by a ghost does not realize it. He says, 'Why, I am all 










right!' " 



















The devotees listened to these words in deep silence. 



















MASTER: "It is not lust alone that one should be afraid of in the life of the world. There is 










also anger. Anger arises when obstacles are placed in the way of desire." 



















M: "At meal-time, sometimes a cat stretches out its paw to take the fish from my plate. But 










I cannot show any resentment." 



















MASTER: "Why? You may even beat it once in a while. What's the harm? A worldly man 










should hiss, but he shouldn't pour out his venom. He mustn't actually injure others. But he should 










make a show of anger to protect himself from enemies. Otherwise they will injure him. But a 










sannyasi need not even hiss." 



















A DEVOTEE: "I find it is extremely difficult for a householder to realize God. How few people 










can lead the life you prescribe for them! I haven't found any." 



















MASTER: "Why should that be so? I have heard of a deputy magistrate named Pratap Singh. 










He is a great man. He has many virtues: compassion and devotion to God. He meditates on God. 










Once he sent for me. Certainly there are people like him. 



















"The practice of discipline is absolutely necessary. Why shouldn't a man succeed if he 










practises sadhana? But he doesn't have to work hard if he has real faith-faith in his guru's words. 










Once Vyasa was about to cross the Jamuna, when the gopis also arrived there, wishing to go to the 










other side. But no ferry-boat was in sight. They said to Vyasa, 'Revered sir, what shall we do now?' 










'Don't worry', said Vyasa. 'I will take you across. But I am very hungry. Have you anything for me to 










eat?' The gopis had plenty of milk, cream, and butter with them. Vyasa ate it all. Then the gopis 










asked, 'Well, sir, what about crossing the river?' Vyasa stood on the bank of the Jamuna and said, 





































'0 Jamuna, if I have not eaten anything today, then may your waters part so that we may all walk 










to the other side.' No sooner did the sage utter these words than the waters of the Jamuna parted. 










The gopis were speechless with wonder. 'He ate so much just now,' they said to themselves, 'and 










he says, "If I have not eaten anything. . ."!' Vyasa had the firm conviction that it was not himself, 










but the Narayana who dwelt in his heart, that had partaken of the food. 



















"Sankaracharya was a Brahmajnani, to be sure. But at the beginning he too had the feeling 










of differentiation. He didn't have absolute faith that everything in the world is Brahman. One day 










as he was coming out of the Ganges after his bath, he saw an untouchable, a butcher, carrying a 










load of meat. Inadvertently the butcher touched his body. Sankara shouted angrily, 'Hey there! 










How dare you touch me?' 'Revered sir,' said the butcher, 'I have not touched you, nor have you 










touched me. The Pure Self cannot be the body nor the five elements nor the twenty-four cosmic 










principles.' Then Sankara came to his senses. Once Jadabharata was carrying King Rahugana's 










palanquin and at the same time giving a discourse on Self-Knowledge. The king got down from the 










palanquin and said to Jadabharata, 'Who are you, pray?' The latter answered, 'I am Not this, not 










this-l am the Pure Self.' He had perfect faith that he was the Pure Self. 



















'"I am He', 'I am the Pure Self -that is the conclusion of the jnanis. But the bhaktas say, 'The 










whole universe is the glory of God.' Who would recognize a wealthy man without his power and 










riches? But it is quite different when God Himself, gratified by the aspirant's devotion, says to him, 










'You are the same as Myself.' Suppose a king is seated in his court, and his cook enters the hall, sits 










on the throne, and says, '0 King, you and I are the same!' People will certainly call him a madman. 










But suppose one day the king, pleased with the cook's service, says to him: 'Come, sit beside me. 










There is nothing wrong in that. There is no difference between you and me.' Then, if the cook sits 










on the throne with the king, there is no harm in it. It is not good for ordinary people to say, 'I am 










He'. The waves belong to the water. Does the water belong to the waves? 



















RESULT OF YOGA THROUGH BHAKTI 



















"The upshot of the whole thing is that, no matter what path you follow, yoga is impossible 










unless the mind becomes quiet. The mind of a yogi is under his control; he is not under the control 










of his mind. When the mind is quiet the prana stops functioning. Then one gets kumbhaka. One 










may have the same kumbhaka through bhaktiyoga as well; the prana stops functioning through 










love of God too. In the kirtan the musician sings, 'Nitai amar mata hati !' Repeating this, he goes 










into a spiritual mood and cannot sing the whole sentence. He simply sings, 'Hati! Hati' When the 










mood deepens he sings only, 'Ha! Ha!' Thus his prana stops through ecstasy, and kumbhaka 










follows. 



















"Suppose a man is sweeping a courtyard with his broom, and another man comes and says 










to him: 'Hello! So-and-so is no more. He is dead.' Now, if the dead person was not related to the 










sweeper, the latter goes on with his work, remarking casually: 'Ah! That's too bad. He is dead. He 










was a good fellow.' The sweeping goes on all the same. But if the dead man was his relative, then 










the broom drops from his hand. 'Ah!' he exclaims, and he too drops to the ground. His prana has 










stopped functioning. He can neither work nor think. Haven't you noticed, among women, that if 










one of them looks at something or listens to something in speechless amazement, the other 





































women say to her, 'What? Are you in ecstasy?' In this instance, too, the prana has stopped 










functioning, and so she remains speechless, with mouth agape. 



















"It will not do merely to repeat, 'I am He, I am He.' There are certain signs of a Jnani. 










Narendra has big protruding eyes. (Pointing to a devotee) He also has good eyes and forehead. 



















DIFFERENT CLASSES OF MEN 



















"All men are by no means on the same level. It is said that there are four classes of men: the 










bound, the struggling, the liberated, and the ever-free. It is also not a fact that all men have to 










practise spiritual discipline. There are the ever-free and those who achieve perfection through 










spiritual discipline. Some realize God after much spiritual austerity, and some are perfect from 










their very birth. Prahlada is an example of the ever-free. 



















"Eternally perfect sages like Prahlada also practise meditation and prayer. But they have 










realized the fruit, God-vision, even before their spiritual practice. They are like gourds and 










pumpkins, which grow fruit first and then flowers. 



















(Looking at Rakhal 's father) "Even though an eternally perfect soul is born in a low family, 










still he retains his innate perfection. He cannot do anything else. A pea germinating in a heap of 










cow-dung still grows into a pea-plant. 



















"God has given to some greater power than to others. In one man you see it as the light of a 










lamp, in another, as the light of a torch. One word of Vidyasagar's revealed to me the utmost limit 










of his intelligence. When I told him of the different manifestations of 



















God's Power in different beings, he said to me, 'Sir, has God then given greater power to 










some than to others?' At once I said: 'Yes, certainly He has; if there are not different degrees of 










manifestation of His Power, then why should your name be known far and wide? You see, we have 










come to you after hearing of your knowledge and compassion. You haven't grown two horns, have 










you?' With all his fame and erudition, Vidyasagar said such a childish thing as 'Has God given 










greater power to some than to others?' The truth is that when the fisherman draws his net, he first 










catches big fish like trout and carp; then he stirs up the mud with his feet, and small fish come 










out-minnows, mud-fish, and so on. So also, unless a man knows God, 'minnows' and the like 










gradually come out from within him. What can one achieve through mere scholarship?" 



















Sunday, June 17, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna was resting in his room in the temple garden at Dakshineswar. It was 










afternoon. Adhar and M. arrived and saluted the Master. A Tantrik devotee also came in. Rakhal , 










Hazra, and Ramlal were staying with Sri Ramakrishna. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Why shouldn't one be able to attain spirituality, living the life of 










a householder? But it is extremely difficult. Sages like Janaka entered the world after attaining 










Knowledge. But still the world is a place of terror. Even a detached householder has to be careful. 










Once Janaka bent down his head at the sight of a bhairavi. He shrank from seeing a woman. The 










bhairavi said to him: 'Janaka, I see you have not yet attained Knowledge. You still differentiate 










between man and woman.' 





































"If you move about in a room filled with soot, you will soil your body, however slightly, no 










matter how clever you may be. I have seen householder devotees filled with spiritual emotion 










while performing their daily worship wearing their silk clothes. They maintain that attitude even 










until they take their refreshments after the worship. But afterwards they become their old selves 










again. They display their rajasic and tamasic natures. 



















"Sattva begets bhakti. Even bhakti has three aspects: sattva, rajas, and tamas. The sattva of 










bhakti is pure sattva. When a devotee acquires it he doesn't direct his mind to anything but God. 










He pays only as much attention to his body as is absolutely necessary for its protection. 



















"But a paramahamsa is beyond the three gunas. Though they exist in him, yet they are 










practically non-existent. Like a child, he is not under the control of any of the gunas. That is why 










paramahamsas allow small children to come near them- in order to assume their nature. 



















"Paramahamsas may not lay things up; but this rule does not apply to householders. They 










must provide for their families." 



















TANTRIK DEVOTEE: "Is a paramahamsa aware of virtue and vice?" 



















MASTER: "Keshab Sen also asked that question. I said to him, 'If I explain that to you, then 










you won't be able to keep your society together.' 'In that case we had better stop here', said 










Keshab. 



















"Do you know the significance of virtue and vice? A paramahamsa sees that it is God who 










gives us evil tendencies as well as good tendencies. Haven't you noticed that there are both sweet 










and bitter fruits? Some trees give sweet fruit, and some bitter or sour. God has made the 










mango-tree, which yields sweet fruit, and also the hog plum, which yields sour fruit." 



















TANTRIK: "Yes, sir. That is true. On the hill-top one sees extensive rose gardens, reaching as 










far as the eye can see." 



















MASTER: "The paramahamsa realizes that all these-good and bad, virtue and vice, real and 










unreal-are only the glories of God's maya. But these are very deep thoughts. One realizing this 










cannot keep an organization together or anything like that." 



















TANTRIK: "But the law of karma exists, doesn't it?" 



















MASTER: "That also is true. Good produces good, and bad produces bad. Don't you get the 










hot taste if you eat chillies? But these are all God's lila, His play." 



















TANTRIK: "Then what is the way for us? We shall have to reap the result of our past karma, 










shall we not?" 



















MASTER: "That may be so. But it is different with the devotees of God. Listen to a song: 



















mind, you do not know how to farm! Fallow lies the field of your life. If you had only 










worked it well, how rich a harvest you might reap! Hedge it about with Kali's name if you would 










keep your harvest safe; this is the stoutest hedge of all, For Death himself cannot come near it. 





































Sooner or later will dawn the day when you must forfeit your precious field; Gather, 










mind, what fruit you may. Sow for your seed the holy name Of God that your guru has given to 










you, faithfully watering it with love; and if you should find the task too hard, call upon Ramprasad 










for help. 



















He sang again: 



















I have securely blocked the way by which the King of Death will come; Henceforward all my 










doubts and fears are set at naught for ever. Siva Himself is standing guard at the nine doorways of 










my house, which has one Pillar for support, and three ropes to secure it. The Lord has made His 










dwelling-place the thousand-petalled lotus flower within the head, and comforts me with 










never-ceasing care. 



















The Master continued: "Anyone who dies in Benares, whether a brahmin or a prostitute, 










will become Siva. When a man sheds tears at the name of Hari, Kali, or Rama, then he has no 










further need of the sandhya and other rites. All actions drop away of themselves. The fruit of 










action does not touch him." 



















Again the Master sang: 



















As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love; as is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain; 










And faith is the root of all. If in the Nectar Lake of Mother Kali's feet my mind remains immersed, 










Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice. 



















He sang another song: 



















Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas, So long as I can breathe my 










last with Kali's name upon my lips?.. 



















Then he said, "When a man merges himself in God, he can no longer retain wicked or sinful 










tendencies." 



















TANTRIK: "You have said rightly that he keeps only the 'Knowledge ego'." 



















MASTER: "Yes, he keeps only the 'Knowledge ego', the 'devotee ego', the 'servant ego', and 










the 'good ego'. His 'wicked ego' disappears." 



















TANTRIK: "Today you have destroyed many of our doubts." 



















MASTER: "All doubts disappear when one realizes the Self. 



















"Assume the tamasic aspect of bhakti. Say with force: 'What? I have uttered the names of 










Rama and Kali. How can I be in bondage any more? How can I be affected by the law of karma?' " 



















The Master sang: 



















If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name, How canst Thou then, Blessed One, 










Withhold from me deliverance, 





































Wretched though I may be? I may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn, Or 










slain a woman or a cow, Or even caused a brahmin's death; But, though it all be true, Nothing of 










this can make me feel the least uneasiness; For through the power of Thy sweet name My 










wretched soul may still aspire Even to Brahmanhood. 



















The Master continued: "Faith! Faith! Faith! Once a guru said to his pupil, 'Rama alone has 










become everything.' When a dog began to eat the pupil's bread, he said to it: '0 Rama, wait a little. 










I shall butter Your bread.' Such was his faith in the words of his guru. 



















"Worthless people do not have any faith. They always doubt. But doubts do not disappear 










completely till one realizes the Self. 



















"In genuine love of God there is no desire. Only through such love does one speedily realize 










God. Attainment of supernatural powers and so on- these are desires. Krishna once said to Arjuna: 










'Friend, you cannot realize God if you acquire even one of the eight supernatural powers. They 










will only add a little to your power.' " 



















TANTRIK: "Sir, why don't the rituals of Tantra bear fruit nowadays?" 



















MASTER: "It is because people cannot practise them with absolute correctness and 










devotion." 



















In conclusion the Master said: "Love of God is the one essential thing. A true lover of God 










has nothing to fear, nothing to worry about. He is aware that the Divine Mother knows everything. 










The cat handles the mouse one way, but its own kitten a very different way." 



















THE FESTIVAL AT PANIHATI 



















Monday, June 18, 1883 



















Festival at Panihati 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA had been invited to the great religious festival at Panihati, near Calcutta. 










This "Festival of the Flattened Rice" was inaugurated by Raghunath Das, a disciple of Sri Chaitanya. 










It is said that Raghunath used to run away from home, secretly practise his devotions, and enjoy 










the bliss of spiritual ecstasy. One day Nityananda said to him: "Thief! You run away from home and 










enjoy the love of God all alone. You hide it from us. I shall punish you today. You must arrange a 










religious festival and entertain the devotees with flattened rice." Since then the festival has been 










annually celebrated at Panihati by the Vaishnavas. Thousands of the followers of Sri Chaitanya 










participate in it. Its chief feature is the singing of the names and glories of God, and the dancing of 










the devotees in religious fervour. The centre of the festivity is the temple of Radha-Krishna, built 










on the bank of the Ganges. 



















The Master had been invited to the festival by Mani Sen, who was the custodian of the 










temple. Ram, M., Rakhal , Bhavanath, and a few other disciples went with the Master in a carriage. 










On his way to Panihati Sri Ramakrishna was in a light mood and joked with the youngsters. But 










as soon as the carriage reached the place of the festival, the Master, to the utter amazement of 










the devotees, shot into the crowd. He joined the kirtan party of Navadvip Goswami, Mani Sen's 





































guru, and danced, totally forgetting the world. Every now and then he stood still in samadhi, 










carefully supported by Navadvip Goswami for fear he might fall to the ground. Thousands of 










devotees were gathered together for the festival. Wherever one looked there was a forest of 










human heads. The crowd seemed to become infected by the Master's divine fervour and swayed 










to and fro, chanting the name of God, until the very air seemed to reverberate with it. rums, 










cymbals, and other instruments produced melodious sounds. The atmosphere became intense 










with spiritual fervour. The devotees felt that Gauranga himself was being manifested in the person 










of Sri Ramakrishna. Flowers were showered from all sides on his feet and head. The shouting of 










the name of Hari was heard even at a distance, like the rumbling of the ocean. 



















Sri Ramakrishna entered by turn into all the moods of ecstasy. In deep samadhi he stood 










still, his face radiating a divine glow. In the state of partial consciousness he danced, sometimes 










gently and sometimes with the vigour of a lion. Again, regaining consciousness of the world, he 










sang, himself leading the chorus: 



















Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep while chanting Hari's name, the brothers 










who dance in ecstasy and make the world dance in His name! Behold them, weeping themselves, 










and making the whole world weep as well, the brothers who, in return for blows, offer to sinners 










Hari's love. Behold them, drunk with Hari's love, who make the world drunk as well! Behold, the 










two brothers have come, who once were Kanai and Balai of Braja, They who would steal the butter 










out of the pots of the gopi maids. Behold, the two have come, who shatter all the rules of caste, 










embracing everyone as brother, even the outcaste shunned by men; who lose themselves in Hari's 










name, making the whole world mad; who are none other than Hari Himself, and chant His 










hallowed name! Behold them,who saved from their sinful ways the ruffians Jagai and Madhai, 










They who cannot distinguish between a friend and an enemy! Behold the two brothers, Gaur and 










Nitai, who come again to save mankind. 



















Again the Master sang: 



















See how all Nadia is shaking Under the waves of Gauranga's love! . . . 



















The crowd, with the Master in the centre, surged toward the temple of Radha-Krishna. Only 










a small number could enter. The rest stood outside the portal and jostled with one another to 










have a look at Sri Ramakrishna. In a mood of intoxication he began to dance in the courtyard of the 










shrine. Every now and then his body stood transfixed in deep samadhi. Hundreds of people around 










him shouted the name of God, and thousands outside caught the strain and raised the cry with 










full-throated voices. The echo travelled over the Ganges, striking a note in the hearts of people in 










the boats on the holy river, and they too chanted the name of God. 



















When the kirtan was over, Mani Sen took Sri Ramakrishna and Navadvip Goswami into a 










room and served them with refreshments. Afterwards Ram, M., and the other devotees were also 










served with the prasad. 



















In the afternoon, the Master was sitting in Mani Sen's drawing-room with the devotees. 










Navadvip was also near him. Mani offered the carriage hire to Sri Ramakrishna. Pointing to Ram 





































and the others, the Master said: "Why should they accept it from you? They earn money." He 










became engaged in conversation with Navadvip. 



















DIFFERENT STATES OF BHAKTI 



















MASTER: "Bhakti matured becomes bhava. Next is mahabhava, then prema, and last of all is 










the attainment of God. Gauranga experienced the states of mahabhava and prema. When prema 










is awakened, a devotee completely forgets the world; he also forgets his body, which is so dear to 










a man. Gauranga experienced prema. He jumped into the ocean, thinking it to be the Jamuna. 










The ordinary jiva does not experience mahabhava or prema. He goes only as far as bhava. But 










Gauranga experienced all three states. Isn't that so?" 



















NAVADVIP: "Yes, sir, that is true. The inmost state, the semi-conscious state, and the 










conscious state." 



















MASTER: "In the inmost state he would remain in samadhi, unconscious of the outer world. 










In the semi-conscious state he could only dance. In the conscious state he chanted the name of 










God." 



















Navadvip introduced his son to the Master. The young man was a student of the scriptures. 










He saluted Sri Ramakrishna. 



















NAVADVIP: "He studies the scriptures at home. Previously one hardly saw a copy of the 










Vedas in this country. Max Muller has translated them; so people can now read these books." 



















ESSENCE OF THE SCRIPTURES 



















MASTER: "Too much study of the scriptures does more harm than good. The important 










thing is to know the essence of the scriptures. After that, what is the need of books? One should 










learn the essence and then dive deep in order to realize God. 



















IDEAL OF THE GITA 



















"The Divine Mother has revealed to me the essence of the Vedanta. It is that Brahman 










alone is real and the world illusory. The essence of the Gita is what you get by repeating the word 










ten times. The word becomes reversed. It is then 'tagi', which refers to renunciation. The essence 










of the Gita is: '0 man, renounce everything and practise spiritual discipline for the realization of 










God.' " 



















NAVADVIP: "But how can we persuade our minds to renounce?" 



















MASTER: "You are a goswami. It is your duty to officiate as priest in the temple. You cannot 










renounce the world; otherwise, who would look after the temple and its services? You have to 










renounce mentally. 



















"It is God Himself who has kept you in the world to set an example to men. You may resolve 










in your mind a thousand times to renounce the world, but you will not succeed. God has given you 










such a nature that you must perform your worldly duties. 





































"Krishna said to Arjuna: 'What do you mean, you will not fight? By your mere will you 










cannot desist from fighting. Your very nature will make you fight.' " 



















At the mere mention of Krishna and Arjuna the Master went into samadhi. In the twinkling 










of an eye his body became motionless and his eyeballs transfixed, while his breathing could 










scarcely be noticed. At this sudden transformation Navadvip and his son and the other devotees 










looked at the Master in mute wonder. 



















Regaining partial consciousness, he said to Navadvip: "Yoga and bhoga. You goswamis have 










both. Now your only duty is to call on God and pray to Him sincerely: '0 God, I don't want the 










glories of Thy world-bewitching maya. I want Thee alone!' God dwells in all beings, undoubtedly. 










That being the case, who may be called His devotee? He who dwells in God, he who has merged 










his mind and life and innermost soul in God." 



















The Master returned to the sense plane. Referring to his samadhi, he said to Navadvip: 










"Some say that this state of mine is a disease. I say to them, 'How can one become unconscious by 










thinking of Him whose Consciousness has made the whole world conscious?' " 



















Mani Sen said good-bye to the invited brahmins and Vaishnavas with suitable gifts of 










money. He offered five rupees to Sri Ramakrishna. The latter said that he could not possibly accept 










any money. But Mani insisted. The Master then asked him in the name of his guru not to press 










him. Mani requested him again to accept the offering. Sri Ramakrishna asked M., in a distressed 










voice, whether he should take the money. The disciple made a vehement protest and said, "No, sir. 










By no means." 



















Friends of Mani Sen gave the money to Rakhal , requesting him to buy some mangoes and 










sweets for the Master. Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "I have definitely said to Mani that I would not 










accept the money. I feel free now. But Rakhal has accepted it. His is now the responsibility." 



















Sri Ramakrishna, accompanied by the devotees, took a carriage to return to Dakshineswar. 










They were going to pass the temple garden of Mati Seal on the way. For a long time the Master 










had been asking M. to take him to the reservoir in the garden in order that he might teach him 










how to meditate on the formless God. There were tame fish in the reservoir. Nobody harmed 










them. Visitors threw puffed rice and other bits of food into the water, and the big fish came in 










swarms to eat the food. Fearlessly the fish swam in the water and sported there joyously. 



















Coming to the reservoir, the Master said to M.: "Look at the fish. Meditating on the 










formless God is like swimming joyfully like these fish, in the Ocean of Bliss and Consciousness." 



















Monday, June 25, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna was at Balaram Bose's house in Calcutta. Rakhal and M. were seated near 










him. The Master was in ecstasy. He conversed with the devotees in an abstracted mood. 



















MASTER: "Let me assure you that a man can realize his Inner Self through sincere prayer. 










But to the extent that he has the desire to enjoy worldly objects, his vision of the Self becomes 










obstructed." 





































M: "Yes, sir. You always ask us to plunge into God." 



















MASTER (joyously): "Yes! That's it. Let me tell you that the realization of Self is possible for 










all, without any exception." 



















M: "That is true, sir. But God is the Doer. He works through different beings in different 










ways, according to their capacity to manifest the Divine. God gives to some full spiritual 










consciousness, and others He keeps in ignorance." 



















MASTER: "No, that is not so. One should pray to God with a longing heart. God certainly 










listens to prayer if it is sincere. There is no doubt about it." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Yes, sir. There is this 'l-consciousness' in us; therefore we must pray." 










NITYA AND LILA 



















MASTER (to M.): "A man should reach the Nitya, the Absolute, by following the trail of the 










Lila, the Relative. It is like reaching the roof by the stairs. After realizing the Absolute, he should 










climb down to the Relative and live on that plane in the company of devotees, charging his mind 










with the love of God. This is my final and most mature opinion. 



















"God has different forms, and He sports in different ways. He sports as Isvara, deva, man, 










and the universe. In every age He descends to earth in human form, as an Incarnation, to teach 










people love and devotion. There is the instance of Chaitanya. One can taste devotion and love of 










God only through His Incarnations. Infinite are the ways of God's play, but what I need is love and 










devotion. I want only the milk. The milk comes through the udder of the cow. The Incarnation is 










the udder." 



















Was Sri Ramakrislma hinting that he was an Incarnation of God? Did he suggest that those 










who saw him saw God? Did he thus speak about himself when speaking of Chaitanya? 



















It was a hot day in June 1883. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of the Siva temples in 










the temple garden. M. arrived with ice and other offerings and sat down on the steps after saluting 










the Master. 



















MASTER (to M.): "The husband of Mani Mallick's granddaughter was here. He read in a 










book that God could not be said to be quite wise and omniscient; otherwise, why should there be 










so much misery in the world? As regards death, it would be much better to kill a man all at once, 










instead of putting him through slow torture. Further, the author writes that if he himself were the 










Creator, he would have created a better world." 



















M. listened to these words in surprise and made no comment. 



















THE WAYS OF GOD ARE INSCRUTABLE 



















MASTER (to M.): "Can a man ever understand God's ways? I too think of God sometimes as 










good and sometimes as bad. He has kept us deluded by His great illusion. Sometimes He wakes us 










up and sometimes He keeps us unconscious. One moment the ignorance disappears, and the next 










moment it covers our mind. If you throw a brick-bat into a pond covered with moss, you get a 





































glimpse of the water. But a few moments later the moss comes dancing back and covers the 










water. 



















BODY-CONSCIOUSNESS PRODUCES DUALITY 



















"One is aware of pleasure and pain, birth and death, disease and grief, as long as one is 










identified with the body. All these belong to the body alone, and not to the Soul. After the death of 










the body, perhaps God carries one to a better place. It is like the birth of the child after the pain of 










delivery. Attaining Self-Knowledge, one looks on pleasure and pain, birth and death, as a dream. 



















"How little we know! Can a one-seer pot hold ten seers of milk? If ever a salt doll ventures 










into the ocean to measure its depth, it cannot come back and give us the information. It melts into 










the water and disappears." 



















At dusk the evening service began in the different temples. The Master was sitting on the 










small couch in his room, absorbed in contemplation of the Divine Mother. Several devotees also 










were there. M. was going to spend the night with the Master. 



















A little later Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to a devotee privately, on the verandah north of 










his room. He said: "It is good to meditate in the small hours of the morning and at dawn. One 










should also meditate daily after dusk." He instructed the devotee about meditation on the 










Personal God and on the Impersonal Reality. 



















After a time he sat on the semicircular porch west of his room. It was about nine o'clock. 



















MASTER: "Those who come here will certainly have all their doubts removed. What do you 



















say?" 



















M: "That is true, sir." 



















A boat was moving in the Ganges, far away from the bank. The boatman began to sing. The 










sound of his voice floating over the river reached the Master's ears, and he went into a spiritual 










mood. The hair on his body stood on end. He said to M., "Just feel my body." 



















M. was greatly amazed. He thought: "The Upanishads describe Brahman as permeating the 










universe and the ether. Has that Brahman, as sound, touched the Master's body?" 



















After a time Sri Ramakrishna began to converse again. 



















MASTER: "Those who come here must have been born with good tendencies. Isn't that 



















true?" 



















M: "It is true, sir." MASTER: "Adhar must have good tendencies." 










M: "That goes without saying." 



















M: "That is true, sir. If a thread has a single fibre sticking out, it cannot pass through the eye 










of a needle." 





































MASTER: "If a man finds a hair in the food he is chewing, he spits out the entire morsel." 



















M: "But you say that the man who has realized God cannot be injured by evil company. A 










blazing fire burns up even a plantain-tree." 



















Saturday, July 14, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna arrived at Adhar's house in Calcutta. Rakhal, M., and other devotees were 










with the Master. Adhar had arranged to have Rajnaraya, the famous singer, and his party, recite 










the Chandi. 



















Rajnarayan began the recital in the worship hall. He sang: 



















I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the Mother; Am I afraid of Death 










anymore? . . . 



















As the Master listened, he became filled with divine fervour and joined the musicians. Now 










and then he improvised an appropriate line. Suddenly he went into samadhi and stood still. 



















The singer sang again: 



















Who is the Woman yonder who lights the field of battle? Darker Her body gleams even than 










the darkest storm-cloud, And from Her teeth there flash the lightning's blinding flames! 










Dishevelled Her hair is flying behind as She rushes about, Undaunted in this war between the gods 










and the demons. Laughing Her terrible laugh, She slays the fleeing asuras, And with Her dazzling 










flashes She bares the horror of war. How beautiful on Her brow the drops of moisture appear! 










About Her dense black hair the bees are buzzing in swarms; The moon has veiled its face, 










beholding this Sea of Beauty. Tell me, who can She be, this Sorceress? Wonder of wonders! Siva 










Himself, like a corpse, lies vanquished at Her feet. Kamalakanta has guessed who She is, with the 










elephant's gait; 



















She is none other than Kali, Mother of all the worlds. Sri Ramakrishna was in deep samadhi. 










Saturday, July 21, 1883 



















It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when Sri Ramakrishna, with Ramlal and one or 










two other devotees, started from Dakshineswar for Calcutta in a carriage. As the carriage passed 










the gate of the Kali temple, they met M. coming on foot with four mangoes in his hand. The 










carriage stopped and M. saluted the Master. Sri Ramakrishna was going to visit some of his 










devotees in Calcutta. 



















MASTER (to M., with a smile): "Come with us. We are going to Adhar's house." 



















M. got joyfully into the carriage. Having received an English education, he did not believe in 










the tendencies inherited from previous births. But he had admitted a few days before that it was 










on account of Adhar's good tendencies from past births that he showed such great devotion to the 










Master. Later on he had thought about this subject and had discovered that he was not yet 










completely convinced about inherited tendencies. He had come to Dakshineswar that day to 










discuss the matter with Sri Ramakrishna. 





































MASTER: "Well, what do you think of Adhar?" 



















M: "He has great yearning for God." 



















MASTER: "Adhar, too, speaks very highly of you." 



















M. remained silent awhile and then began to speak of past tendencies. 



















M: "I haven't much faith in rebirth and inherited tendencies. Will that in any way injure my 










devotion to God?" 



















EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE FOR GOD 



















MASTER: "It is enough to believe that all is possible in God's creation. Never allow the 










thought to cross your mind that your ideas are the only true ones, and that those of others are 










false. Then God will explain everything. 



















"What can a man understand of God's activities? The facets of God's creation are infinite. 










I do not try to understand God's actions at all. I have heard that everything is possible in God's 










creation, and I always bear that in mind. Therefore I do not give a thought to the world, but 










meditate on God alone. Once Hanuman was asked, 'What day of the lunar month is it?' Hanuman 










said: 'I don't know anything about the day of the month, the position of the moon and stars, or any 










such things. I think of Rama alone.' 



















"Can one ever understand the work of God? He is so near; still it is not possible for us to 










know Him. Balarama did not realize that Krishna was God." 



















M: "That is true, sir." 



















MAYA IS THE CAUSE OF IGNORANCE 



















MASTER: "God has covered all with His maya. He doesn't let us know anything. Maya is 










'woman and gold'. He who puts maya aside to see God, can see Him. Once, when I was explaining 










God's actions to someone, God suddenly showed me the lake at Kamarpukur. I saw a man 










removing the green scum and drinking the water. The water was clear as crystal. God revealed to 










me that Satchidananda is covered by the scum of maya. He who puts the green scum aside can 










drink the water. 



















"Let me tell you a very secret experience. Once I had entered the wood near the pine-grove, 










and was sitting there, when I had a vision of something like the hidden door of a chamber. I 










couldn't see the inside of the chamber. I tried to bore a hole in the door with a nail-knife, but did 










not succeed. As I bored, the earth fell back into the hole and filled it. Then suddenly I made a very 










big opening." 



















Uttering these words, the Master remained silent. After a time he said: "These are very 










profound words. I feel as if someone were pressing my mouth. ... I have seen with my own eyes 










that God dwells even in the sexual organ. I saw Him once in the sexual intercourse of a dog and a 










bitch. 





































"The universe is conscious on account of the Consciousness of God. Sometimes I find that 










this Consciousness wriggles about, as it were, even in small fish." 



















The carriage came to the crossing at Shovabazar in Calcutta. The Master continued, saying, 










"Sometimes I find that the universe is saturated with the Consciousness of God, as the earth is 










soaked with water in the rainy season. 



















"Well, I see so many visions, but I never feel vain about them." 



















M. (with a smile): "That you should speak of vanity, sir!" 



















MASTER: "Upon my word, I don't feel vanity even in the slightest degree." 



















M: "There once lived a man in Greece, Socrates by name. A voice from heaven said that he 










was wise among men. Socrates was amazed at this revelation. He meditated on it a long time in 










solitude and then realized its significance. He said to his friends, 'I alone of all people have 










understood that I do not know anything.' But every man believes he is wise. In reality all are 










ignorant." 



















MASTER: "Now and then I think, 'What is it I know that makes so many people come to 



















me?' Vaishnavcharan was a great pundit. He used to say to me: 'I can find in the scriptures all the 



















things you talk about. But do you know why I come to you? I come to hear them from your mouth.' 










ii 



















M: "All your words tally with the scriptures. Navadvip Goswami also said that the other day 










at the festival at Panihati. You told us that day that by repeating the word 'Gita' a number of times 










one reverses it and it becomes 'tagi', which refers to renunciation. 



















Renunciation is the essence of the Gita. Navadvip Goswami supported your statement from 










the grammatical standpoint." 



















MASTER: "Have you found anyone else resembling me-any pundit or holy man?" 



















M: "God has created you with His own hands, whereas He has made others by machine. All 










others He has created according to law." 



















MASTER (laughing, to Ramlal and the other devotees): "Listen to what he is saying!" 



















Sri Ramakrishna laughed for some time, and said at last. "Really and truly I have no 










pride-no, not even the slightest bit." 





































M: "Knowledge does us good in one respect at least; it makes us feel that we do not know 










anything, that we are nothing." 



















MASTER: "Right you are! I am nothing. I am nobody. "Do you believe in English astronomy?" 





































M: "It is possible to make new discoveries by applying the laws of Western astronomy. 










Observing the irregular movement of Uranus, the astronomers looked through their telescopes 










and discovered Neptune shining in the sky. They can also foretell eclipses." 



















MASTER: "Yes, that is so." 



















Master's visits to various devotees 



















The carriage drove on. They were approaching Adhar's house. Sri Ramakrishna said to M., 










"Dwell in the truth and you will certainly realize God." 



















M: "You said the other day to Navadvip Goswami:'0 God, I want Thee. Please do not delude 










me with Thy world-bewitching maya. I want to realize Thee.' " 



















MASTER: "Yes, one should be able to say that from one's innermost soul." Sri Ramakrishna 










arrived at Adhar's house and took a seat in the parlour. Ramlal, Adhar, M., and the other devotees 










sat near him. Rakhal was staying with his father in Calcutta. 



















MASTER (to Adhar): "Didn't you let Rakhal know that I was coming?" ADHAR: "Yes, sir. I 










have sent him word." Finding that the Master was eager to see Rakhal , Adhar at once sent his 










carriage to fetch him. Adhar had been yearning to see the Master that day, but he had not 










definitely known that Sri Ramakrishna was coming. ADHAR: "You haven't been here for a long 










time. I prayed to God today that you might come. I even shed tears" 



















The Master was pleased and said with a smile, "You don't mean that!" 



















It was dusk and the lamps were lighted. Sri Ramakrishna saluted the Divine Mother with 










folded hands and sat quietly absorbed in meditation. Then he began to chant the names of God in 










his sweet voice: "Govinda! Govinda! Satchidananda! Hari! Hari!" Every word he uttered showered 










nectar on the ears of the devotees. 



















Ramlal sang in praise of Kali, the Divine Mother: 



















Thy name, I have heard, Consort of Siva, is the destroyer of our fear, And so on Thee I cast 










my burden: Save me! Save me, kindly Mother! Out of Thy womb the world is born, and Thou it is 










that dost pervade it. Art Thou Kali? Art Thou Radha? Who can ever rightly say? Mother, in every 










living creature Thou dost have Thy dwelling place; As Kundalini Thou dost live in the lotus of the 










Muladhara. Above it lies the Svadhisthana, where the four-petalled lotus blooms; There also Thou 










dost make Thy home, mystic power of Kundalini, In the four petals of that flower, and in 










Vajrasana's six petals At the navel is Manipura, the blue ten-petalled lotus flower; Through the 










pathway of Sushumna, Thou dost ascend and enter there. Lady of the lotuses, in lotus blossoms 










Thou dost dwell! Beyond them lies the Lake of Nectar, in the region of the heart, where the 










twelve-petalled lotus flower enchants the eye with scarlet flame. When Thou dost open it, 










Mother, touching it with Thy Lotus Feet, The age-long darkness of the heart instantly scatters at 










Thy sight. Above, in the throat, is the sixteen-petalled lotus flower, of smoky hue; within the petals 










of this flower there lies concealed a subtle space, transcending which, one sees at length the 










universe in Space dissolve. And higher yet, between the eyebrows, blossoms the lotus of two 





































petals, where the mind of man remains a prisoner and past controlling; from this flower the mind 










desires to watch the sportive play of life. 



















Highest of all, within the head, the soul-enthralling centre is, where shines the 










thousand-petalled lotus, Mahadeva's dwelling place. Having ascended to His throne, Spouse of 










Siva, sit beside Him! Thou art the Primal Power, Mother! She whose senses are controlled; the 










yogis meditate on Thee as Uma, great Himalaya's daughter. Thou who art the Power of Siva! Put to 










death my ceaseless cravings; Grant that I never fall again into the ocean of this world. Mother, 










Thou art the Primal Power, Thou the five cosmic principles; who can ever hope to know Thee, who 










art beyond all principles? Only for Thy bhaktas' sake dost Thou assume Thy various forms; but 










when Thy devotee's five senses merge in the five elements, Mother, it is Thyself alone that he 










beholds as formless Truth. 



















As Ramlal sang the lines: 



















Above, in the throat, is the sixteen-petalled lotus flower, of smoky hue; within the petals of 










this flower there lies concealed a subtle space, transcending which, one sees at length the universe 










in Space dissolve, 



















The Master said to M.: "Listen. This is known as the vision of Satchidananda, the Formless 










Brahman. The Kundalini, rising above the Visuddha chakra, enables one to see everything as 










Akasa." 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "One attains the Absolute by going beyond the universe and its created beings 










conjured up by maya. By passing beyond the Nada one goes into samadhi. By repeating 'Om' one 










goes beyond the Nada and attains samadhi." 



















Adhar served Sri Ramakrishna with fruits and sweets. The Master left for Jadu Mallick's 



















house. 



















Sri Ramakrishna entered the room in Jadu's house where the Divine Mother was 










worshipped. He stood before the image, which had been decorated with flowers, garlands, and 










sandal-paste, and which radiated a heavenly beauty and splendour. Lights were burning before the 










pedestal. A priest was seated before the image. The Master asked one of his companions to offer a 










rupee in the shrine, according to the Hindu custom. 



















Sri Ramakrishna stood a long time with folded hands before the blissful image, the devotees 










standing behind him. Gradually he went into samadhi, his body becoming motionless and his eyes 










fixed. 



















With a long sigh he came back to the world of the senses and said, still intoxicated with 










divine fervour, "Mother, good-bye." But he could not leave the place. He remained standing there. 










Addressing Ramlal, he said: "Please sing that song. Then I shall be all right." 



















Ramlal sang: 



















Mother, Consort of Siva, Thou hast deluded this world. . . . 





































The Master went to the drawing-room with the devotees. Every now and then he said, "0 










Mother, please dwell in my heart." Jadu was sitting in the drawing-room with his friends. The 










Master sat down, still in an ecstatic mood, and sang: 



















Mother, ever blissful as Thou art, do not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss! . . . 



















Finishing the song, he said to Jadu, still in a state of divine fervour: "Well, sir, what shall I 










sing? Shall I sing 'Mother, am I Thine eight-months child'? " 



















He sang: 



















Mother, am I Thine eight-months child? Thy red eyes cannot frighten me! My riches are Thy 










Lotus Feet, which Siva holds upon His breast; Yet, when I seek my heritage, I meet with excuses 










and delays. A deed of gift I hold in my heart, attested by Thy Husband Siva; I shall sue Thee, if I 










must, and with a single point shall win. If Thou dost oppose me, Thou wilt learn what sort of 










mother's son I am. This bitterly contested suit between the Mother and Her son- What sport it is! 










says Ramprasad. I shall not cease tormenting Thee Till Thou Thyself, shalt yield the fight and take 










me in Thine arms at last. 



















Coming down nearly to a normal state, the Master said, "I shall take some of the Divine 










Mother's prasad." Then he ate a little of it. 



















Jadu Mallick was sitting near him with several friends, among whom were a few of his 










flatterers. 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Well, why do you keep these buffoons with you?" 



















JADU (with a smile): "Suppose they are. Won't you redeem them?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "The water of the Ganges cannot purify a wine-jar." 



















Jadu had promised the Master that he would arrange a recital of the Chandi in his house. 










Some time had elapsed, but he had not yet kept his promise. 



















MASTER: "Well, what about the recital of the Chandi?" 



















JADU: "I have been busy with many things; I haven't been able to arrange it." 



















MASTER: "How is that? A man gives his word and doesn't take it back! 'The words of a man 










are like the tusks of the elephant: they come out but do not go back.' A man must be true to his 










word. What do you say?" 



















JADU (with a smile): "You are right." 



















MASTER: "You are a shrewd man. You do a thing after much calculation. You are like the 










brahmin who selects a cow that eats very little, supplies plenty of dung, and gives much milk." (All 










laugh.) 



















After a time he said to Jadu: "I now understand your nature. It is half warm and half cold. 










You are devoted to God and also to the world." 





































The Master and his devotees were served by Jadu with sweets and fruit, and then the party 










left for the home of Khelat Ghosh. 



















Khelat Ghosh's house was a big mansion, but it looked deserted. As the Master entered the 










house he fell into an ecstatic mood. M., Ramlal, and a few other devotees were with him. Their 










host was Khelat Ghosh's brother-in-law. He was an old man, a Vaishnava. His body was stamped 










with the name of God, according to the Vaishnava custom, and he carried in his hand a small bag 










containing his rosary. He had visited the Master, now and then, at Dakshineswar. But most of the 










Vaishnavas held narrow religious views; they criticized the Vedantists and the followers of the Siva 










cult. Sri Ramakrishna soon began to speak. 



















DOGMATISM CONDEMNED 



















MASTER: "It is not good to feel that one's own religion alone is true and all others are false. 










God is one only, and not two. Different people call on Him by different names: some as Allah, 










some as God, and others as Krishna, Siva, and Brahman. It is like the water in a lake. Some drink it 










at one place and call it 'jal', others at another place and call it 'pani', and still others at a third place 










and call it 'water'. The Hindus call it 'jal', the Christians 'water', and the Mussalmans 'pani'. But it is 










one and the same thing. Opinions are but paths. Each religion is only a path leading to God, as 










rivers come from different directions and ultimately become one in the one ocean. 



















ONENESS OF GOD 



















"The Truth established in the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras is but one Satchidananda. 










In the Vedas It is called Brahman, in the Puranas It is called Krishna, Rama, and so on, and in the 










Tantras It is called Siva. The one Satchidananda is called Brahman, Krishna, and Siva." 



















The devotees were silent. 



















A VAISHNAVA DEVOTEE: "Sir, why should one think of God at all" 



















MASTER: "If a man really has that knowledge, then he is indeed liberated though living in a 



















body. 



















SHALLOW FAITH OF THE WORLDLY-MINDED 



















"Not all, by any means, believe in God. They simply talk. The worldly-minded have heard 










from someone that God exists and that everything happens by His will; but it is not their inner 










belief. 



















"Do you know what a worldly man's idea of God is like? It is like the children's swearing by 










God when they quarrel. They have heard the word while listening to their elderly aunts quarreling. 



















"Is it possible for all to comprehend God? God has created the good and the bad, the 










devoted and the impious, the faithful and the sceptical. The wonders that we see all exist in His 










creation. In one place there is more manifestation of His Power, in another less. The sun's light is 










better reflected by water than by earth, and still better by a mirror. Again, there are different 





































levels among the devotees of God: superior, mediocre, and inferior. All this has been described in 










theGita." 



















VAISHNAVA: "True, sir." 



















VARIOUS CLASSES OF DEVOTEES 



















MASTER: "The inferior devotee says, 'God exists, but He is very far off, up there in heaven.' 










The mediocre devotee says, 'God exists in all beings as life and consciousness.' The superior 










devotee says: 'It is God Himself who has become everything; whatever I see is only a form of God. 










It is He alone who has become maya, the universe, and all living beings. Nothing exists but God.' " 



















VAISHNAVA: "Does anyone ever attain that state of mind?" 










SIGNS OF GOD-VISION 



















MASTER: "One cannot attain it unless one has seen God. But there are signs that a man has 










had the vision of God. A man who has seen God sometimes behaves like a madman: he laughs, 










weeps, dances, and sings. Sometimes he behaves like a child, a child five years old-guileless, 










generous, without vanity, unattached to anything, not under the control of any of the gunas, 










always blissful. Sometimes he behaves like a ghoul: he doesn't differentiate between things pure 










and things impure; he sees no difference between things clean and things unclean. And sometimes 










he is like an inert thing, staring vacantly: he cannot do any work; he cannot strive for anything." 



















Was the Master making a veiled reference to his own states of mind? 



















KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE 



















MASTER (to the Vaishnava devotee): "The feeling of 'Thee and Thine' is the outcome of 










Knowledge; 'I and mine' comes from ignorance. Knowledge makes one feel: '0 God, Thou art the 










Doer and I am Thy instrument. God, to Thee belongs all-body, mind, house, family, living beings, 










and the universe. All these are Thine. Nothing belongs to me.' 



















"An ignorant person says, 'Oh, God is there-very far off.' The man of Knowledge knows that 










God is right here, very near, in the heart; that He has assumed all forms and dwells in all hearts as 










their Inner Controller." 



















Sunday, July 22, 1883 



















Taking advantage of the holiday, many householder devotees visited Sri Ramakrishna in his 










room at the Dakshineswar temple garden. The Young devotees, mostly students, generally came 










on week-days. Sometimes the Master asked his intimate disciples to come on a Tuesday or a 










Saturday, days that he considered very auspicious for special religious instruction. Adhar, Rakhal , 










and M. had come from Calcutta in a hired carriage. 



















Sri Ramakrishna had enjoyed a little rest after his midday meal. The room had an 










atmosphere of purity and holiness. On the walls hung pictures of gods and goddesses, among 










them one of Christ rescuing the drowning Peter. Outside the room were plants laden with fragrant 










flowers, and the Ganges could be seen flowing toward the south. The Master was seated on the 





































small couch, facing the north, and the devotees sat on mats and carpets spread on the floor. All 










eyes were directed toward him. Mani Mallick, an old Brahmo devotee about sixty-five years of age, 










came to pay his respects to the Master. He had returned a few months earlier from a pilgrimage to 










Benares and was recounting his experiences to Sri Ramakrishna. 



















DIFFICULTY OF THE VEDANTIC METHOD 



















MANI MALLICK: "A monk whom I met in Benares said that no religious experience is 










possible without the control of the sense-organs. Nothing could be achieved by merely crying, 










'God! God!'" 



















MASTER: "Do you understand the views of teachers like him? According to them, one must 










first practise spiritual discipline: self-restraint, self-control, forbearance, and the like. Their aim is 










to attain Nirvana. They are followers of Vedanta. They constantly discriminate, saying, 'Brahman 










alone is real, and the world illusory.' But this is an extremely difficult path. If the world is illusory, 










then you too are illusory. The teacher who gives the instruction is equally illusory. His words, too, 










are as illusory as a dream. 



















"But this experience is beyond the reach of the ordinary man. Do you know what it is like? If 










you burn camphor nothing remains. When wood is burnt at least a little ash is left. Finally, after 










the last analysis, the devotee goes into samadhi. Then he knows nothing whatsoever of T, 'you', or 










the universe. 



















"Padmalochan was a man of deep wisdom. He had great respect for me, though at that 










time I constantly repeated the name of the Divine Mother. He was the court pundit of the 










Maharaja of Burdwan. Once he came to Calcutta and went to live in a garden house near 










kamarhati. I felt a desire to see him and sent Hriday there to learn if the pundit had any vanity. I 










was told that he had none. Then I met him. Though a man of great knowledge and scholarship, he 










began to weep on hearing me sing Ramprasad's devotional songs. We talked together a long while; 










conversation with nobody else gave me such satisfaction. He said to me, 'Give up the desire for the 










company of devotees; otherwise people of all sorts will come to you and make you deviate from 










your spiritual ideal.' Once he entered into a controversy, by correspondence, with Utshavananda, 










Vaishnavcharan's guru. He told me an interesting incident. Once a meeting was called to decide 










which of the two deities, Siva or Brahma, was the greater. Unable to come to any decision, the 










pundits at last referred the matter to Padmalochan. With characteristic guilelessness he said: 'How 










do I know? Neither I nor any of my ancestors back to the fourteenth generation have seen Siva or 










Brahma.' About the renunciation of 'woman and gold', he said to me one day: 'Why have you given 










up those things? Such distinctions as "This is money and that is clay" are the outcome of 










ignorance.' What could I say to that? I replied: 'I don't know all these things, my dear sir. But for 










my part, I cannot relish such things as money and the like.' 



















"There was a pundit who was tremendously vain. He did not believe in the forms of God. 










But who can understand the inscrutable ways of the Divine? God revealed Himself to him as the 










Primal Power. This vision made the pundit unconscious for a long time. After regaining partial 










consciousness he uttered only the sound 'Ka! Ka! Ka!' He could not fully pronounce 'Kali'." 





































A DEVOTEE: "Sir, you met Pundit Vidyasagar. What did you think of him?" 



















MASTER: "Vidyasagar has both scholarship and charity, but he lacks inner vision. Gold lies 










hidden within him. Had he but found it out, his activities would have been reduced; finally they 










would have stopped altogether. Had he but known that God resides in his heart, his mind would 










have been directed to God in thought and meditation. Some persons must perform selfless work a 










long time before they can practise dispassion and direct their minds to the spiritual ideal and at 










last be absorbed in God. 



















CHARITY AND ATTACHMENT 



















"The activities that Vidyasagar is engaged in are good. Charity is very noble. There is a great 










deal of difference between daya, compassion, and maya, attachment. Daya is good, but not maya. 










Maya is love for one's relatives-one's wife, children, brother, sister, nephew, father, and mother. 










But daya is the same love for all created beings without any distinction." 



















M: "Is daya also a bondage?" 










THE THREE GUNAS 



















MASTER: "Yes, it is. But that concept is something far beyond the ordinary man. Daya 










springs from sattva. Sattva preserves, rajas creates, and tamas destroys. But Brahman is beyond 










the three gunas. It is beyond Prakriti. 



















"None of the three gunas can reach Truth; they are like robbers, who cannot come to a 










public place for fear of being arrested. Sattva, rajas, and tamas are like so many robbers. 



















"Listen to a story. Once a man was going through a forest, when three robbers fell upon him 










and robbed him of all his possessions. One of the robbers said, 'What's the use of keeping this man 










alive?' So saying, he was about to kill him with his sword, when the second robber interrupted him, 










saying: 'Oh, no! What is the use of killing him? Tie him hand and foot and leave him here.' The 










robbers bound his hands and feet and went away. 



















After a while the third robber returned and said to the man: 'Ah, I am sorry. Are you hurt? I 










will release you from your bonds.' After setting the man free, the thief said: 'Come with me. I will 










take you to the public highway.' After a long time they reached the road. Then the robber said: 










'Follow this road. Over there is your house.' At this the man said: 'Sir, you have been very good to 










me. Come with me to my house ' 'Oh, no!' the robber replied. 'I can't go there. The police will 










know it.' 



















This world itself is the forest. The three robbers prowling here are sattva, rajas, and tamas. 










It is they that rob a man of the Knowledge of Truth. Tamas wants to destroy him. Rajas binds him 










to the world. But sattva rescues him from the clutches of rajas and tamas. Under the protection of 










sattva, man is rescued from anger, passion, and the other evil effects of tamas. Further, sattva 










loosens the bonds of the world. But sattva also is a robber. It cannot give him the ultimate 










Knowledge of Truth, though it shows him the road leading to the Supreme Abode of God. Setting 





































him on the path, sattva tells him: 'Look yonder. There is your home.' Even sattva is far away from 










the Knowledge of Brahman. 



















NATURE OF BRAHMAN CANNOT HE DESCRIBED 



















"What Brahman is cannot be described. Even he who knows It cannot talk about It. There is 










a saying that a boat, once reaching the 'black waters' of the ocean, cannot come back. 



















PARABLE OF THE FOUR FRIENDS 



















"Once four friends, in the course of a walk, saw a place enclosed by a wall. The wall was 










very high. They all became eager to know what was inside. One of them climbed to the top of the 










wall. What he saw on looking inside made him speechless with wonder. He only cried, 'Ah! Ah!' and 










dropped in. He could not give any information about what he saw. The others, too, climbed the 










wall, uttered the same cry, 'Ah! Ah!', and jumped in. Now who could tell what was inside? 



















"Sages like Jadabharata and Dattatreya, after realizing Brahman, could not describe It. A 










man's T completely disappears when he goes into samadhi after attaining the Knowledge of 










Brahman. That is why Ramprasad sang, addressing his mind: 



















If you should find the task too hard, call upon Ramprasad for help. 



















The mind must completely merge itself in Knowledge. But that is not enough. 'Ramprasad', 










that is, the principle of T, must vanish too. Then alone does one get the Knowledge of Brahman." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, is it possible then that Sukadeva did not have the ultimate Knowledge?" 



















MASTER: "According to some people, Sukadeva only saw and touched the Ocean of 










Brahman; he did not dive into It. That is why he could return to the world and impart religious 










instruction. According to others, he returned to the world of name and form, after attaining the 










Knowledge of Brahman, for the purpose of teaching others. He had to recite the Bhagavata to King 










Parikshit and had to teach people in various ways; therefore God did not destroy his T altogether. 










God kept in him the 'ego of Knowledge.'" 



















GOD AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION 



















DEVOTEE: "Can one keep up an organization after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman?" 



















MASTER: "Once I talked to Keshab Sen about the Knowledge of Brahman. He asked me to 










explain it further. I said, 'If I proceed further, then you won't be able to preserve your organization 










and following.' 'Then please stop here!' replied Keshab. (All laugh.) But still I said to Keshab: ' "I" 










and "mine" indicate ignorance. Without ignorance one cannot have such a feeling as "I am the 










doer; these are my wife, children, possessions, name and fame".' Thereupon Keshab said, 'Sir, if 










one gave up the "I", nothing whatsoever would remain.' I reassured him and said: 'I am not asking 










you to give up all of the "I". You should give up only the "unripe I". The "unripe I" makes one feel: 










"I am the doer. These are my wife and children. I am a teacher." Renounce this, "unripe I" and 










keep the "ripe I", which will make you feel that you are the servant of God, His devotee, and that 










God is the Doer and you are His instrument.' " 





































DEVOTEE: "Can the 'ripe I' form an organization?" 










TWO KINDS OF EGO 



















MASTER: "I said to Keshab Sen that the T that says, 'I am a leader, I have formed this party, 










I am teaching people', is the 'unripe I'. It is very difficult to preach religion. It is not possible to do 










so without receiving the commandment of God. The permission of God is necessary. Shukadeva 










had a command from God to recite the Bhagavata. If, after realizing God, a man gets His command 










and becomes a preacher or teacher, then that preaching or teaching does no harm. His T is not 










'unripe'; it is 'ripe'. 



















"I asked Keshab to give up this 'unripe I'. The ego that feels, 'I am the servant of God and 










lover of God' does not injure one. I said to him: 'You have been constantly talking of your 










organization and your followers. But people also go away from your organization.' Keshab 










answered: 'It is true, sir. After staying in it several years, people go to another organization. What 










is worse, on deserting me they abuse me right and left.' 'Why don't you study their nature?' I said. 










'Is there any good in making anybody and everybody a disciple?' 



















"I said to Keshab further: 'You should accept the Divine Mother, the Primal Energy. 










Brahman is not different from Its Sakti. What is Brahman is also Sakti. As long as a man remains 










conscious of the body, he is conscious of duality. It is only when a man tries to describe what he 










sees that he finds duality.' Keshab later on recognized Kali. 



















"One day when Keshab was here with his disciples, I said to him that I would like to hear 










him preach. He delivered a lecture in the chandni. Then we all sat by the bathing-ghat and had a 










long conversation. I said to him: 'It is Bhagavan alone who in one form appears as bhakta, and in 










another as the Bhagavata. Please repeat "Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan".' Keshab and his disciples 










repeated the words. Then I asked him to repeat 'Guru-Krishna-Vaishnava'. Thereupon Keshab said: 










'Sir, I should not go so far now. People will say that I have become an orthodox Hindu.' 



















"It is extremely difficult to go beyond the three gunas. One cannot reach that state without 










having realized God. Man dwells in the realm of maya. Maya does not permit him to see God. It 










has made him a victim of ignorance. 



















MAN'S INORDINATE ATTACHMENT 



















"Once Hriday brought a bull-calf here. I saw, one day, that he had tied it with a rope in the 










garden, so that it might graze there. I asked him, 'Hriday, why do you tie the calf there every day?' 










'Uncle,' he said, 'I am going to send this calf to our village. When it grows strong I shall yoke it to 










the plough.' As soon as I heard these words I was stunned to think: 'How inscrutable is the play of 










the divine maya! Kamarpukur and Sihore are so far away from Calcutta! This poor calf must go all 










that way. Then it will grow, and at length it will be yoked to the plough. This is indeed the world! 










This is indeed maya!' I fell down unconscious. Only after a long time did I regain consciousness." 



















It was three or four o'clock in the afternoon. M. found Sri Ramakrishna seated on the couch 










in an abstracted mood. After some time he heard him talking to the Divine Mother. The Master 










said, "0 Mother, why hast Thou given him only a particle?" Remaining silent a few moments, he 





































added: "I understand it, Mother. That little bit will be enough for him and will serve Thy purpose. 










That little bit will enable him to teach people." 



















Did the Master thus transmit spiritual powers to his disciples? Did he thus come to know 










that his disciples, after him, would go out into the world as teachers of men? 



















Rakhal was in the room. Sri Ramakrishna was still in a state of partial consciousness when 










he said to Rakhal : "You were angry with me, weren't you? Do you know why I made you angry? 










There was a reason. Only then would the medicine work. The surgeon first brings an abscess to a 










head. Only then does he apply a herb so that it may burst and dry up." 



















After a pause he went on: "Yes, I have found Hazra to be like a piece of dry wood. Then why 










does he live here? This has a meaning too. The play is enlivened by the presence of trouble-makers 










like Jatila and Kutila. 



















(To M.) "One must accept the forms of God. Do you know the meaning of the image of 










Jagaddhatri? She is the Bearer of the Universe. Without her support and protection the universe 










would fall from its place and be destroyed. The Divine Mother, Jagaddhatri, reveals Herself in the 










heart of one who can control the mind, which may be compared to an elephant." 



















RAKHAL: "The mind is a mad elephant." 



















MASTER: "Therefore the lion, the carrier of the Divine Mother, keeps it under control." 



















It was dusk. The evening service began in the temples. Sri Ramakrishna was chanting the 










names of the gods and goddesses. He was seated on the small couch, with folded hands, and 










became absorbed in contemplation of the Divine Mother. The world outside was flooded with 










moonlight, and the devotees inside the Master's room sat in silence and looked at his serene face. 



















In the mean time Govinda of Belgharia and some of his friends had entered the room. Sri 










Ramakrishna was still in a semi-conscious state. After a few minutes he said to the devotees: "Tell 










me your doubts. I shall explain everything." 



















Govinda and the other devotees looked thoughtful. 



















BLACK COMPLEXION OF THE DIVINE MOTHER 



















GOVINDA: "Revered sir, why does the Divine Mother have a black complexion?" 



















MASTER: "You see Her as black because you are far away from Her. Go near and you will 










find Her devoid of all colour. The water of a lake appears black from a distance. Go near and take 










the water in your hand, and you will see that it has no colour at all. Similarly, the sky looks blue 










from a distance. But look at the atmosphere near you; it has no colour. The nearer you come to 










God, the more you will realize that He has neither name nor form. If you move away from the 










Divine Mother, you will find Her blue, like the grass-flower. Is Syama male or female? A man once 










saw the image of the Divine Mother wearing a sacred thread. He said to the worshipper: 'What? 










You have put the sacred thread on the Mother's neck!' The worshipper said: 'Brother, I see that 





































you have truly known the Mother. But I have not yet been able to find out whether She is male or 










female; that is why I have put the sacred thread on Her image.' 



















"That which is Syama is also Brahman. That which has form, again, is without form. That 










which has attributes, again, has no attributes. Brahman is Sakti; Sakti is Brahman. They are not 










two. These are only two aspects, male and female, of the same Reality, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss 










Absolute." 



















GOVINDA: "What is the meaning of 'yogamaya'?" 



















MASTER: "It signifies the yoga, or union, of Purusha and Prakriti. Whatever you perceive in 










the universe is the outcome of this union. Take the image of Siva and Kali. Kali stands on the 










bosom of Siva; Siva lies under Her feet like a corpse; Kali looks at Siva. All this denotes the union of 










Purusha and Prakriti. Purusha is inactive; therefore Siva lies on the ground like a corpse. Prakriti 










performs all Her activities in conjunction with Purusha. Thus She creates, preserves, and destroys. 










That is also the meaning of the conjoined images of Radha and Krishna. On account of that union, 










again, the images are slightly inclined toward each other. 



















"To denote this union, Sri Krishna wears a pearl in His nose, Radha a blue stone in hers. 










Radha has a fair complexion, bright as the pearl. Sri Krishna's is blue. For this reason Radha wears 










the blue stone. Further, Krishna's apparel is yellow, and Radha's blue. 



















"Who is the best devotee of God? It is he who sees, after the realization of Brahman, that 










God alone has become all living beings, the universe, and the twenty-four cosmic principles. One 










must discriminate at first, saying 'Not this, not this', and reach the roof. After that one realizes that 










the steps are made of the same materials as the roof, namely, brick, lime, and brick-dust. The 










devotee realizes that it is Brahman alone that has become all these-the living beings, the universe, 










and so on. 



















"Mere dry reasoning-l spit on it! I have no use for it! (The Master spits on the ground.) 



















"Why should I make myself dry through mere reasoning? May I have unalloyed love for the 










Lotus Feet of God as long as the consciousness of T and 'you' remains with me! 



















(To Govinda) "Sometimes I say, 'Thou art verily I, and I am verily Thou.' Again I feel, 'Thou 










art Thou.' Then I do not find any trace of T. It is Sakti alone that becomes flesh as God Incarnate. 










According to one school of thought, Rama and Krishna are but two waves in the Ocean of Absolute 










Bliss and Consciousness. 



















SEEING GOD IN EVERYTHING 



















"Chaitanya, Consciousness, is awakened after Advaita-jnana, the Knowledge of the non-dual 










Brahman. Then one perceives that God alone exists in all beings as Consciousness. After this 










realization comes Ananda, Bliss. Advaita, Chaitanya, and Nityananda. 



















(To M.) "Let me ask you not to disbelieve in the forms of God. Have faith in God's forms. 










Meditate on that form of God which appeals to your mind. 





































(To Govinda) "The fact is that one does not feel the longing to know or see God as long as 










one wants to enjoy worldly objects. The child forgets everything when he plays with his toys. Try to 










cajole him away from play with a sweetmeat; you will not succeed. He will eat only a bit of it. 










When he relishes neither the sweetmeat nor his play, then he says, 'I want to go to my mother.' He 










doesn't care for the sweetmeat any more. If a man whom he doesn't know and has never seen 










says to the child, 'Come along; I shall take you to your mother', the child follows him. The child will 










go with anyone who will carry him to his mother. 



















The soul becomes restless for God when one is through with the enjoyment of worldly 










things. Then a person has only one thought-how to realize God. He listens to whatever anyone 










says to him about God." 



















M. (to himself): "Alas! The soul becomes restless for God only when one is through with the 










enjoyment of worldly things." 



















August 18, 1883 



















MYSTERY OF DIVINE INCARNATION 



















Sri Ramakrishna was at Balaram Bose's house in Calcutta. He was explaining the mystery of 










Divine Incarnation to the devotees. 



















MASTER: "In order to bring people spiritual knowledge, an Incarnation of God lives in the 










world in the company of devotees, cherishing an attitude of love for God. It is like going up and 










coming down the stairs after having once reached the roof. In order to reach the roof, other 










people should follow the path of devotion, as long as they have not attained Knowledge and 










become free of desire. The roof can be reached only when all desires are done away with. The 










shopkeeper does not go to bed before finishing his accounts. He goes to sleep only when his 










accounts are finished. 



















(To M.) "A man will certainly succeed if he will take the plunge. Success is sure for such a 



















man. 



















"Well, what do you think of the worship conducted by Keshab, Shivanath, and the other 










Brahmo leaders?" 



















M: "They are satisfied, as you say, with describing the garden, but they seldom speak of 










seeing the Master of the garden. Describing the garden is the beginning and end of their worship." 



















MASTER: "You are right. Our only duty is to seek the Master of the garden and speak to 










Him. The only purpose of life is to realize God." 



















Sri Ramakrishna then went to Adhar's house. After dusk he sang and danced in Adhar's 










drawing-room. M., Rakhal , and other devotees were present. After the music he sat down, still in 










an ecstatic mood. He said to Rakhal: "This religious fervour is not like rain in the rainy season, 










which comes in torrents and goes in torrents. It is like an image of Siva that has not been set up by 










human hands but is a natural one that has sprung up, as it were, from the bowels of the earth. The 










other day you left Dakshineswar in a temper. I prayed to the Divine Mother to forgive you." 





































The Master was still in an abstracted mood and said to Adhar, "My son, meditate on the 










Deity whose name you chanted." With these words he touched Adhar's tongue with his finger and 










wrote something on it. Did the Master thereby impart spirituality to Adhar? 



















THE MASTER AND M. 



















August 19, 1883 



















IT WAS SUNDAY, the first day after the full moon. Sri Ramakrishna was resting after his 










noon meal. The midday offering had been made in the temples, and the temple doors were closed. 










In the early afternoon the Master sat up on the small couch in his room. M. prostrated himself 










before him and sat on the floor. The Master was talking to him on the philosophy of Vedanta. 



















HOUSEHOLDERS AND NON-DUALISM 



















MASTER (to M.): "Self-Knowledge is discussed in the Ashtavakra Samhita. The non-dualists 










say, 'Soham', that is, 'I am the Supreme Self.' This is the view of the sannyasis of the Vedantic 










school. But this is not the right attitude for householders, who are conscious of doing everything 










themselves. That being so, how can they declare, 'I am That, the actionless Supreme Self? 










According to the non-dualists the Self is unattached. Good and bad, virtue and vice, and the other 










pairs of opposites, cannot in any way injure the Self, though they undoubtedly afflict those who 










have identified themselves with their bodies. Smoke soils the wall, certainly, but it cannot in any 










way affect Akasa, space. Following the Vedantists of this class, Krishnakishore used to say, 'I am 










Kha', meaning Akasa. Being a great devotee, he could say that with some justification; but it is not 










becoming for others to do so. 



















"But to feel that one is a free soul is very good. By constantly repeating, 'I am free, I am 










free', a man verily becomes free. On the other hand, by constantly repeating, 'I am bound, I am 










bound', he certainly becomes bound to worldliness. The fool who says only, 'I am a sinner, I am a 










sinner', verily drowns himself in worldliness. One should rather say: I have chanted the name of 










God. How can I be a sinner? How can I be bound?' 



















(To M.) "You see, I am very much depressed today. Hriday has written me that he is very ill. 










Why should I feel dejected about it? Is it because of maya or daya?" 



















M. could not find suitable words for a reply, and remained silent. 



















MAYA AND COMPASSION 



















MASTER: "Do you know what maya is? It is attachment to relatives-parents, brother and 










sister, wife and children, nephew and niece. Daya means love for all created beings. Now what is 










this, my feeling about Hriday? Is it maya or daya? But Hriday did so much for me: he served me 










whole-heartedly and nursed me when I was ill. But later he tormented me also. The torment 










became so unbearable that once I was about to commit suicide by jumping into the Ganges from 










the top of the embankment. But he did much to serve me. Now my mind will be at rest if he gets 










some money. But whom shall I ask for it? Who likes to speak about such things to our rich 










visitors?" 





































At two or three o'clock in the afternoon Adhar Sen and Balaram arrived. After saluting Sri 










Ramakrishna, they sat on the floor and asked him if he was well. The Master said, "Yes, I am well 










physically, but a little troubled in mind." He did not refer to Hriday and his troubles. 



















The conversation turned to the Goddess Simhavahini. 



















MASTER: "Yes, I visited the Goddess. She is worshipped by one of the branches of the 










Mallick family of Calcutta. This branch of the family is now in straitened circumstances, and the 










house they live in is dilapidated. The walls and floor are spotted with moss and pigeon-droppings, 










and the cement and plaster are crumbling. But other branches of the Mallick family are well off. 










This branch has no signs of prosperity. (To M.) Well, what does that signify?" 



















M. remained silent. 



















MASTER: "The thing is that everyone must reap the result of his past-karma. One must 










admit the influence of tendencies inherited from past births and the result of the prarabdha 










karma. Nevertheless, in that dilapidated house I saw the face of the Goddess radiating a divine 










light. One must believe in the Divine Presence in the image. 



















"Once I went to Vishnupur. The raja of that place has several fine temples. In one of them 










there is an image of the Divine Mother, called Mrinmayi. There are several lakes near the temple, 










known as the Lalbandh, Krishnabandh, and so on. In the water of one of the lakes I could smell the 










ointments that women use for their hair. How do you explain that? I didn't know at that time 










that the woman devotees offer ointments to the Goddess Mrinmayi while visiting Her temple. 










Near the lake I went into samadhi, though I had not yet seen the image in the temple. In that state 










I saw the divine form from the waist up, rising from the water." 



















In the mean time other devotees had arrived. Someone referred to the political revolution 










and civil war in Kabul. A devotee said that Yakub Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, had been 










deposed. He told the Master that the Amir was a great devotee of God. 



















PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE CHARACTERISTICS OF PHYSICAL LIFE 



















MASTER: "But you must remember that pleasure and pain are the characteristics of the 










embodied state. In Kavi Kankan's Chandi it is written that Kaluvir was sent to prison and a heavy 










stone placed on his chest. Yet Kalu was born as a result of a boon from the Divine Mother of the 










Universe. Thus pleasure and pain are inevitable when the soul accepts a body. Again, take the case 










of Srimanta, who was a great devotee. Though his mother, Khullana, was very much devoted to 










the Divine Mother, there was no end to his troubles. He was almost beheaded. There is also the 










instance of the wood-cutter who was a great lover of the Divine Mother. She appeared before him 










and showed him much grace and love; but he had to continue his profession of wood-cutting and 










earn his livelihood by that arduous work. Again, while Devaki, Krishna's mother, was in prison, she 










had a vision of God Himself endowed with four hands, holding mace, discus, conch-shell, and lotus. 










But with all that she couldn't get out of prison." 



















M: "Why speak only of getting out of prison? This body is the source of all our troubles. 










Devaki should have been freed from the body." 





































LAW OF KARMA 



















MASTER: "The truth is that one must reap the result of the prarabdha karma. The body 










remains as long as the results of past actions do not completely wear away. Once a blind man 










bathed in the Ganges and as a result was freed from his sins. But his blindness remained all the 










same. (All laugh.) It was because of his evil deeds in his past birth that he had to undergo that 










affliction." 



















M: "Yes,sir. The arrow that has already left the bow is beyond our control." 



















MASTER: "However much a bhakta may experience physical joy and sorrow, he always has 










knowledge and the treasure of divine love. This treasure never leaves him. Take the Pandava 










brothers for instance. Though they suffered so many calamities, they did not lose their 










God-Consciousness even once. Where can you find men like them, endowed with so much 










knowledge and devotion?" 



















Just then Narendra and Colonel Viswanath Upadhyaya entered the room. Narendra was 










then twenty-two years old and studying in college. They saluted the Master and sat down. The 










Master requested Narendra to sing. The Tanpura hung on the west wall of the room. The devotees 










fixed their eyes on Narendra as he began to tune the drums. 



















MASTER (to Narendra): "The drums don't sound as well as before." 



















CAPTAIN: "They are now full. Therefore they are quiet, like a vessel filled with water. Or 










they are like a holy man, who remains silent when his heart is full of God-Consciousness." 



















MASTER: "But what about sages like Narada?" 



















CAPTAIN: "They talked because they were moved by the sufferings of others." 



















MASTER: "You are right. After attaining samadhi, Narada, Sukadeva, and others came down 










a few steps, as it were, to the plane of normal consciousness and broke their silence out of 










compassion for the sufferings of others and to help them." 



















Narendra began to sing: 



















Oh, when will dawn for me that day of blessedness When He who is all Good, all Beauty, 










and all Truth, Will light the inmost shrine of my heart? 



















When shall I sink at last, ever beholding Him, Into that Ocean of Delight? . . . 



















No sooner had the Master heard a few words of the song than he went into deep samadhi. 










He sat with folded hands, facing the east. His body was erect and his mind completely bereft of 










worldly consciousness. His breath had almost stopped. With unwinking eyes he sat motionless as a 










picture on a canvas. His mind had dived deep into the Ocean of God's Beauty. 



















Narendra left the room and went to the east verandah, where Hazra was seated on a 










blanket, with a rosary in his hand. They fell to talking. Other devotees arrived. The Master came 










down from samadhi and looked around. He could not find Narendra. The Tanpura was lying on the 










floor. He noticed that the earnest eyes of the devotees were riveted on him. 





































MASTER (referring to Narendra): "He has lighted the fire. Now it doesn't matter whether he 










stays in the room or goes out. 



















JOY OF GOD-CONSCIOUSNESS 



















(To Captain and the other devotees) "Attribute to yourselves the bliss of 










God-Consciousness; then you too will experience ineffable joy. The bliss of God-Consciousness 










always exists in you. It is only hidden by the veiling and projecting power of maya. The less you are 










attached to the world, the more you love God." 



















CAPTAIN: "The farther you proceed toward your home in Calcutta, the farther you leave 










Benares behind. Again, the farther you proceed toward Benares, the farther behind you leave your 










home." 



















MASTER: "As Radha advanced toward Krishna, she could smell more and more of the sweet 










fragrance of His body. The nearer you approach to God, the more you feel His love. As the river 










approaches the ocean it increasingly feels the flow of the tides. 



















IDEALS OF JNANI AND BHAKTA 



















"The Jnani experiences God-Consciousness within himself; it is like the upper Ganges, 










flowing in only one direction. To him the whole universe is illusory, like a dream; he is always 










established in the Reality of Self. But with the lover of God the case is different. His feeling does 










not flow in only one direction. He feels both the ebb-tide and the flood-tide of divine emotion. 










He laughs and weeps and dances and sings in the ecstasy of God. The lover of God likes to sport 










with Him. In the Ocean of God-Consciousness he sometimes swims, sometimes goes down, and 










sometimes rises to the surface-like pieces of ice in the water. (Laughter.) 



















BRAHMAN AND SAKTI ARE NOT DIFFERENT 



















"The Jnani seeks to realize Brahman. But the ideal of the bhakta is the Personal God-a God 










endowed with omnipotence and with the six treasures. Yet Brahman and Sakti are, in fact, not 










different. That which is the Blissful Mother is, again, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. They are 










like the gem and its lustre. When one speaks of the lustre of the gem, one thinks of the gem; and 










again, when one speaks of the gem, one refers to its lustre. One cannot conceive of the lustre of 










the gem without thinking of the gem, and one cannot conceive of the gem without thinking of its 










lustre. 



















"Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute is one, and one only. But It is associated with different 










limiting adjuncts on account of the different degrees of Its manifestation. That is why one finds 










various forms of God. The devotee sings, '0 my Divine Mother, Thou art all these!' Wherever you 










see actions, like creation, preservation, and dissolution, there is the manifestation of Sakti. 










Water is water whether it is calm or full of waves and bubbles. The Absolute alone is the 










Primordial Energy, which creates, preserves, and destroys. Thus it is the same 'Captain', whether 










he remains inactive or performs his worship or pays a visit to the Governor General. Only we 










designate him by different names at different times." 





































CAPTAIN: "Yes, sir, that is so." 





































MASTER: "I said those words to Keshab Sen." 



















CAPTAIN: "Keshab is not an orthodox Hindu. He adopts manners and customs according to 










his own whim. He is a well-to-do gentleman and not a holy man." 



















MASTER (to the other devotees): "Captain forbids me to go to see Keshab." 



















CAPTAIN: "But, sir, you act as you will. What can I do?" 



















MASTER (sharply): "Why shouldn't I go to see Keshab? You feel at ease when you go to the 










Governor General's house, and for money at that. Keshab thinks of God and chants His name. 










Isn't it you who are always saying that God Himself has become the universe and all its living 










beings? Doesn't God dwell in Keshab also?" 



















With these words the Master left the room abruptly and went to the northeast verandah. 










Captain and the other devotees remained, waiting for his return. M. accompanied the Master to 










the verandah, where Narendra was talking with Hazra. Sri Ramakrishna knew that Hazra always 










indulged in dry philosophical discussions. Hazra would say: "The world is unreal, like a dream. 










Worship, food offerings to the Deity, and so forth, are only hallucinations of the mind. The aim of 










spiritual life is to meditate on one's own real Self." Then he would repeat, "I am He." But, with all 










that, he had a soft corner in his heart for money, material things, and people's attention. 



















Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to Hazra and Narendra, "Hello! What are you talking 










about?" 



















NARENDRA (smiling): "Oh, we are discussing a great many things. They are rather too deep 










for others." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "But Pure Knowledge and Pure Love are one and the same thing. 










Both lead the aspirants to the same goal. The path of love is much the easier." 



















Narendra quoted a song: 



















Mother, make me mad with Thy love! What need have I of knowledge or reason? 



















Narendra said to M. that he had been reading a book by Hamilton, who wrote: "A learned 










ignorance is the end of philosophy and the beginning of religion." 



















MASTER (to M.): "What does that mean?" 



















Narendra explained the sentence in Bengali. The Master beamed with joy and said in 










English, "Thank you! Thank you!" Everyone laughed at the charming way he said these words. They 










knew that his English vocabulary consisted of only half a dozen words. 



















It was almost dusk when most of the devotees, including Narendra, took leave of the 










Master. Sri Ramakrishna went out and looked at the Ganges for a few minutes from the west 










porch. Two priests were bathing in preparation for the evening worship. Young men of the village 





































were strolling in the garden or standing on the concrete embankment, gazing at the murmuring 










river. Others, perhaps more thoughtful, were walking about in the solitude of the Panchavati. 



















It became dark. The maidservant lighted the lamp in Sri Ramakrishna's room and burnt 










incense. The evening worship began in the twelve temples of Siva and in the shrines of Krishna and 










Kali. 



















As it was the first day after the full moon, the moonlight soon flooded the tops of the trees 










and temples, and touched with silver the numberless waves of the sacred river. 



















The Master returned to his room. After bowing to the Divine Mother, he clapped his hands 










and chanted the sweet names of God. A number of holy pictures hung on the walls of the room. 










Among others, there were pictures of Dhruva, Prahlada, Kali, Radha-Krishna, and the coronation of 










Rama. The Master bowed low before the pictures and repeated the holy names. Then he repeated 










the holy words, "Brahma-Atma-Bhagavan; Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan; Brahma-Sakti, 










Sakti-Brahma; Veda, Purana, Tantra, Gita, Gayatri." Then he said: "I have taken refuge at Thy feet, 










Divine Mother; not I, but Thou. I am the machine and Thou art the Operator", and so on. 



















MASTER EXTOLS NARENDRA 



















While the Master was meditating in this fashion on the Divine Mother, a few devotees, 










coming in from the garden, gathered in his room. Sri Ramakrishna sat down on the small couch. 










He said to the devotees: "Narendra, Bhavanath, Rakhal , and devotees like them belong to the 










group of the nityasiddhas; they are eternally free. Religious practice on their part is superfluous. 










Look at Narendra. He doesn't care about anyone. One day he was going with me in Captain's 










carriage. Captain wanted him to take a good seat, but Narendra didn't even look at him. He is 










independent even of me. He doesn't tell me all he knows, lest I should praise his scholarship 










before others. He is free from ignorance and delusion. He has no bonds. He is a great soul. He has 










many good qualities. He is expert in music, both as a singer and player, and is also a versatile 










scholar. Again, he keeps his passions under control and says that he will never marry. There is a 










close friendship between Narendra and Bhavanath; they are just like man and woman. Narendra 










doesn't come here very often. That is good, for I am overwhelmed by his presence." 



















Monday, August 20, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed, inside the mosquito net, meditating. It was about 










eight o'clock in the evening. M. was sitting on the floor with his friend Hari Babu. Hari, a young 










man of twenty-eight, had lost his wife about eleven years before and had not married a second 










time. He was much, devoted to his parents, brothers, and sisters. 



















Hazra was living at Dakshineswar. Rakhal lived with the Master, though now and then he 










stayed at Adhar's house. Narendra, Bhavanath, Adhar, M., Ram, Manomohan, and other devotees 










visited the Master almost every week. 



















Hriday, Sri Ramakrishna's nephew, was ill in his home in the country. The Master was 










worried about him. One of the devotees had sent him a little money, but the Master did not know 










it. 





































When Sri Ramakrishna came out of the mosquito net and sat on the small couch, the 










devotees saluted him. 



















MASTER (to M.): "I was meditating inside the net. It occurred to me that meditation, after 










all, was nothing but the imagining of a form, and so I did not enjoy it. One gets satisfaction if God 










reveals Himself in a flash. Again, I said to myself, 'Who is it that meditates, and on whom does he 










meditate?' " 



















M: "Yes, sir. You said that God Himself has become everything-the universe and all living 










beings. Even he who meditates is God." 



















MASTER: "What is more, one cannot meditate unless God wills it. One can meditate when 










God makes it possible for one to do so. What do you say?" 



















M: "True, sir. You feel like that because there is no T in you. When there is no ego, one 










feels like that." 



















MASTER: "But it is good .to have a trace of ego, which makes it possible for a man to feel 










that he is the servant of God. As long as a man thinks that it is he who is doing his duties, it is very 










good for him to feel that God is the Master and he God's servant. When one is conscious of doing 










work, one should establish with God the relationship of servant and Master." 



















M. was always reflecting on the nature of the Supreme Brahman. 



















NATURE OF BRAHMAN 



















MASTER (to M.): "Like the Akasa, Brahman is without any modification. It has become 










manifold because of Sakti. Again, Brahman is like fire, which itself has no colour. The fire appears 










white if you throw a white substance into it, red if you throw a red, black if you throw a black. 










The three gunas-sattva, rajas, and tamas-belong to Sakti alone. Brahman Itself is beyond the three 










gunas. What Brahman is cannot be described. It is beyond words. That which remains after 










everything is eliminated by the Vedantic process of 'Not this, not this', and which is of the nature 










of Bliss, is Brahman. 



















"Suppose the husband of a young girl has come to his father-in-law's house and is seated in 










the drawing-room with other young men of his age. The girl and her friends are looking at them 










through the window. Her friends do not know her husband and ask her, pointing to one young 










man, 'Is that your husband?' 'No', she answers, smiling. They point to another young man and ask 










if he is her husband. Again she answers no. They repeat the question, referring to a third, and she 










gives the same answer. At last they point to her husband and ask, 'Is he the one?' She says neither 










yes nor no, but only smiles and keeps quiet. Her friends realize that he is her husband. 



















"One becomes silent on realizing the true nature of Brahman. 



















(To M.) "Well, why do I talk so much?" 



















M: "You talk in order to awaken the spiritual consciousness of the devotees. You once said 










that when an uncooked luchi is dropped into boiling ghee it makes a sizzling noise." 





































The Master began to talk to M. about Hazra. 



















MASTER: "Do you know the nature of a good man? He never troubles others. He doesn't 










harass people. The nature of some people is such that when they go to a feast they want special 










seats. A man who has true devotion to God never makes a false step, never gives others trouble 










for nothing. 



















"It is not good to live in the company of bad people. A man should stay away from them and 










thus protect himself. (To M.) Isn't that so?" 



















M: "Yes, sir. The mind sinks far down in the company of the wicked. But it is quite 










different with a hero, as you say." 



















M: "When a fire is feeble it goes out when even a small stick is thrown into it; but a blazing 










fire is not affected even if a plantain-tree is thrown into it. The tree itself is burnt to ashes." 



















The Master asked M. about his friend Hari Babu. 



















M: "He has come here to pay you his respects. He lost his wife long ago." 










MASTER (to Hari): "What kind of work do you do?" 



















M: "Nothing in particular. But at home he takes good care of his parents and his brothers 










and sisters." 



















MASTER: "How is that?" 



















MASTER (with a smile): "How is that? You are like 'Elder, the pumpkin-cutter'. You are 










neither a man of the world nor a devotee of God. That is not good. You must have seen the sort of 










elderly man who lives in a family and is always ready, day or night, to entertain the children. He 










sits in the parlour and smokes the hubble-bubble. With nothing in particular to do, he leads a lazy 










life. Now and again he goes to the inner court and cuts a pumpkin; for, since women do not cut 










pumpkins, they send the children to ask him to come and do it. That is the extent of his 










usefulness-hence his nickname, 'Elder, the pumpkin-cutter'. 



















"You must do 'this' as well as 'that'. Do your duties in the world, and also fix your mind on 










the Lotus Feet of the Lord. Read books of devotion like the Bhagavata or the life of Chaitanya when 










you are alone and have nothing else to do." 



















It was about ten o'clock. Sri Ramakrishna finished a light supper of farina pudding and one 










or two luchis. After saluting him, M. and his friend took their leave. 



















Friday, September 7, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking in the Master's room at half past seven in the evening. 










No one else was present. 



















MASTER: "The other day I went to Calcutta. As I drove along the streets in the carriage, I 










observed that everyone's attention was fixed on low things. Everyone was brooding over his 





































stomach and running after nothing but food. Everyone's mind was turned to 'woman and gold'. I 










saw only one or two with their attention fixed on higher things, with their minds turned to God." 



















"The present age has aggravated this stomach-worry. Trying to imitate the English, people 










have turned their attention to more luxuries; therefore their wants have also increased." 



















"They believe in a formless God." 



















MASTER: "What do the English think about God?" 



















MASTER: "That is also one of our beliefs." 



















MASTER'S DEEP SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES 



















For a time Master and disciple remained silent. Then Sri Ramakrishna began to describe his 










experiences of Brahman. 



















MASTER: "One day I had the vision of Consciousness, non-dual and indivisible. At first it had 










been revealed to me that there were innumerable men, animals, and other creatures. Among 










them there were aristocrats, the English, the Mussalmans, myself, scavengers, dogs, and also a 










bearded Mussalman with an earthenware tray of rice in his hand. He put a few grains of rice into 










everybody's mouth. I too tasted a little. 



















"Another day I saw rice, vegetables, and other food-stuff, and filth and dirt as well, lying 










around. Suddenly the soul came out of my body and, like a flame, touched everything. It was like a 










protruding tongue of fire and tasted everything once, even the excreta. It was revealed to me that 










all these are one Substance, the non-dual and indivisible Consciousness. 



















"Another day it was revealed to me that I had devotees-my intimate companions, my very 










own. Thereafter I would climb to the roof of the kuthi as soon as the bells and the conch-shells of 










the evening service sounded in the temples, and cry out with a longing heart: 'Oh, where are you 










all? Come here! I am dying to see you!' 



















(To M.) "Well, what do you think of these visions?" 



















M: "God sports through you. This I have realized, that you are the instrument and God is the 










Master. God has created other beings as if with a machine, but yourself with His own hands." 



















MASTER: "Well, Hazra says that after the vision of God one acquires the six divine powers." 










M: "Those who seek pure love don't want powers." 



















MASTER: "Perhaps Hazra was a poor man in his previous life, and that is why he wants so 










much to see the manifestation of power. He wants to know what I talk about with the cook. He 










says to me: 'You don't have to talk to the cook. I shall talk to the manager of the temple myself and 










see that you get everything you want.' (M. laughs aloud.) He talks to me that way and I say 










nothing." 





































M: "Many a time you have said that a devotee, who loves God for the sake of love does not 










care to see God's powers. A true devotee wants to see God as Gopala. In the beginning God 










becomes the magnet, and the devotee the needle. But in the end the devotee himself becomes 










the magnet, and God the needle; that is to say, God becomes small to His devotee." 



















MASTER: "Yes, it is just like the sun at dawn. You can easily look at that sun. It doesn't 










dazzle the eyes; rather it satisfies them. God becomes tender for the sake of His devotees. He 










appears before them, setting aside His powers." 



















Both remained silent for some time. 



















M: "Why should your visions not be real? If they are unreal, then the world is still more 










unreal; for there is only one mind that is the instrument of perception. Your pure mind sees those 










visions, and our ordinary minds see worldly objects." 



















MASTER: "I see that you have grasped the idea of unreality. Well, tell me what you think of 










Hazra." 



















M: "Oh, I don't know." (The Master laughs.) MASTER: "Well, do you find me to be like 










anybody else?" 



















M: "No, sir." MASTER: "Like any other paramahamsa?" 



















M: "No, sir. You can't be compared to anybody else." MASTER (smiling): "Have you heard of 










a tree called the 'achina'?" 



















M: "No, sir." MASTER: "There is a tree called by that name. But nobody knows what it is." 



















M: "Likewise, it is not possible to recognize you. The more a man understands you, the 










more uplifted he will be." 



















M. was silent. He said to himself: "The Master referred to 'the sun at dawn' and 'the tree 










unrecognizable by man'. Did he mean an Incarnation of God? Is this the play of God through man? 










Is the Master himself an Incarnation? Was this why he cried to the devotees from the roof of the 










kuthi: 'Where are you? Come to me!'?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of the southeast verandah of the Kali temple. 










Rakhal, M., and Hazra were with him. He talked light-heartedly about his boyhood days. 



















When it was dusk he returned to his room and sat down on the small couch. Soon he went 










into samadhi and in that state began to talk to the Divine Mother. He said: "Mother, what is all this 










row about? Shall I go there? I shall go if You take me." The Master was to go to a devotee's house. 










Was it for this that he was asking the Divine Mother's permission? 



















Again he spoke to Her, perhaps praying about an intimate disciple: 



















"Mother, please make him stainless. Well, Mother, why have You given him only a 










particle?" Remaining silent a moment, he said: "Oh, I see. That will be enough for Your work." 





































NATURE OF THE DIVINE INCARNATION 



















In the same state he said, addressing the devotees: "That which is Brahman is verily Sakti. I 










address That, again, as the Mother. I call It Brahman when It is inactive, and Sakti when It creates, 










preserves, and destroys. It is like water, sometimes still and sometimes covered with waves. The 










Incarnation of God is a part of the lila of Sakti. The purpose of the Divine Incarnation is to teach 










man ecstatic love for God. The Incarnation is like the udder of the cow, the only place milk is to be 










got. God incarnates Himself as man. There is a great accumulation of divinity in an Incarnation, like 










the accumulation offish in a deep hollow in a lake." 



















Some of the devotees wondered, "Is Sri Ramakrishna an Incarnation of God, like Krishna, 










Chaitanya, and Christ?" 



















Sunday, September 9, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna had finished his midday meal and was sitting on the small couch. Rakhal , 










M., and Ratan were sitting on the floor. Ratan was the steward of Jadu Mallick's garden house and 










was devoted to the Master. Now and then Ram Chatterji and Hazra passed in or out of the room. 










It was about two o'clock. 



















Ratan told the Master that a yatra performance by Nilkantha had been arranged in Jadu 










Mallick's house in Calcutta. 



















RATAN (to the Master): "You must go. The date has been set." 



















MASTER: "That's good, I want to go. Nilkantha sings with great devotion." 



















A DEVOTEE: "That is true, sir." 



















MASTER: "Tears flow from his eyes as he sings. (To Ratan) I am thinking of spending the 










night in Calcutta when I go to see the yatra." 



















RATAN: "That will be fine." 



















Ram Chatterji and the other devotees asked Ratan about a theft in Jadu Mallick's house. 



















RATAN: "Yes, the golden sandals of the Deity were stolen from the shrine room in Jadu 










Babu's house. It has created an uproar. They are going to try to discover the thief by means of a 










'charmed plate'. Everybody will sit in one room, and the plate will move in the direction of the man 










who stole the sandals." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "How does the plate move? By itself?" 



















RATAN: "No. A man presses it to the ground." 



















A DEVOTEE: "It is a kind of sleight of hand. It is a clever trick." 



















MASTER: "The real cleverness is the cleverness by which one realizes God. That trick is the 










best of all tricks." 





































As the conversation went on, several Bengali gentlemen entered the room and, after 










saluting the Master, sat down. One of them was already known to Sri Ramakrishna. These 










gentlemen followed the cult of Tantra. The Master knew that one of them indulged in immoral 










acts in the name of religion. The Tantra rituals, under certain conditions, allow the mixing of men 










and women devotees. But Sri Ramakrishna regarded all women, even prostitutes, as 










manifestations of the Divine Mother. He addressed them all as "Mother". 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Where is Achalananda? My ideal is different from that of 










Achalananda and his disciples. As for myself, I look on all women as my mother." 



















The visiting gentlemen sat silent. 



















MASTER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD WOMEN 



















MASTER: "Every woman is a mother to me. Achalananda used to stay here now and then. 










He would drink a great deal of consecrated wine. Hearing about my attitude toward women, he 










stubbornly justified his own views. He insisted again and again: 'Why should you not recognize the 










attitude of a "hero" toward women? Won't you admit the injunctions of Siva? Siva Himself is the 










author of the Tantra, which prescribes various disciplines, including the "heroic".' I said to him: 










'But, my dear sir, I don't know. I don't like these ideas. To me every woman is a mother.' 



















"Achalananda did not support his own children. He said to me, 'God will support them.' I 










said nothing. But this is the way I felt about it: 'Who will support your children? I hope your 










renunciation of wife and children is not a way of earning money. People will think you are a holy 










man because you have renounced everything: so they will give you money. In that way you will 










earn plenty of money.' 



















"Spiritual practice with a view to winning a lawsuit and earning money, or to helping others 










win in court and acquire property, shows a very mean understanding. 



















GOOD USE OF MONEY 



















"Money enables a man to get food and drink, build a house, worship the Deity, serve 










devotees and holy men, and help the poor when he happens to meet them. These are the good 










uses of money. Money is not meant for luxuries or creature comforts or for buying a position in 










society. 



















"People practise various Tantrik disciplines to acquire supernatural powers. How mean such 










people are! Krishna said to Arjuna, 'Friend, by acquiring one of the eight siddhis you may add a 










little to your power, but you will not be able to realize Me.' One cannot get rid of maya as long as 










one exercises supernatural powers. And maya begets egotism. 



















"Body and wealth are impermanent. Why go to so much trouble for their sakes? Just think 










of the plight of the hathayogis. Their attention is fixed on one ideal only-longevity. They do not aim 










at the realization of God at all. They practise such exercises as washing out the intestines, drinking 










milk through a tube, and the like, with that one aim in view. 





































"There was once a goldsmith whose tongue suddenly turned up and stuck to his palate. He 










looked like a man in samadhi. He became completely inert and remained so a long time. People 










came to worship him. After several years, his tongue suddenly returned to its natural position, and 










he became conscious of things as before. So he went back to his work as a goldsmith. (All laugh.) 



















"These are physical things and have nothing to do with God. There was a man who knew 










eighty-two postures and talked big about yoga-samadhi. But inwardly he was drawn to 'woman 










and gold'. Once he found a bank-note worth several thousand rupees. He could not resist the 










temptation, and swallowed it, thinking he would get it out somehow later on. The note was got 










out of him all right, but he was sent to jail for three years. In my guilelessness I used to think that 










the man had made great spiritual progress. Really, I say it upon my word! 



















MASTER'S RENUNCIATION OF MONEY 



















"Mahendra Pal of Sinthi once gave Ramlal five rupees. Ramlal told me about it after he had 










gone. I asked him what the gift was for, and Ramlal said that it was meant for me. I thought it 










might enable me to payoff some of my debt for milk. That night I went to bed and, if you will 










believe me, I suddenly woke up with a pain. I felt as if a cat were scratching inside my chest. I at 










once went to Ramlal and asked him: 'For whom did Mahendra give this money? Was it for your 










aunt?7 'No,' said Ramlal, 'it is meant for you.' I said to him, 'Go and return the money at once, or I 










shall have no peace of mind.' Ramlal returned the money early in the morning and I felt relieved. 



















"Once a rich man came here and said to me: 'Sir, you must do something so that I may win 










my lawsuit. I have heard of your reputation and so I have come here.' 'My dear sir,' I said to him, 










'you have made a mistake. I am not the person you are looking for; Achalananda is your man.' 



















"A true devotee of God does not care for such things as wealth or health. He thinks: 'Why 










should I practise spiritual austerities for creature comforts, money, or name and fame? These are 










all impermanent. They last only a day or two.' " 



















The visiting gentlemen took leave of the Master after saluting him. When they had 










departed, Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said to M., "You can never make a thief listen to religion. 










(All laugh.) 



















"Well, what do you think of Narendra?" 



















M: "He is splendid." 



















MASTER: "Yes. His intelligence is as great as his learning. Besides, he is gifted in music, both 










as a singer and player. Then too, he has control over his passions. He says he will never marry." 



















M: "You once said that one who constantly talks of his sin really becomes a sinner; he 










cannot extricate himself from sin. But if a man has firm faith that he is the son of God, then he 










makes rapid strides in spiritual life." 



















MASTER: "Yes, faith. What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say: 'I have 










spoken the name of God once. That is enough. How can I remain a sinner? I have become pure and 










stainless.' One day Haladhari said: 'Even Ajamila had to perform austerities to gratify God. Can one 





































receive the grace of God without austerities? What will one gain by speaking the name of 










Narayana only once?' At these remarks Krishnakishore's anger knew no bounds. The next time he 










came to this garden to pick flowers he wouldn't even look at Haladhari. 



















"Haladhari's father was a great devotee. At bathing-time he would stand waist-deep in the 










water and meditate on God, uttering the sacred mantra; then the tears would flow from his eyes. 



















KRISHNAKISHORE'S FAITH IN GOD 



















"One day a holy man came to the bathing-place on the Ganges at Ariadaha. We talked 










about seeing him. Haladhari said, 'What shall we gain by seeing the body of a man, a mere cage 










made of the five elements?' Krishnakishore heard about it and said: 'What? Did Haladhari ask what 










would be gained by visiting a holy man? By repeating the name of Krishna or Rama a man 










transforms his physical body into a spiritual body. To such a man everything is the embodiment of 










Spirit. To him Krishna is the embodiment of Spirit, and His sacred Abode is the embodiment of 










Spirit.' He also said, 'A man who utters the name of Krishna or Rama even once reaps the result of 










a hundred sandhyas.' 



















"One of his sons chanted the name of Rama on his death-bed. Krishnakishore said, 'He has 










nothing to worry about; he has chanted the name of Rama.' But now and then he wept. After all, it 










was the death of his own son. 



















Nothing whatsoever is achieved by the performance of worship, japa, and devotions, 










without faith. Isn't that so?" 



















M: "Yes, sir. That is true." 



















MASTER: "I see people coming to the Ganges to bathe. They talk their heads off about 










everything under the sun. The widowed aunt says: 'Without me they cannot perform the Durga 










Puja. I have to look after even the smallest detail. Again, I have to supervise everything when there 










is a marriage festival in the family, even the bed of the bride and groom.'" 



















M: "Why should we blame them? How else will they pass the time?" 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Some people have their shrine rooms in their attics. The women 










arrange the offerings and flowers and make the sandal-paste. But, while doing so, they never say a 










word about God. The burden of the conversation is: 'What shall we cook today? I couldn't get good 










vegetables in the market. That curry was delicious yesterday. That boy is my cousin. Hello there! 










Have you that job still? Don't ask me how I am. My Hari is no more.' Just fancy! They talk of such 










things in the shrine room at the time of worship!" 



















M: "Yes, sir, it is so in the majority of cases. As you say, can one who has passionate 










yearning for God continue formal worship and devotions for long?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna and M. were now conversing alone. 



















M: "Sir, if it is God Himself who has become everything, then why do people have so many 










different feelings?" 





































MASTER: "Undoubtedly God exists in all beings as the All-pervading Spirit, but the 










manifestations of His Power are different in different beings. In some places there is a 










manifestation of the power of Knowledge; in others, of the power of ignorance. In some places 










there is a greater manifestation of power than in others. Don't you see that among human beings 










there are cheats and gamblers, to say nothing of men who are like tigers. I think of them as the 










'cheat God 1 , the 'tiger God'." 



















M. (with a smile): "We should salute them from a distance. If we go near the 'tiger God' and 










embrace him, he may devour us." 



















MASTER: "He and His Power, Brahman and Its Power-nothing else exists but this. In a hymn 










to Rama, Narada said: '0 Rama, You are Siva, and Sita is Bhagavati; You are Brahma, and Sita is 










Brahmani; You are Indra, and Sita is Indrani; You are Narayana, and Sita is Lakshmi. Rama, You 










are the symbol of all that is masculine, and Sita of all that is feminine.' " 



















M: "Sir, what is the Spirit-form of God like?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna reflected a moment and said softly: "Shall I tell you what it is like? It is like 










water. . . . One understands all this through spiritual discipline. 



















"Believe in the form of God. It is only after attaining Brahmajnana that one sees 










non-duality, the oneness of Brahman and Its Sakti. Brahman and Sakti are identical, like fire and its 










power to burn. When a man thinks of fire, he must also think of its power to burn. Again, when he 










thinks of the power to burn, he must also think of fire. Further, Brahman and Sakti are like milk 










and its whiteness, water and its wetness. 



















VIJNANA OR TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE 



















"But there is a stage beyond even Brahmajnana. After jnana comes vijnana. He who is 










aware of knowledge is also aware of ignorance. The sage Vasishtha was stricken with grief at the 










death of his hundred sons. Asked by Lakshmana why a man of knowledge should grieve for such a 










reason, Rama said, 'Brother, go beyond both knowledge and ignorance.' He who has knowledge 










has ignorance also. If a thorn has entered your foot, get another thorn and with its help take out 










the first; then throwaway the second also." 



















M: "Should one throwaway both knowledge and ignorance?" 



















MASTER: "Yes. That is why one should acquire vijnana. You see, he who is aware of light is 










also aware of darkness. He who is aware of happiness is also aware of suffering. He who is aware 










of virtue is also aware of vice. He who is aware of good is also aware of evil. He who is aware of 










holiness is also aware of unholiness. He who is aware of T is also aware of 'you'. 



















"What is vijnana? It is knowing God in a special way. The awareness and conviction that fire 










exists in wood is jnana, knowledge. But to cook rice on that fire, eat the rice, and get nourishment 










from it is vijnana. To know by one's inner experience that God exists is jnana. But to talk to Him, to 










enjoy Him as Child, as Friend, as Master, as Beloved, is vijnana. The realization that God alone has 










become the universe and all living beings is vijnana. 





































"According to one school of thought, God cannot be seen. Who sees whom? Is God outside 










you, that you can see Him? One sees only oneself. Having once entered the 'black waters' of the 










ocean, the ship does not come back and so cannot describe what it experiences." 



















M: "It is true, sir. As you say, having climbed to the top of the monument, one becomes 










unaware of what is below: horses and carriages, men and women, houses, shops and offices, and 










so on." 



















MASTER: "I don't go to the Kali temple nowadays. Is that an offence? At one time Narendra 










used to say, 'What? He still goes to the Kali temple!' " 



















M: "Every day you are in a new state of mind. How can you ever offend God?" 



















MASTER: "Someone said to Sen, about Hriday: 'He is very ill. Please bring two pieces of cloth 










and a couple of shirts for him. We will send them to his village.' Sen offered only two rupees. How 










do you explain that? He has so much money, and yet he is so miserly! What do you say to that?" 



















M: "Those who seek God cannot behave that way-l mean those whose goal is the 










attainment of Knowledge." 



















MASTER: "God alone is the Reality and all else is unreal." 



















Saturday, September 22, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna was seated in the drawing-room of Adhar's house in Calcutta, with Rakhal , 










Adhar, M., Ishan, and other devotees. Many gentlemen of the neighbourhood were also present. 










It was afternoon. 



















The Master was very fond of Ishan. He had been a superintendent in the Accountant 










General's office, and later on his children also occupied high government positions. One of them 










was a class-mate of Narendra. Ishan's purse was always open for the poor and needy. When he 










retired from service, he devoted his time to spiritual practices and charity. He often visited Sri 










Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar. 



















MASTER (to Ishan): "Please tell us the story of the boy who posted the letter." 



















ISHAN (with a smile): "A boy once heard that God is our Creator. So he wrote a letter to 










God, setting forth his prayers, and posted it. The address he put on the envelope was 'Heaven'." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Did you hear that story? One succeeds in spiritual life when one 










develops a faith like that boy's. (To Ishan) Tell us about the renunciation of activities." 



















ISHAN: "After the attainment of God, religious duties such as the sandyha drop away. One 










day some people were sitting on the bank of the Ganges performing the sandyha. But one of them 










abstained from it. On being asked the reason, he said: 'I am observing asoucha. I cannot perform 










the sandyha ceremony. In my case the defilement is due to both a birth and a death. My mother, 










Ignorance, is dead, and my son, Self-Knowledge, has been born.'" 



















MASTER: "Tell us, also, how caste distinctions drop away when one attains Self-Knowledge." 





































ISHAN: "Sankaracharya was once climbing the steps after finishing his bath in the Ganges, 










when he saw just in front of him an untouchable who had a pack of dogs with him. 'You have 










touched me!' said Sankara. 'Revered sir,' said the pariah, 'I have not touched you, nor have you 










touched me. The Self is the Inner Ruler of all beings and cannot be contaminated. Is there any 










difference between the sun's reflection in wine and its reflection in the Ganges?' " 



















MASTER (with a smile): "And about harmony: how one can realize God through all paths." 



















Ishan (smiling): "Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference is only 










in the pratyaya. In reality, He who is Hari is also Hara. If a man has faith in God, then it doesn't 










matter whom he worships." 



















MASTER: "And please tell us also how the heart of the sadhu is the greatest of all." 



















ISHAN: "This earth is the largest thing we see anywhere around us. But larger than the earth 










is the ocean, and larger than the ocean is the sky. But Vishnu, the Godhead, has covered earth, sky, 










and the nether world with one of His feet. And that foot of Vishnu is enshrined in the sadhu's 










heart. Therefore the heart of a holy man is the greatest of all." 



















The devotees were delighted with Ishan's words. 



















Ishan intended to retire to a solitary place and practise a special discipline of the Gayatri, 










through which Brahman is invoked. But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not 










possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was impossible 










for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life 










was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic 










worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Sakti, the Divine Mother, who is identical with 










Brahman. 



















MASTER (to Ishan): "Why do you waste your time simply repeating 'Neti, neti'? Nothing 










whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that It exists. 



















"Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial Energy, 










the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation, and destruction, living beings and the universe, 










and further, meditation and the meditator, bhakti and prema-all these are manifestations of the 










glory of that Power. 



















"But Brahman is identical with Its Power. On returning from Ceylon, Hanuman praised 










Rama, saying: '0 Rama, You are the Supreme Brahman, and Sita is Your Sakti. You and She are 










identical' Brahman and Sakti are like the snake and. its wriggling motion. Thinking of the snake, 










one must think of its wriggling motion, and thinking of its wriggling motion, one must think of the 










snake. Or they are like milk and its whiteness. Thinking of milk, one has to think of its colour, that 










is, whiteness, and thinking of the whiteness of milk, one has to think of milk itself. Or they are like 










water and its wetness. Thinking of water, one has to think of its wetness, and thinking of the 










wetness of water, one has to think of water. 



















"This Primal Power, Mahamaya, has covered Brahman. As soon as the covering is 










withdrawn, one realizes: 'I am what I was before', 'I am Thou; Thou art I'. 





































"As long as that covering remains, the Vedantic formula 'I am He', that is, man is the 










Supreme Brahman, does not rightly apply. The wave is part of the water, but the water is not part 










of the wave. As long as that covering remains, one should call on God as Mother. Addressing God, 










the devotee should say, 'Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child; Thou art the Master and I am Thy 










servant.' It is good to have the attitude of the servant toward the master. From this relationship of 










master and servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of 










friend toward friend, and so forth. When the master loves his servant, he may say to him, 'Come, 










sit by my side; there is no difference between you and me.' But if the servant comes forward of his 










own will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry? 



















"God's play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the glory of the ChitSakti, the 










Divine Power. That which is Brahman is also Rama, Krishna, and Siva." 



















ISHAN: "Yes, sir. Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference lies only 










in the pratyaya." 



















MASTER: "Yes, there is only One without a second. The Vedas speak of It as 'Om 










Satchidananda Brahma', the Puranas as 'Om Satchidananda Krishna,' and the Tantra as 'Om 










Satchidananda Siva'. 



















"The ChitSakti, as Mahamaya, has deluded all with ignorance. It is said in the Adhyatma 










Ramayana that when the rishis saw Rama, they prayed to Him in these words only: '0 Rama, 










please do not delude us with Your world-bewitching maya.' " 



















ISHAN: "What is this maya?" 



















MASTER: "Whatever you see, think, or hear is maya. In a word, 'woman and gold' is the 










covering of maya. 



















"There is no harm in chewing betel-leaf, eating fish, smoking, or rubbing the body with oil. 










What will one achieve by renouncing only these things? The one thing needful is the renunciation 










of 'woman and gold'. That renunciation is the real and supreme renunciation. Householders should 










go into solitude now and then, to practise spiritual discipline in order to cultivate devotion to God; 










they should renounce mentally. But the sannyasi should renounce both mentally and physically. 



















"I once said to Keshab, 'How can a typhoid patient be cured if he remains in a room where a 










pitcher of water and a jar of pickles are kept?' Now and then one should live in solitude ". 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, what do you think of the Navavidhan? It seems to me like a hotchpotch of 










everything." 



















MASTER: "Some say it is a modern thing. That sets me wondering: 'Then is the God of the 










Brahmo Samaj a new God?' The Brahmos speak of their cult as the Navavidhan, as a New 










Dispensation. Well, it may be so. Who knows? There are six systems of philosophy; so perhaps it is 










like one of these. 



















"But do you know where those who speak of the formless God make their mistake? It is 










where they say that God is formless only, and that those who differ with them are wrong. 





































"But I know that God is both with and without form. And He may have many more aspects. 










It is possible for Him to be everything. 



















(To Ishan) "The ChitSakti, Mahamaya, has become the twenty-four cosmic principles. One 










day as I was meditating, my mind wandered away to Rashke's house. He is a scavenger. I said to 










my mind, 'Stay there, you rogue!' The Divine Mother revealed to me that the men and women in 










this house were mere masks; inside them was the same Divine Power, Kundalini, that rises up 










through the six spiritual centres of the body. 



















"Is the Primal Energy man or woman? Once at Kamarpukur I saw the worship of Kali in the 










house of the Lahas. They put a sacred thread on the image of the Divine Mother. One man asked, 










'Why have they put the sacred thread on the Mother's person?' The master of the house said: 










'Brother, I see that you have rightly understood the Mother. But I do not yet know whether the 










Divine Mother is male or female.' 



















"It is said that Mahamaya swallowed Siva. When the six centres in Her were awakened, Siva 










came out through Her thigh. Then Siva created the Tantra philosophy. 



















"Take refuge in the ChitSakti, the Mahamaya." 



















ISHAN: "Please bestow your grace on me." 



















MASTER: "Say to God with a guileless heart, '0 God, reveal Thyself to me.' And weep. Pray 










to God, '0 God, keep my mind away from "woman, and gold".' And dive deep. Can a man get 










pearls by floating or swimming on the surface? He must dive deep. 



















FAITH IN THE GURU 



















"One must get instruction from a guru. Once a man was looking for a stone image of Siva. 










Someone said to him: 'Go to a certain river. There you will find a tree. Near it is a whirlpool. Dive 










into the water there, and you will find the image of Siva.' So I say that one must get instruction 










from a teacher." 



















ISHAN: "That is true, sir." 



















MASTER: "It is Satchidananda that comes to us in the form of the guru. If a man is initiated 










by a human guru, he will not achieve anything if he regards his guru as a mere man. The guru 










should be regarded as the direct manifestation of God. Only then can the disciple have faith in 










the mantra given by the guru. Once a man has faith he, achieves all. The sudra Ekalavya learnt 










archery in the forest before a clay image of Drona; He worshipped the image as the living Drona; 










that by itself enabled him to attain mastery in archery. 



















"Don't mix intimately with brahmin pundits. Their only concern is to earn money. I have 










seen brahmin priests reciting the Chandi while performing the swastyayana. It is hard to tell 










whether they are reading the sacred book or something else. They turn half the pages without 










reading them. (All laugh.) 





































"A nail-knife suffices to kill oneself. One needs sword and shield to kill others. That is the 










purpose of the sastras. 



















"One doesn't really need to study the different scriptures. If one has no discrimination, one 










doesn't achieve anything through mere scholarship, even though one studies all the six systems of 










philosophy. Call on God, crying to Him secretly in solitude. He will give all that you need." 



















Sri Ramakrishna had heard that Ishan was building a house on the bank of the Ganges for 










the practice of spiritual discipline. He asked Ishan eagerly: "Has the house been built? Let me tell 










you that the less people know of your spiritual life, the better it will be for you. Devotees endowed 










with sattva meditate in a secluded corner or in a forest, or withdraw into the mind. Sometimes 










they meditate inside the mosquito net." 



















Now and then Ishan invited Hazra to his house. Hazra had a craze for outward purity. Sri 










Ramakrishna often discouraged him in this. 



















MASTER (to Ishan): "Let me tell you another thing. Don't be over-fastidious about outward 










purity. Once a sadhu felt very thirsty. A water-carrier was carrying water in his skin water-bag, and 










offered the water to the holy man. The sadhu asked if the skin was clean. The carrier said: 










'Revered sir; my skin bag is perfectly clean. But inside your skin are all sorts of filthy things. That 










is why I can ask you to drink water from my skin. It won't injure you.' By 'your skin', the carrier 










meant the body, the belly, and so forth. 



















"Have faith in the name of God. Then you won't need even to go to holy places." Sri 










Ramakrishna sang, intoxicated with divine fervour: 



















Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas, 



















So long as I can breathe my last with Kali's name upon my lips? 



















Ishan remained silent. 



















MASTER (to Ishan): "Tell me if you have any more doubts." 










ISHAN: "You said everything when you spoke of faith." 



















MASTER: "God can be realized by true faith alone. And the realization is hastened if you 










believe everything about God. The cow that picks and chooses its food gives milk only in dribblets, 










but if she eats all kinds of plants, then her milk flows in torrents. 



















"Once I heard a story. A man heard the command of God that he should see his Ideal Deity 










in a ram. He at once believed it. It is God who exists in all beings. 



















"A guru said to his disciple, 'It is Rama alone who resides in all bodies.' The disciple was a 










man of great faith. One day a dog snatched a piece of bread from him and started to run away. He 










ran after the dog, with a jar of butter in his hand, and cried again and again: '0 Rama, stand still a 










minute. That bread hasn't been buttered.' 





































"What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say, 'By chanting "Om Krishna, Om 










Rama", one gets the result of a million sandhyas.' Once he said to me secretly, 'I don't like the 










sandhya and other devotions any more; but don't tell anyone.' 



















"Sometimes I too feel that way. The Mother reveals to me that She Herself has become 










everything. One day I was coming from the pine-grove toward the Panchavati. A dog followed me. 










I stood still for a while near the Panchavati. The thought came to my mind that the Mother might 










say something to me through that dog. 



















"You were absolutely right when you said that through faith alone one achieves all." 



















ISHAN: "But we are householders." 



















MASTER: "What if you are? Through His grace even the impossible becomes possible. 










Ramprasad sang, 'This world is a mere framework of illusion.' Another man composed a song by 










way of reply: 



















This very world is a mansion of mirth; Here I can eat, here drink and make merry. Janaka's 










might was unsurpassed; What did he lack of the world or the Spirit? Holding to one as well as the 










other, He drank his milk from a brimming cup! 



















"One should first realize God through spiritual discipline in solitude, and then live in the 










world. Only then can one be a King Janaka. What can you achieve otherwise? 



















"Further, take the case of Siva. He has everything-Kartika, Ganesa, Lakshmi, and Sarasvati. 










Still, sometimes He dances in a state of divine fervour, chanting the name of Rama, and sometimes 










He is absorbed in samadhi." 



















INSTRUCTION TO VAISHNAVAS AND BRAHMOS 



















Sunday, September 23, 1883 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar with Rakhal , M., and other 










devotees. Hazra sat on the porch outside. The Master was conversing with the devotees. 



















MASTER (to a devotee): "Narendra doesn't like even you, nowadays. (To M.) Why didn't he 










come to see me at Adhar's house? 



















EULOGY OF NARENDRA 



















"How versatile Narendra is! He is gifted in singing, in playing on instruments, and in studies. 










He is independent and doesn't care about anybody. The other day he was returning to Calcutta 










with Captain in his carriage. Captain begged Narendra to sit beside him, but he took a seat 










opposite. He didn't even look at Captain. 



















"What can a man achieve through mere scholarship? What is needed is prayer and spiritual 










discipline. Gauri of Indesh was both a scholar and a devotee. He was a worshipper of the Divine 










Mother. Now and then he would be overpowered with spiritual fervour. When he chanted a hymn 





































to the Mother, the pundits would seem like earthworms beside him. I too would be overcome with 










ecstasy. 



















"At first he was a bigoted worshipper of Sakti. He used to pick up tulsi leaves with a couple 










of sticks, so as not to touch them with his fingers. (All laugh.) Then he went home. When he came 










back he didn't behave that way any more. He gave remarkable interpretations of Hindu 










mythology. He would say that the ten heads of Ravana represented the ten organs. Kumbhakarna 










was the symbol, of tamas, Ravana of rajas, and Bibhishana of sattva. That was why Bibhishana 










obtained favour with Rama." 



















After the Master's midday meal, while he was resting, Ram, Tarak, and some other 










devotees arrived from Calcutta. 



















Nityagopal, Tarak, and several others were staying with Ram, a house-holder disciple of the 










Master. Nityagopal was always in an exalted spiritual mood. Tarak's mind, too, was always 










indrawn; he seldom exchanged words with others. Ram looked after their physical needs. Rakhal 










now and then spent a few days at Adhar's house. 



















RAM (to the Master): "We have been taking lessons on the drum." 



















MASTER (to Ram): "Nityagopal too?" 



















RAM: "No, sir. He plays a little." 



















MASTER: "And Tarak?" 



















RAM: "He knows a good deal." 



















MASTER: "Then he won't keep his eyes on the ground so much. If the mind is much directed 










to something else, it doesn't dwell deeply on God." 



















RAM: "I have been studying the drum only to accompany the kirtan." 



















MASTER (to M.): "I hear that you too are taking singing lessons. Is that so?" 



















M: "No, sir. I just open my mouth now and then." 



















MASTER: "Have you practised that song: '0 Mother, make me mad with Thy love'? If you 










have, please sing it. The song expresses my ideal perfectly." 



















The conversation turned to Hazra's hatred for certain people, which Sri Ramakrishna did not 



















like. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "I used frequently to visit a certain house at Kamarpukur. The 










boys of the family were of my age. The other day they came here and spent two or three days with 










me. Their mother, like Hazra, used to hate people. Then something happened to her foot, and 










gangrene set in. On account of the foul smell, no one could enter her room. I told the incident to 










Hazra and asked him not to hate anyone." 





































MASTER IN SPIRITUAL MOOD 



















Toward evening, as Sri Ramakrishna was standing in the northwest corner of the courtyard, 










he went into samadhi. In those days the Master remained almost always in an ecstatic state. He 










would lose consciousness of the world at the slightest suggestion from outside. But for scant 










conversation with visiting devotees, he remained in an indrawn mood and was unable to perform 










his daily worship and devotions. 



















Coming down to the relative world, he began to talk to the Divine Mother, still standing 










where he was. "0 Mother," he said, "worship has left me, and japa also. Please see, Mother, that I 










do not become an inert thing. Let my attitude toward God be that of the servant toward the 










master. Mother, let me talk about Thee and chant Thy holy name. I want to sing Thy glories. 










Give me a little strength of body that I may move about, that I may go to places where Thy 










devotees live, and sing Thy name." 



















In the morning Sri Ramakrishna had been to the Kali temple to offer flowers at the Mother's 



















feet. 



















Continuing, the Master said: "0 Mother, I offered flowers at Thy feet this morning.thought: 










'That is good. My mind is again going back to formal worship.' Then why do I feel like this now? 










Why art Thou turning me into a sort of inert thing?" 



















The moon had not yet risen. It was a dark night. The Master, still in an abstracted mood, sat 










on the small couch in his room and continued his talk with the Divine Mother. He said: "Why this 










special discipline of the Gayatri? Why this jumping from this roof to that? Who told him to do it? 










Perhaps he is doing it of his own accord. . . . Well, he will practise a little of that discipline." 



















The previous day Sri Ramakrishna had discouraged Ishan about Vedic worship, saying that it 










was not suitable for the Kaliyuga. He had asked Ishan to worship God as the Divine Mother. 



















The Master said to M., "Are these all my fancies, or are they real?" M. remained silent with 










wonder at the Master's intimate relationship with the Divine Mother. He thought She must be 










within us as well as without. Indeed She must be very near us; or why should the Master speak to 










Her in a whisper? 



















Wednesday, September 26, 1883 



















There were very few devotees with the Master, for most of them came on Sundays. Rakhal 










and Latu were living with him the greater part of the time. M. arrived in the afternoon and found 










the Master seated on the small couch. The conversation turned to Narendra. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Have you seen Narendra lately? (With a smile) He said of me: 'He still 










goes to the Kali temple, But he will not when he truly understands.' His people are very much 










dissatisfied with him because he comes here now and then. The other day he came here in a hired 










carriage, and Surendra paid for it. Narendra's aunt almost had a row with Surendra about it." 



















The Master left the couch and went to the northeast verandah, where Hazra, Kishori, 










Rakhal , and a few other devotees were sitting. 





































MASTER (to M.): "How is it that you are here today? Have you no school?" 










M: "Our school closed today at half past one." 










MASTER: "Why so early?" 



















M: "Vidyasagar visited the school. He owns the school. So the boys get a half holiday 










whenever he comes." 



















EFFICACY OF TRUTHFULNESS 



















MASTER: "Why doesn't Vidyasagar keep his word? 'If one who holds to truth and looks on 










woman as his mother does not realize God, then Tulsi is a liar.' If a man holds to truth he will 










certainly realize God. The other day Vidyasagar said he would come here and visit me. But he 










hasn't kept his word." 



















DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCHOLAR AND HOLY MAN 



















"There is a big difference between a scholar and a holy man. The mind of a mere scholar is 










fixed on 'woman and gold', but the sadhu's mind is on the Lotus Feet of Hari. A scholar says one 










thing and does another. But it is quite a different matter with a sadhu. The words and actions of a 










man who has given his mind to the Lotus Feet of God are altogether different. In Benares I saw a 










young sannyasi who belonged to the sect of Nanak.. He was the same age as you. He used to refer 










to me as the 'loving monk'. His sect has a monastery in Benares. I was invited there one day. I 










found that the mohant was like a housewife. I asked him, 'What is the way?' 'For the Kaliyuga', he 










said, 'the path of devotion as enjoined by Narada.' He was reading a book. When the reading was 










over, he recited: 'Vishnu is in water, Vishnu is on land, Vishnu is on the mountain top; the whole 










world is pervaded by Vishnu.' At the end he said, 'Peace! Peace! Abiding Peace!' 



















PATH OF LOVE SUITED TO MODERN TIMES 



















"One day he was reading the Gita. He was so strict about his monastic rules that he would 










not read a holy book looking at a worldly man. So he turned his face toward me and his back on 










Mathur, who was also present. It was this holy man who told me of Narada's path of devotion as 










suited to the people of the Kaliyuga." 



















M: "Are not sadhus of his class followers of the Vedanta?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, they are. But they also accept the path of devotion. The fact is that in the 










Kaliyuga one cannot wholly follow the path laid down in the Vedas. Once a man said to me that he 










would perform the Purascharana of the Gayatri. I said: 'Why don't you do that according to the 










Tantra? In the Kaliyuga the discipline of Tantra is very efficacious.' 



















"It is extremely difficult to perform the rites enjoined in the Vedas. Further, at the present 










time people lead the life of slaves It is said that those who serve others for twelve years or so 










become slaves. They acquire the traits of those they serve. While serving their masters they 










acquire the rajas, the tamas, the spirit of violence, the love of luxury, and the other traits of their 





































masters. Not only do they serve their masters, but they also enjoy a pension after their term of 










service is over. 



















DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS MONKS 



















"Once a Vedantic monk came here. He used to dance at the sight of a cloud. He would go 










into an ecstasy of joy over a rain-storm. He would get very angry if, anyone went near him when 










he meditated. One day I came to him while he was meditating, and that made him very cross. He 










discriminated constantly, 'Brahman alone is real and the world is illusory.' Since the appearance of 










diversity is due to maya, he walked about with a prism from a chandelier in his hand. One sees 










different colours through the prism; in reality there is no such thing as colour. Likewise, nothing 










exists, in reality, except Brahman. But there is an appearance of the manifold because of maya, 










egoism. He would not look at an object more than once, lest he should be deluded by maya and 










attachment. He would discriminate, while taking his bath, at the sight of birds flying in the. sky. He 










knew grammar. He stayed here for three days. One day he heard the sound of a flute near the 










embankment and said that a man who had realized Brahman would go into samadhi at such a 










sound." 



















While talking about the monk, the Master showed his devotees the manners and 










movements of a paramahamsa: the gait of a child, face beaming with laughter, eyes swimming in 










joy, and body completely naked. Then he again took his seat on the small couch and poured out 










his soul-enthralling words. 



















MASTER (to M.): "I learnt Vedanta from Nangta: 'Brahman alone is real; the world is 










illusory.' The magician performs his magic. He produces a mango-tree which even bears 










mangoes. But this is all sleight of hand. The magician alone is real." 



















M: "It seems that the whole of life is a long sleep. This much I understand, that we are not 










seeing things rightly. We perceive the world with a mind by which we cannot comprehend even 










the nature of the sky. So how can our perceptions be correct?" 



















MASTER: "There is another way of looking at it. We do not see the sky rightly. It looks as if 










the sky were touching the ground at the horizon. How can a man see correctly? His mind is 










delirious, like the mind of a typhoid patient." 



















The Master sang in his sweet voice: 



















What a delirious fever is this that I suffer from! Mother, Thy grace is my only cure. . . 










Continuing, the Master said: "Truly it is a state of delirium. Just see how worldly men quarrel 










among themselves. No one knows what they quarrel about. Oh, how they quarrel! 'May such and 










such a thing befall you!' How much shouting! How much abuse!" 



















M: "I said to Kishori: The box is empty; there is nothing inside. But two men pull at it from 










either side, thinking the box contains money.' Well, the body alone is the cause of all this mischief, 










isn't it? The jnanis see all this and say to themselves, 'What a relief one feels when this pillow-case 










of the body drops off.'" 



















The Master and M. went toward the Kali temple. 





































MASTER: "Why should you say such things? This world may be a 'frame work of illusion', but 










it is also said that it is a 'mansion of mirth'. Let the body remain. One can also turn this world into a 










mansion of mirth." 



















M: "But where is unbroken bliss in this world?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, where is it?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna stood in front of the shrine of Kali and prostrated himself before the Divine 










Mother. M. followed him. Then the Master sat on the lower floor in front of the shrine room, 










facing the blissful image, and leaned against a pillar of the natmandir. He wore a red-bordered 










cloth, part of which was on his shoulder and back. M. sat by his side. 



















M: "Since there is no unbroken happiness in the world, why should one assume a body at 










all? I know that the body is meant only to reap the results of past action. But who knows what sort 










of action it is performing now? The unfortunate part is that we are being crushed." 



















MASTER: "If a pea falls into filth, it grows into a pea-plant none the less." 



















M: "But still there are the eight bonds." 



















Divine grace removes bondage 



















MASTER: "They are not eight bonds, but eight fetters. But what if they are? These fetters 










fall off in a moment, by the grace of God. Do you know what it is like? Suppose a room has been 










kept dark a thousand years. The moment a man brings a light into it, the darkness vanishes. Not 










little by little. Haven't you seen the magician's feat? He takes string with many knots, and ties one 










end to something, keeping the other in his hand. Then he shakes the string once or twice, and 










immediately all the knots come undone. But another man cannot untie the knots however he may 










try. All the knots of ignorance come undone in the twinkling of an eye, through the guru's grace. 



















"Well, can you tell me why Keshab Sen has changed so much lately? He used to come here 










very often. He learnt here how to bow low before a holy man. One day I told him that one should 










not salute a holy man as he had been doing. Harish says rightly: 'All the cheques must be approved 










here. Only then will they be cashed in the bank.'" (Laughter.) 



















M. listened to these words breathlessly. He began to realize that Satchidananda, in the form 










of the guru, passes the "cheque". 



















MASTER: "Do not reason. Who can ever know God? I have heard it from Nangta, once for 










all, that this whole universe is only a fragment of Brahman. 



















"Hazra is given to too much calculation. He says, 'This much of God has become the 










universe and this much is the balance.' My head aches at his calculations. I know that I know 










nothing. Sometimes I think of God as good, and sometimes as bad. What can I know of Him?" 



















M: "It is true, sir. Can anyone ever know God? Each thinks, with his little bit of intelligence, 










that he has understood all of God. As you say, an ant went to a sugar hill and, finding that one 





































grain of sugar filled its stomach, thought that the next time it would take the entire hill into its 










hole." 



















SURRENDER TO THE DIVINE MOTHER 



















MASTER: "Who can ever know God? I don't even try. I only call on Him as Mother. Let 










Mother do whatever She likes. I shall know Her if it is Her will; but I shall be happy to remain 










ignorant if She wills otherwise. My nature is that of a kitten. It only cries, 'Mew, mew!' The rest it 










leaves to its mother. The mother cat puts the kitten sometimes in the kitchen and sometimes on 










the master's bed. The young child wants only his mother. He doesn't know how wealthy his 










mother is, and he doesn't even want to know. He knows only, 'I have a mother; why should I 










worry?' Even the child of the maidservant knows that he has a mother. If he quarrels with the son 










of the master, he says: 'I shall tell my mother. I have a mother.' My attitude, too, is that of a child." 



















Suddenly Sri Ramakrishna caught M.'s attention and said, touching his own chest: "Well, 










there must be something here. Isn't that so?" 



















M. looked wonderingly at the Master. He said to himself: "Does the Mother Herself dwell in 










the Master's heart? Is it the Divine Mother who has assumed this human body for the welfare of 










humanity?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna was praying to the Divine Mother: "0 Mother! Embodiment of Om! 










Mother, how many things people say about Thee! But I don't understand any of them. I don't 










know anything, Mother. I have taken refuge at Thy feet. I have sought protection in Thee. 










Mother, I pray only that I may have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet, love that seeks no return. And 










Mother, do not delude me with Thy world-bewitching maya. I seek Thy protection. I have taken 










refuge in Thee." 



















The evening worship in the temples was over. Sri Ramakrishna was again seated in his room 










with M. 



















M. had been visiting the Master for the past two years and, had received his grace and 










blessings. He had been told that God was both with form and without form, that He assumed 










forms for the sake of His devotees. To the worshipper of the formless God, the Master said: "Hold 










to your conviction, but remember that all is possible with God. He has form, and again, He is 










formless. He can be many things more." 



















MASTER (to M.): "You have accepted an ideal, that of God without form-isn't that so?" 



















M: "Yes, sir. But I also believe what you say-that all is possible with God. It is quite possible 










for God to have forms. 



















MASTER: "Good. Remember further that, as Consciousness, He pervades the entire universe 










of the living and non-living." 



















M: "I think of Him as the consciousness in conscious beings." 





































MASTER: "Stick to that ideal now. There is no need of tearing down and changing one's 










attitude. You will gradually come to realize that the consciousness in conscious beings is the 










Consciousness of God. He alone is Consciousness. 



















"Let me ask you one thing. Do you feel attracted to money and treasures?" 



















M: "No, sir. But I think of earning money in order to be free from anxiety, to be able to think 










of God without worry." 



















MASTER: "Oh, that's perfectly natural." 



















M: "Is it greed? I don't think so." 



















MASTER: "You are right. Otherwise, who will look after your children? What will become of 










them if you feel that you are not the doer?" 



















M: "I have heard that one cannot attain Knowledge as long as one has the consciousness of 










duty. Duty is like the scorching sun." 



















MASTER: "Keep your present attitude. It will be different when the consciousness of duty 










drops away of itself." 



















They remained silent a few minutes. 



















M: "To enter the world after attaining partial knowledge! Why, it is like dying in full 










consciousness, as in cholera!" 



















MASTER: "Oh, Ram! Ram!" 



















The idea in M.'s mind was that just as a cholera patient feels excruciating pain at the time of 










death, because of retaining consciousness, so also a Jnani with partial knowledge must feel 










extremely miserable leading the life of the world, which he knows to be illusory. 



















M: "People who are completely ignorant are like typhoid patients, who remain unconscious 










at the time of death and so do not feel the pain." 





































MASTER: "Tell me, what does one attain through money? Jaygopal Sen is such a wealthy 










man; but he complains that his children don't obey him." 



















M: "Is poverty the only painful thing in the world? There are the six passions besides. Then 










disease and grief." 



















MASTER: "And also name and fame, the desire to win people's recognition. Well, what do 










you think my attitude is?" 



















M: "It is like that of a man just awakened from sleep. He becomes aware of himself. You are 










always united with God." 



















MASTER: "Do you ever dream of me?" 





































M: "Yes, sir. Many times." 



















MASTER: "How? Did you dream of me as giving you instruction?" 










M. remained silent. 



















MASTER: "If you ever see me instructing you, then know that it is Satchidananda Himself 










that does so." 



















M. related his dream experiences to Sri Ramakrishna, who listened to them attentively. 










MASTER (to M.): "That is very good. Don't reason any more. You are a follower of Sakti." 










Wednesday, October 10, 1883 



















VISIT TO ADHAR'S HOUSE 



















Adhar had invited the Master to come to his house on the occasion of the Durga Puja 










festival. It was the third day of the worship of the Divine Mother. When Sri Ramakrishna arrived at 










Adhar's house, he found Adhar's friend Sarada, Balaram's father, and Adhar's neighbours and 










relatives waiting for him. 



















The Master went into the worship hall to see the evening worship. When it was over, he 










remained standing there in an abstracted mood and sang in praise of the Divine Mother: 



















Glories of the Divine Mother Out of my deep affliction rescue me, Redeemer! 



















Terrified by the threats of the King of Death am I! Left to myself, I shall perish soon; Save 










me, oh, save me now, I pray! Mother of all the worlds! Thou, the Support of mankind! Thou, the 










Bewitcher of all, the Mother of all that has life! Vrindavan's charming Radha art Thou, Dearest 










playmate of Braja's Beloved. Blissful comrade of Krishna, well-spring of Krishna's lila, Child of 










Himalaya, best of the gopis, beloved of Govinda! Sacred Ganga, Giver of moksha! Sakti! The 










universe sings Thy praise. Thou art the Spouse of Siva, the Ever-blessed, the All; Sometimes Thou 










takest form and sometimes art absolute. Eternal Beloved of Mahadeva, Who can fathom Thine 










infinite glories? 



















The Master went to Adhar's drawing-room on the second floor and took a seat, surrounded 










by the guests. Still in a mood of divine fervour, he said: "Gentlemen, I have eaten. Now go and 










enjoy the feast." Was the Master hinting that the Divine Mother had partaken of Adhar's offering? 










Did he identify himself with the Divine Mother and therefore say, "I have eaten"? 



















Then, addressing the Divine Mother, he continued: "Shall I eat, Mother? Or will You eat? 










Mother, the very Embodiment of the Wine of Divine Bliss!" Did the Master look on himself as 










one with the Divine Mother? Had the Mother incarnated Herself as the Son to instruct mankind in 










the ways of God? Was this why the Master said, "I have eaten"? 



















In that state of divine ecstasy Sri Ramakrishna saw the six centres in his body, and the 










Divine Mother dwelling in them. He sang a song to that effect. 



















Again he sang: 





































My mind is overwhelmed with wonder, pondering the Mother's mystery; Her very name 










removes The fear of Kala, Death himself; Beneath Her feet lies Maha-Kala. 



















Why should Her hue be kala, black? Many the forms of black, but She Appears astoundingly 










black; when contemplated in the heart, She lights the lotus that blossoms there. 



















Her form is black, and She is named Kali, the Black One. Blacker than black Is She! Beholding 










Her, Man is bewitched for evermore; No other form can he enjoy. 



















In wonderment asks Ramprasad: Where dwells this Woman so amazing? At Her mere name, 










his mind becomes at once absorbed in Her, Though he has never yet beheld Her. 



















The fear of the devotees flies away if they but seek shelter at the feet of the Divine Mother. 










Was that why the Master sang the following song?: 



















I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the Mother; Am I afraid of Death any 










more? Unto the tuft of hair on my head Is tied the almighty mantra, Mother Kali's name. My body I 










have sold in the market-place of the world And with it have bought Sri Durga's name. Deep within 










my heart I have planted the name of Kali, The Wish-fulfilling Tree of heaven; When Yama, King of 










Death, appears, To him I shall open my heart and show it growing there. I have cast out from me 










my six unflagging foes; 



















Ready am I to sail life's sea, Crying, "To Durga, victory!" 



















Sarada was stricken with grief on account of his son's death. So Adhar had taken him to 










Dakshineswar to visit the Master. Sarada was a devotee of Sri Chaitanya. Sri Ramakrishna looked 










at him and was inspired with the ideal of Gauranga. 



















He sang: 



















Why has My body turned so golden? It is not time for this to be: Many the ages that must 










pass, before as Gauranga I appear. Here in the age of Dwapara My sport is not yet at an end; How 










strange this transformation is! The peacock glistens, all of gold; arid golden, too, the cuckoo 










gleams! Everything around Me here has turned to gold! Naught else appears But gold, whichever 










way I look. What can it mean, this miracle, that everything I see is gold? 



















Ah, I can guess its meaning now: 



















Radha has come to Mathura, and that is why My skin is gold. For she is like the bhramara, 










and so has given Me her hue. Dark blue My body was but now; yet in the twinkling of an eye It 










turned to gold. Have I become Radha by contemplating her? 



















I cannot imagine where I am-in Mathura or Navadvip. But how could this have come to 










pass? Not yet is Balarama born as Nitai, nor has Narada Become Srivas, nor Yasoda as Mother 










Sachi yet returned. Then why should I, among them all, alone assume a golden face? Not yet is 










Father Nanda born as Jagannath; then why should I Be thus transmuted into gold? Perhaps 










because in Mathura sweet Radha has appeared, My skin Has borrowed Gauranga's golden hue. 



















Sri Ramakrishna sang again, still overpowered with the ideal of Gauranga: 





































Surely Gauranga is lost in a state of blissful ecstasy; in an exuberance of joy, he laughs and 










weeps and dances and sings. He takes a wood for Vrindavan, the Ganges for the blue Jamuna; 










Loudly he sobs and weeps. Yet, though he is all gold without, He is all black within-black with the 










blackness of Krishna! 



















The Master continued to sing, assuming the attitude of a woman devotee infatuated with 










love for Gauranga: 



















Why do my neighbours raise such a scandal? Why do they cast aspersions upon me simply 










because of Gauranga? How can they understand my feelings? How can I ever explain? Can I ever 










explain at all? Alas, to whom shall I explain it? Ah, but they make me die of shame! Once on a time, 










at the house of Srivas, Gora was loudly singing the kirtan, when, on the ground of the courtyard, 










falling, he rolled in an ecstasy. I, who was standing near him, seeing him where he lay entranced 










was suddenly lost to outward sense until the wife of Srivas revived me. 



















Another day, in the bhaktas' procession, 



















Gora was sweetly singing the kirtan; clasping the outcastes to him, He softened the 










unbelievers' hearts. Through Nadia's market-place He chanted Lord Hari's holy name. I followed 










the throng, and from close by Caught a glimpse of his golden feet. 



















Once by the Ganges' bank he stood, His body bright as the sun and moon Charming all with 










his beauty. I too had come, to fetch some water, and, as I looked from one side, my water-jar 










slipped and fell to the ground. My sister-in-law, the gossip, saw me, and now she is spreading it 










everywhere. 



















Balaram's father was a Vaishnava; hence the Master also sang of the divine love of the gopis 










for their beloved Krishna: 



















I have not found my Krishna, friend! How cheerless my home without Him! Ah, if Krishna 










could only be the hair upon my head, carefully I should braid it then, and deck it with 










bakul-flowers; 



















Carefully I should fashion the braids out of my Krishna-hair. Krishna is black, and black is my 










hair; black would be one with black! Ah, if Krishna could only be the ring I wear in my nose, always 










from my nose He would hang, and my two lips could touch Him. But it can never be, alas! Why 










should I idly dream? Why should Krishna care at all to be the ring in my nose? 



















Ah, if Krishna could only be the bracelets on my arms, Always He would cling to my wrists, 










and proudly I should walk, Shaking my bracelets to make them sound, shaking my arms to show 










them; Down the king's highway I should walk, wearing my Krishna-bracelets. 



















Balaram's father was a wealthy man with estates in different parts of Orissa. An orthodox 










member of the Vaishnava sect, he had built temples and arranged for distribution of food to the 










pilgrims at various holy places. He had been spending the last years of his life in Vrindavan. The 










Vaishnavas, for the most part, are bigoted in their religious views. Some of them harbour malicious 










feelings toward the followers of the Tantra and Vedanta. But Sri Ramakrishna never encouraged 










such a narrow outlook. According to his teachings, through earnestness and yearning all lovers of 





































God will ultimately reach the same goal. The Master began the conversation in order to broaden 










the religious views of Balaram's father. 



















Master's harmony of religions 



















MASTER (to M.): "Once I thought, 'Why should I be one-sided?' Therefore I was initiated 










into Vaishnavism in Vrindavan and took the garb of a Vaishnava monk. I spent three days 










practising the Vaishnava discipline. Again, at Dakshineswar I was initiated into the mystery of 










Rama worship. I painted my forehead with a long mark and put on a string with a diamond round 










my neck. But after a few days I gave them up. 



















"A certain man had a tub. People would come to him to have their clothes dyed. The tub 










contained a solution of dye. Whatever colour a man wanted for his cloth, he would get by dipping 










the cloth in the tub. One man was amazed to see this and said to the dyer, 'Please give me the dye 










you have in your tub.' " 



















Was the Master hinting that people professing different religions would come to him and 










have their spiritual consciousness awakened according to their own ideals? 



















MASTER (to Balaram's father): "Don't read books any more. But you may read books on 










devotion, such as the life of Chaitanya. 



















"The whole thing is to love God and taste His sweetness. He is sweetness and the devotee is 










its enjoyer. The devotee drinks the sweet Bliss of God. Further, God is the lotus and the devotee 










the bee. The devotee sips the honey of the lotus. 



















"As a devotee cannot live without God, so also God cannot live without His devotee. Then 










the devotee becomes the sweetness, and God its enjoyer. The devotee becomes the lotus, and 










God the bee. It is the Godhead that has become these two in order to enjoy Its own Bliss. That is 










the significance of the episode of Radha and Krishna. 



















"At the beginning of spiritual life the devotee should observe such rites as pilgrimage, 










putting a string of beads around his neck, and so forth. But outward ceremonies gradually drop off 










as he attains the goal, the vision of God. Then his only activity is the repetition of God's name, and 










contemplation and meditation on Him. 



















"The pennies equivalent to sixteen rupees make a great heap. But sixteen silver coins do not 










look like such a big amount. Again, the quantity becomes much smaller when you change the 










sixteen rupees into one gold mohur. And if you change the gold into a tiny piece of diamond, 










people hardly notice it." 



















Orthodox Vaishnavas insist on the outer insignia of religion. They criticize any devotee who 










does not wear these marks. Was that why the Master said that, after the vision of God, a devotee 










becomes indifferent to outer marks, giving up formal worship when the goal of spiritual life is 










attained? 



















MASTER (to Balaram's father): "The Kartabhajas group the devotees into four classes: the 










pravartaka, the sadhaka, the siddha, and the siddha of the siddha. The pravartaka, the beginner, 





































puts the mark of his religion on his forehead, wears a string of beads around his neck, and 










observes other outer conventions. The sadhaka, the struggling devotee, does not care so much for 










elaborate rites. An example of this class is the Baul. The siddha, the perfect, firmly believes that 










God exists. The siddha of the siddha, the supremely perfect, like Chaitanya, not only has realized 










God but also has become intimate with Him and talks with Him all the time. This is the last limit of 










realization. 



















DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SPIRITUAL ASPIRANTS 



















"There are many kinds of spiritual aspirants. Those endowed with sattva perform their 










spiritual practices secretly. They look like ordinary people, but they meditate inside the mosquito 










net. 



















"Aspirants endowed with rajas exhibit outward pomp-a string of beads around the neck, a 










mark on the forehead, an ochre robe, a silk cloth, a rosary with a gold bead, and so on. They are 










like stall-keepers advertising their wares with signboards. 



















"All religions and all paths call upon their followers to pray to one and the same God. 










Therefore one should not show disrespect to any religion or religious opinion. It is God alone who 










is called Satchidananda Brahman in the Vedas, Satchidananda Krishna in the Puranas, and 










Satchidananda Siva in the Tantras. It is one and the same Satchidananda. 



















"There are different sects of Vaishnavas. That which is called Brahman in the Vedas is called 










Alekh-Niranjan by one Vaishnava sect. 'Alekh' means That which cannot be pointed out or 










perceived by the sense-organs. According to this sect, Radha and Krishna are only two bubbles of 










the Alekh. 



















"According to the Vedanta, there is no Incarnation of God. The Vedantists say that Rama 










and Krishna are but two waves in the Ocean of Satchidananda. 



















"In reality there are not two. There is only One. A man may call on God by any name; if he is 










sincere in his prayer he will certainly reach Him. He will succeed if he has longing." 



















As Sri Ramakrishna spoke these words to the devotees, he was overwhelmed with divine 










fervour. Coming down to partial consciousness of the world, he said to Balaram's father, "Are you 










the father of Balaram?" 



















All sat in silence. Balaram's aged father was silently telling his beads. 



















FUTILITY OF WORSHIP WITHOUT YEARNING 



















MASTER (to M. and the others): "Well, these people practise so much japa and go to so 










many sacred places, but why are they like this? Why, do they make no progress? In their case it 










seems as if the year consists of eighteen months. 



















"Once I said to Harish: 'What is the use of going to Benares if one does not feel restless for 










God? And if one feels that longing, then this very place is Benares.' 





































"They make so many pilgrimages and repeat the name of God so much, but why do they not 










realize anything? It is because they have no longing for God. God reveals Himself to the devotee if 










only he calls upon Him with a longing heart. 



















"At the beginning of a yatra performance much light-hearted restlessness is to be observed 










on the stage. At that time one does not see Krishna. Next the sage Narada enters with his flute and 










sings longingly, '0 Govinda! my Life! my Soul!' Then Krishna can no longer remain away and 










appears with the cowherd boys." 



















Tuesday, October 16, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna was in his room with Rakhal , Balaram's father, Beni Pal, M., Mani Mallick, 










Ishan, Kishori, and other devotees. 



















MASTER: "Liberal-minded devotees accept all the forms of God: Krishna, Kali, Siva, Rama, 










and so on." 



















BALARAM'S FATHER: "Yes, sir. It is like a woman's recognizing her husband, whatever 










clothes he wears." 



















Unwavering devotion to God 



















MASTER: "But again, there is a thing called nishtha, single-minded devotion. When the gopis 










went to Mathura they saw Krishna with a turban on His head. At this they pulled down their veils 










and said, 'Who is this man? Where is our Krishna with the peacock feather on His crest and the 










yellow cloth on His body?' Hanuman also had that unswerving devotion. He came to Dwaraka in 










the cycle of Dwapara. Krishna said to Rukmini, His queen, 'Hanuman will not be satisfied unless he 










sees the form of Rama.' so, to please Hanuman, Krishna assumed the form of Rama. 



















"But, my dear sir, I am in a peculiar state of mind. My mind constantly descends from the 










Absolute to the Relative, and again ascends from the Relative to the Absolute. 



















"The attainment of the Absolute is called the Knowledge of Brahman. But it is extremely 










difficult to acquire. A man cannot acquire the Knowledge of Brahman unless he completely rids 










himself of his attachment to the world. When the Divine Mother was born as the daughter of King 










Himalaya, She showed Her various forms to Her father. The king said, 'I want to see Brahman.' 










Thereupon the Divine Mother said: 'Father, if that is your desire, then you must seek the company 










of holy men. You must go into solitude, away from the world, and now and then live in holy 










company.' 



















THE MANY AND THE ONE 



















"The manifold has come from the One alone, the Relative from the Absolute. There is a 










state of consciousness where the many disappears, and the One, as well; for the many must exist 










as long as the One exists. Brahman is without comparison. It is impossible to explain Brahman by 










analogy. It is between light and darkness. It is Light, but not the light that we perceive, not material 










light. 





































"Again, when God changes the state of my mind, when He brings my mind down to the 










plane of the Relative, I perceive that it is He who has become all these-the Creator, maya, the 










living beings, and the universe. 



















"Again, sometimes He shows me that He has created the universe and all living beings. He is 










the Master, and the universe His garden. 



















KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE 



















'"He is the Master, and the universe and all its living beings belong to Him'-that is 










Knowledge. And, 'I am the doer', 'I am the guru', 'I am the father'-that is ignorance. 'This is my 










house; this is my family; this is my wealth; these are my relatives'-this also is ignorance." 



















BALARAM'S FATHER: "That is true, sir." 



















MASTER: "As long as you do not feel that God is the Master, you must come back to the 










world, you must be born again and again. There will be no rebirth when you can truly say, '0 God, 










Thou art the Master.' As long as you cannot say, '0 Lord, Thou alone art real', you will not be 










released from the life of the world. This going and coming, this rebirth, is inevitable. There will be 










no liberation. Further, what can you achieve by saying, 'It is mine'? The manager of an estate may 










say, 'This is our garden; these are our couches and furniture.' But when he is dismissed by the 










master, he hasn't the right to take away even a chest of worthless mango-wood given to him for 










his use. 



















"The feeling of 'I and mine' has covered the Reality. Because of this we do not see Truth. 










Attainment of Chaitanya, Divine Consciousness, is not possible without the knowledge of Advaita, 










Non-duality. After realizing Chaitanya one enjoys Nityananda, Eternal Bliss. One enjoys this Bliss 










after attaining the state of a paramahamsa. 



















"Vedanta does not recognize the Incarnation of God. According to it, Chaitanyadeva is only 










a bubble of the non-dual Brahman. 



















"Do you know what the vision of Divine Consciousness is like? It is like the sudden 










illumination of a dark room when a match is struck. 



















"The Incarnation of God is accepted by those who follow the path of bhakti. A woman 










belonging to the Kartabhaja sect observed my condition, and remarked: 'You have inner 










realization. Don't dance and sing too much. Ripe grapes must be preserved carefully in cotton. The 










mother-in-law lessens her daughter-in-law's activities when the daughterin-law is with child. One 










characteristic of God-realization is that the activities of a man with such realization gradually drop 










away. Inside this man [meaning Sri Ramakrishna] is the real Jewel.' 



















"Watching me eat, she remarked, 'Sir, are you yourself eating, or are you feeding someone 



















else?' 



















"The feeling of ego has covered the Truth. Narendra once said, 'As the "I" of man recedes, 










the "I" of God approaches.' Kedar says, 'The more clay there is in the jar, the less water it holds.' 





































"Krishna said to Arjuna: 'Brother, you will not realize Me if you possess even one of the 










eight siddhis.' These give only a little power. With healing and the like one may do only a little 










good to others. Isn't that true? 



















"Therefore I prayed to the Divine Mother for pure love only, a love that does not seek any 










return. I never, asked for occult powers." 



















While talking thus, Sri Ramakrishna went into samadhi. He sat there motionless, completely 










forgetful of the outer world. Then, coming down to the sense world, he sang: 



















Ah, friend! I have not found Him yet, whose love has driven me mad. . . . 



















At the Master's request, Ramlal sang a song describing how Chaitanya embraced the 










monastic life: 



















Oh, what a vision I have beheld in Keshab Bharati's hut! Gora, in all his matchless grace, 










Shedding tears in a thousand streams! 



















Like a mad elephant He dances in ecstasy and sings, Drunk with an overwhelming love. 



















Rolling flat upon the ground and swimming in his tears, He weeps and shouts Lord Hari's 










name, Piercing the very heavens with his cries, Loud as a lion's roar; Then most humbly he begs 










men's love, To feel himself the servant of Cod. 



















Shorn of his locks, he has put on the yogi's ochre robe; Even the hardest heart must melt to 










see his pure and heavenly love. Smitten by man's deep woe, He has abandoned everything and 










pours out love unstintingly. 



















Oh, would that Premdas were his slave and, passing from door to door, Might sing 










Gauranga's endless praise! 



















The Master asked Mani Mallick to quote the words of Tulsidas to the effect that one who 










had developed love of God could not observe caste distinctions. 



















MANI: "The throat of the chatak bird is pierced with thirst. All around are the waters of the 










Ganges, the Jamuna, the Saraju, and of innumerable other rivers and lakes; but the bird will not 










touch any of these. It only looks up expectantly for the rain that falls when the star Svati is in the 










ascendant." 



















MASTER: "That means that love for the Lotus Feet of God is alone real, and all else illusory." 



















MANI: "Tulsi also said: 'At the touch of the philosopher's stone, the eight metals become 










gold. Likewise all castes, even the butcher and the untouchable, become pure by repeating Hari's 










name. Without Hari's name the people of the four castes are but butchers.'" 



















MASTER: "The hide that the scriptures forbid one to touch can be taken inside the temple 










after it has been tanned. 





































CHANTING GOD'S HOLY NAME 



















"Man becomes pure by repeating the name of God. Therefore one should practise the 










chanting of God's name. I said to Jadu Mallick's mother: 'In the hour of death you will think only of 










worldly things-of family, children, executing the will, and so forth. The thought of God will not 










come to your mind. The way to remember God in the hour of death is to practise, now, the 










repetition of His name and the chanting of His glories. If one keeps up this practice, then in the 










hour of death one will repeat the name of God. When the cat pounces upon the bird, the bird only 










squawks and does not say, 'Rama, Rama, Hare-Krishna'. 



















"It is good to prepare for death. One should constantly think of God and chant His name in 










solitude during the last years of one's life. If the elephant is put into the stable after its bath it is 










not soiled again by dirt and dust." 



















Balaram's father, Mani Mallick, and Beni Pal were all elderly men. Did the Master give this 










instruction especially for their benefit? 



















MASTER: "Why do I ask you to think of God and chant His name in solitude? Living in the 










world day and night, one suffers from worries. Haven't you noticed brother killing brother for a 










foot of land? The Sikhs said to me, 'the cause of all worry and confusion is these three: land, 










woman, and money.' 



















"You are leading a householder's life. Why should you be afraid of the world? When Rama 










said to Dasaratha that He was going to renounce the world, it worried His father, and the king 










sought counsel of Vasishtha. Vasishtha said to Rama: 'Rama, why should You give up the world? 










Reason with me; is this world outside God? What is there to renounce and what is there to accept? 










Nothing whatever exists but God. It is Brahman alone that appears as Isvara, maya, living beings, 










and the universe.' " 



















BALARAM'S FATHER: "It is very difficult, sir." 



















MASTER: "The aspirant, while practising spiritual discipline, looks upon the world as a 










'framework of illusion'. Again, after the attainment of Knowledge, the vision of God, this very 










world becomes to him a 'mansion of mirth'. 



















"It is written in the books of the Vaishnavas: 'God can be attained through faith alone; 










reasoning pushes Him far away.' Faith alone! 



















"What faith Krishnakishore had! At Vrindavan a low-caste man drew water for him from a 










well. Krishnakishore said to him, 'Repeat the name of Siva.' After the man had repeated the name 










of Siva, Krishnakishore unhesitatingly drank the water. He used to say, 'If a man chants the name 










of God, does he need to spend money any more for the atonement of his sins? How foolish!' He 










was amazed to see people worshipping God with the sacred tulsi-leaf in order to get rid of their 










illnesses. At the bathing-ghat here he said to us, 'Please bless me, that I may pass my days 










repeating Rama's holy name.' Whenever I went to his house he would dance with joy at the sight 










of me. Rama said to Lakshmana, 'Brother, whenever you find people singing and dancing in the 










ecstasy of divine love, know for certain that I am there.' Chaitanya is an example of such ecstatic 





































love. He laughed and wept and danced and sang in divine ecstasy. He was an Incarnation. God 










incarnated Himself through Chaitanya." 



















Sri Ramakrishna sang a song describing the divine love of Chaitanya. Then Balaram's father, 










Mani Mallick, Beni Pal, and several other devotees took leave of the Master. 



















In the evening, devotees from Kansaritola, Calcutta, arrived. The Master danced and sang 










with them in a state of divine fervour. After dancing, he went into a spiritual mood and said, "I 










shall go part of the way myself." Kishori came forward to massage his feet, but the Master did not 










allow anyone to touch him. 



















Ishan arrived. The Master was seated, still in a spiritual mood. After a while he became 










engaged in talk with Ishan. It was Ishan's desire to practise the Purascharana of the Gayatri. 



















MASTER (to Ishan): "Follow your own intuition. I hope there is no more doubt in your mind. 










Is there any? The path of the Vedas is not meant for the Kaliyuga. The path of Tantra is 










efficacious." 



















ISHAN: "I have almost resolved to perform an atonement ceremony." 



















MASTER: "Do you mean to say that one cannot follow the path of Tantra? That which is 










Brahman is also Sakti, Kali. Knowing the secret that Kali is one with the highest Brahman, I have 










discarded, once for all, both righteousness and sin." 



















ISHAN: "It is mentioned in a hymn in the Chandi that Brahman alone is the Primal Energy. 










Brahman is identical with Sakti." 



















MASTER: "It will not do simply to express that idea in words. Only when you assimilate it 










will all be well with you. 



















"When the heart becomes pure through the practice of spiritual discipline, then one rightly 










feels that God alone is the Doer. He alone has become mind, life, and intelligence. We are only His 










instruments. Thou it is that holdest the elephant in the mire; Thou, that helpest the lame man 










scale the loftiest hill. 



















"When your heart becomes pure, then you will realize that it is God who makes us perform 










such rites as the Purascharana. 



















Thou workest Thine own work; men only call it theirs. 



















"All doubts disappear after the realization of God. Then the devotee meets the favourable 










wind. He becomes free from worry. He is like the boatman who, when the favourable wind blows, 










unfurls the sail, holds the rudder lightly, and enjoys a smoke." 



















Ishan took his leave and Sri Ramakrishna talked with M. No one else was present. He asked 










M. what he thought of Narendra, Rakhal , Adhar, and Hazra, and whether they were guileless. 










"And", asked the Master, "what do you think of me?". 



















M. said: "You are simple and at the same time deep. It is extremely difficult to understand 



















you." 





































Sri Ramakrishna laughed. 










November 26, 1883 



















It was the day of the annual festival of the Sinduriapatti Brahmo Samaj. The ceremony was 










to be performed in Manilal Mallick's house. The worship hall was beautifully decorated with 










flowers, wreaths, and evergreens, and many devotees were assembled, eagerly awaiting the 










worship. Their enthusiasm had been greatly heightened by the news that Sri Ramakrishna was 










going to grace the occasion with his presence. Keshab, Vijay, Shivanath, and other leaders of the 










Brahmo Samaj held him in high respect. His God intoxicated state of mind, his intense love of 










spiritual life, his burning faith, his intimate communion with God, and his respect for women, 










whom he regarded as veritable manifestations of the Divine Mother, together with the unsullied 










purity of his character, his complete renunciation of worldly talk, his love and respect for all 










religious faiths, and his eagerness to meet devotees of all creeds, attracted the members of the 










Brahmo Samaj to him. Devotees came that day from far-off places to join the festival, for it would 










give them a chance to get a glimpse of the Master and listen to his inspiring talk. 



















Sri Ramakrishna arrived at the house before the worship began, and became engaged in 










conversation with Vijaykrishna Goswami and the other devotees. The lamps were lighted and the 










divine service was about to begin. 



















The Master asked if Shivanath would come to the festival. A Brahmo devotee said that he 










had other important things to do and was not coming. 



















TRUTHFULNESS LEADS TO GOD 



















MASTER: "I feel very happy when I see Shivanath. He always seems to be absorbed in the 










bliss of bhakti. Further, a man who is respected by so many surely possesses some divine power. 










But he has one great defect: he doesn't keep his word. Once he said to me that, he would come to 










Dakshineswar, but he neither came nor sent me word. That is not good. It is said that truthfulness 










alone constitutes the spiritual discipline of the Kaliyuga. If a man clings tenaciously to truth he 










ultimately realizes God. Without this regard for truth, one gradually loses everything. If by chance I 










say that I will go to the pine-grove, I must go there even if there is no further need of it, lest I lose 










my attachment to truth. After my vision of the Divine Mother, I prayed to Her, taking a flower in 










my hands: 'Mother, here is Thy knowledge and here is Thy ignorance. Take them both, and give me 










only pure love. Here is Thy holiness and here is Thy unholiness. Take them both, Mother, and give 










me pure love. Here is Thy good and here is Thy evil. Take them both, Mother, and give me pure 










love. Here is Thy righteousness, and here is Thy unrighteousness. Take them both, Mother, and 










give me pure love.' I mentioned all these, but I could not say: 'Mother, here is Thy truth and here is 










Thy falsehood. Take them both.' I gave up everything at Her feet but could not bring myself to give 










up truth." 



















Soon the service began according to the rules of the Brahmo Samaj. The preacher was 










seated on the dais. After the opening prayer he recited holy texts of the Vedas and was joined by 










the congregation in the invocation to the Supreme Brahman. They chanted in chorus: "Brahman is 










Truth, Knowledge, and Infinity. It shines as Bliss and Immortality. 





































Brahman is Peace, Blessedness, the One without a Second; It is pure and unstained by sin." 










The minds of the devotees were stilled, and they closed their eyes in meditation. 



















The Master went into deep samadhi. He sat there transfixed and speechless. After some 










time he opened his eyes, looked around, and suddenly stood up with the words "Brahma! 










Brahma!" on his lips. Soon the devotional music began, accompanied by drums and cymbals. In a 










state of divine fervour the Master began to dance with the devotees. Vijay and the other Brahmos 










danced around him. The guests and the devotees were enchanted. Many of them drank the sweet 










bliss of God's name and forgot the world. The happiness of the material world appeared bitter to 










them, at least for the time being. 



















After the kirtan all sat around the Master, eager to hear his words. 



















ADVICE TO HOUSEHOLDERS 



















MASTER: "It is difficult to lead the life of a householder in a spirit of detachment. Once 










Pratap said to me: 'Sir, we follow the example of King Janaka. He led the life of a householder in a 










detached spirit. We shall follow him.' I said to him: 'Can one be like King Janaka by merely wishing 










it? How many austerities he practised in order to acquire divine knowledge! He practised the most 










intense form of asceticism for many years and only then returned to the life of the world.' 



















"Is there, then, no hope for householders? Certainly there is. They must practise spiritual 










discipline in solitude for some days. Thus they will acquire knowledge and devotion. Then it will 










not hurt them to lead the life of the world. But when you practise discipline in solitude, keep 










yourself entirely away from your family. You must not allow your wife, son, daughter, mother, 










father, sister, brother, friends, or relatives near you. While thus practising discipline in solitude, 










you should think: 'I have no one else in the world. God is my all.' You must also pray to Him, with 










tears in your eyes, for knowledge and devotion. 



















"If you ask me how long you should live in solitude away from your family, I should say that 










it would be good for you if you could spend even one day in such a manner. Three days at a time 










are still better. One may live in solitude for twelve days, a month, three months, or a year, 










according to one's convenience and ability. One hasn't much to fear if one leads the life of a 










householder after attaining knowledge and devotion. 



















"If you break a jack-fruit after rubbing your hands with oil, then its sticky milk will not smear 










your hands. While playing the game of hide-and-seek, you are safe if you but once touch the 










'granny'. Be turned into gold by touching the philosopher's stone. After that you may remain 










buried underground a thousand years; when you are taken out you will still be gold. 



















"The mind is like milk. If you keep the mind in the world, which is like water, then the milk 










and water will get mixed. That is why people keep milk in a quiet place and let it set into curd, and 










then churn butter from it. Likewise, through spiritual discipline practised in solitude, churn the 










butter of knowledge and devotion from the milk of the mind. Then that butter can easily be kept in 










the water of the world. It will not get mixed with the world. The mind will float detached on the 










water of the world." 





































Vijay had just returned from Gaya, where he had spent a long time in solitude and holy 










company. He had put on the ochre robe of a monk and was in an exalted state of mind, always 










indrawn. He was sitting before the Master with his head bent down, as if absorbed in some deep 










thought. 



















Casting his benign glance on Vijay, the Master said: "Vijay, have you found your room? 



















"Let me tell you a parable: Once two holy men, in the course of their wanderings, entered a 










city. One of them, with wondering eyes and mouth agape, was looking at the market-place, the 










stalls, and the buildings, when he met his companion. The latter said: 'You seem to be filled with 










wonder at the city. Where is your baggage?' He replied: 'First of all I found a room. I put my things 










in it, locked the door, and felt totally relieved. Now I am going about the city enjoying all the fun.' 



















"So I am asking you, Vijay, if you have found your room. (To M. and the others) You see, 










the spring in Vijay's heart has been covered all these days. Now it is open. . . 



















(To V ijay) "Well, Shivanath is always in trouble and turmoil. He has to write for magzines 










and perform many other duties. Worldly duties bring much worry and anxiety along with them. 



















"It is narrated in the Bhagavata that the Avadhuta had twenty-four gurus, one of whom was 










a kite. In a certain place the fishermen were catching fish. A kite swooped down and snatched a 










fish. At the sight of the fish, about a thousand crows chased the kite and made a great noise with 










their cawing. Whichever way the kite flew with the fish, the crows followed it. The kite flew to the 










south and the crows followed it there. The kite flew to the north and still the crows followed after 










it. The kite went east and west, but with the same result. As the kite began to fly about in 










confusion, lo, the fish dropped from its mouth. The crows at once let the kite alone and flew after 










the fish. Thus relieved of its worries, the kite sat on the branch of a tree and thought: 'That 










wretched fish was at the root of all my troubles. I have now got rid of it and therefore I am at 










peace.' 



















"The Avadhuta learnt this lesson from the kite, that as long as a man has the fish, that is, 










worldly desires, he must perform actions and consequently suffer from worry, anxiety, and 










restlessness. No sooner does he renounce these desires than his activities fall away and he enjoys 










peace of soul. 



















"But work without any selfish motive is good. It does not create any worry. But it is very 










difficult to be totally unselfish. We may think that our work is selfless, but selfishness comes, 










unknown to us, from no one knows where. But if a man has already undergone great spiritual 










discipline, then as a result of it he may be able to do work without any selfish motive. After the 










vision of God a man can easily do unselfish work. 



















In most cases action drops away after the attainment of God. Only a few, like Narada, work 










to bring light to mankind. 



















"The Avadhuta accepted a bee as another teacher. Bees accumulate their honey by days of 










hard labour. But they cannot enjoy their honey, for a man soon breaks the comb and takes it away. 










The Avadhuta learnt this lesson from the bees, that one should not lay things up. Sadhus should 





































depend one hundred per cent on God. They must not gather for the morrow. But this does not 










apply to the householder. He must bring up his family; therefore it is necessary for him to provide. 










Birds and monks do not hoard. Yet birds also hoard after their chicks are hatched: they collect food 










in their beaks for their young ones. 



















"Let me tell you one thing, Vijay. Don't trust a sadhu if he keeps bag, and baggage with him 










and a bundle of clothes with many knots. I have seen such sadhus under the banyan tree in the 










Panchavati. Two or three of them were seated there. One was picking over lentils, some were 










sewing their clothes, and all were gossiping about a feast they had enjoyed in a rich man's house. 










They said among themselves, 'That rich man spent a hundred thousand rupees on the feast and 










fed the sadhus sumptuously with cake, sweets, and many such delicious things.' " (All laugh) 



















VIJAY: "It is true, sir. I have seen such sadhus at Gaya. They are called the lotawalla sadhus 










of Gaya." 



















MASTER (to Vijay): "When love of God is awakened, work drops away of itself. If God makes 










some men work, let them work. It is now time for you to give up everything. Renounce all and say, 










'0 mind, may you and I alone behold the Mother, letting no One else intrude.' " 



















Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna began to sing in his soul-enthralling voice: 



















Cherish my precious Mother Syama Tenderly within, mind; May you and I alone behold 










Her, Letting no one else intrude. 



















mind, in solitude enjoy Her, Keeping the passions all outside; Take but the tongue, that 










now and again It may cry out, "0 Mother! Mother!" 



















Suffer no breath of base desire To enter and approach us there, But bid true knowledge 










stand on guard, Alert and watchful evermore. 



















The Master said to Vijay: "Surrender yourself completely to God, and set aside all such 










things as fear and shame. Give up such feelings as, 'What will people think of me if I dance in the 










ecstasy of God's holy name?' The saying, 'One cannot have the vision of God as long as one has 










these three- shame, hatred, and fear', is very true. Shame, hatred, fear, caste, pride, secretiveness, 










and the like are so many bonds. Man is free when he is liberated from all these. 



















"When bound by ties one is jiva, and when free from ties one is Siva. Prema, ecstatic love of 










God, is a rare thing. 



















STEPS OF BHAKTI 



















"First of all one acquires bhakti. Bhakti is single-minded devotion to God, like the devotion a 










wife feels for her husband. It is very difficult to have unalloyed devotion to God. Through such 










devotion one's mind and soul merge in Him. 



















"Then comes bhava, intense love. Through bhava a man becomes speechless. His nerve 










currents are stilled. Kumbhaka comes by itself. It is like the case of a man whose breath and 










speech stop when he fires a gun. 





































"But prema, ecstatic love, is an extremely rare thing. Chaitanya had that love. When one has 










prema one forgets all outer things. One forgets the world. One even forgets one's own body, 










which is so dear to a man." 



















The Master began to sing: 



















Oh, when will dawn the blessed day when tears of joy will flow from my eyes as I repeat 










Lord Hari's name? Oh, when will dawn the blessed day when all my craving for the world will 










vanish straightway from my heart, And with the thrill of His holy name All of my hair will stand on 










end? Oh, when will dawn that blessed day? 



















So the talk of divine things was proceeding, when some invited Brahmo devotees entered 










the room. There were among them a few pundits and high government officials. 



















Sri Ramakrishna had said that bhava stills the nerve currents of the devotee. He continued: 










"When Arjuna was about to shoot at the target, the eye of a fish, his eyes were fixed on the eye of 










the fish, and on nothing else. He didn't even notice any part of the fish except the eye. In such a 










state the breathing stops and one experiences kumbhaka. 



















"Another characteristic of God-vision is that a great spiritual current rushes up along the 










spine and goes toward the brain. If then the devotee goes into samadhi, he sees God." 



















Looking at the Brahmo devotees who had just arrived, the Master said: "Mere pundits, 










devoid of divine love, talk incoherently. Pundit Samadhyayi once said, in the course of 



















his sermon: 'God is dry. Make Him sweet by your love and devotion.' Imagine! To describe 










Him, as dry, whom the Vedas declare as the Essence of Bliss! It makes one feel that the pundit 










didn't know what God really is. That was why his words were so incoherent. 



















"A man once said, 'There are many horses in my uncle's cow-shed.' From that one could 










know that the man had no horses at all. No one keeps a horse in a cow-shed. 



















TRANSITORINESS OF EARTHLY THINGS 



















"Some people pride themselves on their riches and power-their wealth, honour, and social 










position. But these are only transitory. Nothing will remain with you in death. 



















"There is a song that runs: 



















Remember this, mind! Nobody is your own: Vain is your wandering in this world. Trapped 










in the subtle snare of maya as you are, do not forget the Mother's name. 



















Only a day or two men honour you on earth As lord and master; all too soon That form, so 










honoured now, must needs be cast away, When Death, the Master, seizes you. 



















Even your beloved wife, for whom, while yet you live, you fret yourself almost to death, Will 










not go with you then; she too will say farewell, And shun your corpse as an evil thing. 



















"One must not be proud of one's money. If you say that you are rich, then one can remind 










you that there are richer men than you, and others richer still, and so on. At dusk the glow-worm 





































comes out and thinks that it lights the world. But its pride is crushed when the stars appear in the 










sky. The stars feel that they give light to the earth. But when the moon rises the stars fade in 










shame. The moon feels that the world smiles at its light and that it lights the earth. Then the 










eastern horizon becomes red, and the sun rises. The moon fades and after a while is no longer 










seen. 



















"If wealthy people would think that way, they would get rid of their pride in their wealth." 



















Manilal had provided a sumptuous feast in celebration of the festival. He entertained the 










Master and the other guests with great love and attention. It was late at night when they returned 










to their homes. 



















LAST VISIT TO KESHAB 



















Wednesday, November 28, 1883 



















AT TWO O'CLOCK in the afternoon, M. was pacing the foot-path of the Circular Road in front 










of the Lily Cottage, where Keshab Chandra Sen lived. He was eagerly awaiting the arrival of Sri 










Ramakrishna. Keshab's illness had taken a serious turn, and there was very little chance of his 










recovery. Since the Master loved Keshab dearly, he was coming from Dakshineswar to pay him a 










visit. 



















On the east side of the Circular Road was Victoria College, where the ladies of Keshab's 










Brahmo Samaj and their daughters received their education. To the north of the college was a 










spacious garden house inhabited by an English family. M. noticed that there was a commotion in 










the house and wondered what was going on. Presently a hearse arrived with the drivers dressed in 










black, and the members of the household appeared, looking very sad. There had been a death in 










the family. 



















"Whither does the soul go, leaving behind this mortal body?" Pondering the age-old 










question, M. waited, watching the carriages that came from the north. 



















Master's visit to Keshab 



















About five o'clock a carriage stopped in front of the Lily Cottage and Sri Ramakrishna got 










out with Latu and several other devotees, including Rakhal . He was received by Keshab's relatives, 










who led him and the devotees upstairs to the verandah south of the drawing-room. The Master 










seated himself on a couch. 



















After a long wait he became impatient to see Keshab. Keshab's disciples said that he was 










resting and would be there presently. Sri Ramakrishna became more and more impatient and said 










to Keshab's disciples: "Look here, what need is there of his coming to me? Why can't I go in and 










see him?" 



















PRASANNA (humbly): "Sir, he will come in a few minutes." 



















MASTER: "Go away! It is you who are making all this fuss. Let me go in." Prasanna began to 










talk about Keshab in order to divert the Master's attention. He said: "Keshab is now an altogether 





































different person. Like you, sir, he talks to the Divine Mother. He hears what the Mother says, and 










laughs and cries." 



















When he was told that Keshab talked to the Divine Mother and laughed and cried, the 










Master became ecstatic. Presently he went into samadhi. 



















It was winter and the Master was wearing a green flannel coat with a shawl thrown over it. 










He sat straight, with his eyes fixed, deep in ecstasy. A long time passed in this way. There was no 










indication of his returning to the normal plane of consciousness. 



















Gradually it became dark. Lamps were lighted in the drawing-room, where the Master was 










now to go. While he was slowly coming down to the plane of ordinary consciousness, he was taken 










there, though with great difficulty. The room was well furnished. At the sight of the furniture, the 










Master muttered to himself, "These things were necessary before, but of what use are they now?" 










Seeing Rakhal, he said, "Oh, hello! Are you here?" Then, seating himself on a couch, he again lost 










consciousness of the outer world, and, looking around as if seeing someone, he said: "Hello, 










Mother! I see that You too have come. How You are showing off in Your Benares sari! Don't bother 










me now, please. Sit down and be quiet." 



















The Master was in a state of intense divine intoxication. In the well-lighted room the 










Brahmo devotees sat around the Master; Latu, Rakhal, and M. remained near him. He was saying 










to himself, still filled with divine fervour: "The body and the soul! The body was born and it will die. 










But for the soul there is no death. It is like the betel-nut. When the nut is ripe it does not stick to 










the shell. But when it is green it is difficult to separate it from the shell. After realizing God, one 










does not identify oneself any more with the body. Then one knows that body and soul are two 










different things." 



















Keshab's serious illness 



















At this moment Keshab entered the room. He came through the east door. Those who 










remembered the man who had preached in the Town Hall or the Brahmo Samaj temple were 










shocked to see this skeleton covered with skin. He could hardly stand. He walked holding to the 










wall for support. With great difficulty he sat down in front of the couch. In the mean time Sri 










Ramakrishna had got down from the couch and was sitting on the floor. Keshab bowed low before 










the Master and remained in that position a long time, touching the Master's feet with his 










forehead. Then he sat up. Sri Ramakrishna was still in a state of ecstasy. He muttered to himself. 










He talked to the Divine Mother. 



















Raising his voice, Keshab said: "I am here, sir. I am here." He took Sri Ramakrishna's left 










hand and stroked it gently. But the Master was in deep samadhi, completely intoxicated with 










divine love. A stream of words came from his lips as he talked to himself, and the devotees 










listened to him spellbound. 



















Brahman manifesting itself as the universe 



















MASTER: "As long as a man associates himself with upadhis, so long he sees the manifold, 










such as Keshab, Prasanna, Amrita, and so on; but on attaining Perfect Knowledge he sees only one 





































Consciousness everywhere. The same Perfect Knowledge, again, makes him realize that the one 










Consciousness has become the universe and its living beings and the twenty-four cosmic 










principles. But the manifestations of Divine Power are different in different beings. It is He, 










undoubtedly, who has become everything; but in some cases there is a greater manifestation than 










in others. 



















"Vidyasagar once asked me, 'Can it be true that God has endowed some with greater power 










and some with less?' I replied: 'If that were not so, how is it that one man may be stronger than 










fifty? If that were not the case, again, how is it that we have all come here to see you?' 



















"The soul through which God sports is endowed with His special power. The landlord may 










reside in any part of his estate, but he is generally to be found in a particular drawing-room. The 










devotee is God's drawing-room. God loves to sport in the heart of His devotee. It is there that His 










special power is manifest. 



















SIGNS OF A TRUE DEVOTEE 



















"What is the sign of such a devotee? When you see a man doing great works, you may know 










that God's special power is manifested through him. 



















IDENTITY OF BRAHMAN AND SAKTI 



















"The Primordial Power and the Supreme Brahman are identical. You can never think of the 










one without the other. They are like the gem and its brilliance. One cannot think of the brilliance 










without the gem, or of the gem without its brilliance. Again, it is like the snake and its wriggling 










motion. One cannot think of the wriggling motion without the snake, or of the snake without its 










wriggling motion. 



















"It is the Primordial Power that has become the universe and its living beings and the 










twenty-four cosmic principles. It is a case of involution and evolution. 



















MASTER S LOVE FOR PURE-SOULED DISCIPLES 



















"Why do I feel so restless for Rakhal , Narendra, and the other youngsters? Hazra once 










asked me, 'When will you think of God if you are always anxious about these boys?' (Keshab and 










the others smile.) That worried me greatly. I prayed to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, see what a fix I 










am in! Hazra scolds me because I worry about these young men.' Afterwards I asked Bholanath 










about it. He said to me that such a state of mind is described in the Mahabharata. How else will a 










man established in samadhi occupy his mind in the phenomenal world, after coming down from 










samadhi? That is why he seeks the company of devotees endowed with sattva. I gave a sigh of 










relief when Bholanath told me of the Mahabharata. 



















"Hazra is not to blame. During the period of struggle one should follow the method of 










discrimination-'Not this, not this'-and direct the whole mind to God. But the state of perfection is 










quite different. After reaching God one reaffirms what formerly one denied. To extract butter you 










must separate it from the buttermilk. Then you discover that butter and buttermilk are intrinsically 










related to one another. They belong to the same stuff. The butter is not essentially different from 





































the buttermilk, nor the buttermilk essentially different from the butter. After realizing God one 










knows definitely that it is He who has become everything. In some objects He is manifested more 










clearly, and in others less clearly. 



















"When a flood comes from the ocean, all the land is deep under water. Before the flood, 










the boat could have reached the ocean only by following the winding course of the river. But after 










the flood, one can row straight to the ocean. One need not take a roundabout course. After the 










harvest has been reaped, one need not take the roundabout course along the balk of the field. 










One can cross the field at any point. 



















"After the realization of God, He is seen in all beings. But His greater manifestation is in 










man. Again, among men, God manifests Himself more clearly in those devotees who are sattvic, in 










those who have no desire whatever to enjoy 'woman and gold'. Where can a man of samadhi rest 










his mind, after coming down from the plane of samadhi? That is why he feels the need of seeking 










the company of pure-hearted devotees, endowed with sattva and free from attachment to 










'woman and gold'. How else could such a person occupy himself in the relative plane of 










consciousness? 



















"He who is Brahman is the Adyasakti, the Primal Energy. When inactive He is called 










Brahman, the Purusha; He is called Sakti, or Prakriti, when engaged in creation, preservation, and 










destruction. These are the two aspects of Reality: Purusha and Prakriti. He who is the Purusha is 










also Prakriti. Both are the embodiment of Bliss. 



















"If you are aware of the Male Principle, you cannot ignore the Female Principle: He who is 










aware of the father must also think of the mother. (Keshab laughs) He who knows darkness also 










knows light. He who knows night also knows day. He who knows happiness also knows misery. 










You understand this, don't you?" 



















KESHAB: "Yes, sir. I do." 



















MASTER: "My Mother! Who is my Mother? Ah, She is the Mother of the Universe. It is She 










who creates and preserves the world, who always protects Her children, and who grants whatever 










they desire: dharma, artha, kama, moksha. A true son cannot live away from his mother. The 










Mother knows everything. The child only eats, drinks, and makes merry; he doesn't worry himself 










about the things of the world." 



















KESHAB: "Yes, sir. It is quite true." 



















While talking, Sri Ramakrishna regained the normal consciousness of the world. With a 










smile on his face he conversed with Keshab. The roomful of men watched them eagerly, and 










listened to their words. Everybody was amazed to find that neither Keshab nor the Master 










inquired about each other's health. They talked only of God. 



















MEDITATING ON GOD AND NOT ON HIS GLORIES 



















MASTER (to Keshab): "Why do the members of the Brahmo Samaj dwell so much on God's 










glories? Is there any great need of repeating such things as '0 God, Thou hast created the moon, 





































the sun, and the stars'? Most people are filled with admiration for the garden only. How few care 










to see its owner! Who is greater, the garden or its owner? 



















"After a few drinks at a tavern, do I care to Know how many gallons of wine are stored 










there? One bottle is enough for me. 



















"When I met Narendra, I never asked him 'Who is your father? How many houses does he 



















own?' 



















"Shall I tell you the truth? Man loves his own riches, and so he thinks that God loves His, 










too. He thinks that God will be pleased if we glorify His riches. Once Sambhu said to me, 'Please 










bless me, that I may die leaving my riches at the Lotus Feet of God.' I answered: 'These are riches 










only to you. What riches can you offer God? To Him these are mere dust and straw.' 



















"Once a thief broke into the temple of Vishnu and robbed the image of its jewels. Mathur 










Babu and I went to the temple to see what was the matter. Addressing the image, Mathur said 










bitterly: 'What a shame, Lord! You are so worthless! The thief took all the ornaments from Your 










body, and You couldn't do a thing about it.' Thereupon I said to Mathur: 'Shame on you! How 










improper your words are! To God, the jewels you talk so much about are only lumps of clay. 










Lakshmi, the Goddess of Fortune, is His Consort. Do you mean to say that He should spend 










sleepless nights because a thief has taken your few rupees? You mustn't say such things.' 



















"Can one ever bring God under control through wealth? He can be tamed only through love. 










What does He want? Certainly not wealth! He wants from His devotees love, devotion, feeling, 










discrimination, and renunciation. 



















DIFFERENT CLASSES WORSHIPPERS 



















"One looks on God exactly according to one's own inner feeling. Take, for instance, a 










devotee with an excess of tamas. He thinks that the Divine Mother eats goat. So he slaughters one 










for Her. Again, the devotee endowed with rajas cooks rice and various other dishes for the 










Mother. But the sattvic devotee doesn't make any outer show of his worship. People don't even 










know he is worshipping. If he has no flowers, he worships God with mere Ganges water and the 










leaves of the bel-tree. His food offering to the Deity consists of sweetened puffed rice or a few 










candies. Occasionally he cooks a little rice pudding for the Deity 



















"There is also another class of devotees, those who are beyond the three gunas. They have 










the nature of a child. Their worship consists in chanting God's name-just His name. 



















MEANING OF KESHAB S ILLNESS 



















(To Keshab, with a smile) "Why is it that you are ill? There is a reason for it. Many spiritual 










feelings have passed through your body; therefore it has fallen ill. At the time an emotion is 










aroused, one understands very little about it. The blow that it delivers to the body is felt only after 










a long while. I have seen big steamers going by on the Ganges, at the time hardly noticing their 










passing. But oh, my! What a terrific noise is heard after a while, when the waves splash against the 










banks! Perhaps a piece of the bank breaks loose and falls into the water. 





































"An elephant entering a hut creates havoc within and ultimately shakes it down. The 










elephant of divine emotion enters the hut of this body and shatters it to pieces. 



















"Do you know what actually happens? When a house is on fire, at first a few things inside 










burn. Then comes the great commotion. Just so, the fire of Knowledge at first destroys such 










enemies of spiritual life as passion, anger, and so forth. Then comes the turn of ego. And lastly a 










violent commotion is seen in the physical frame. 



















"You may think that everything is going to be over. But God will not release you as long as 










the slightest trace of your illness is left. You simply cannot leave the hospital if your name is 










registered there. As long as the illness is not perfectly cured, the doctor won't give you a permit to 










go. Why did you register your name in the hospital at all?" (All laugh.) 



















MASTER'S OWN ILLNESS 



















Keshab laughed again and again at the Master's allusion to the hospital. Then Sri 










Ramakrishna spoke of his own illness. (To Keshab) "Hriday used to say, 'Never before have I seen 










such ecstasy for God, and never before have I seen such illness.' I was then sriously ill with 










stubborn diarrhoea. It was as if millions of ants were gnawing at my brain. But all the same, 










spiritual talk went on day and night. Dr. Rama of Natagore was called in to see me. He found 










me discussing spiritual truth. 'What a madman!' he said. 'Nothing is left of him but a few bones, 










and still he is reasoning like that!' " 



















MASTER (to Keshab): "All depends on God's will. 



















Mother, all is done after Thine own sweet will; Thou art in truth self-willed, Redeemer of 










mankind ! Thou workest Thine own work; men only call it theirs. 



















"In order to take full advantage of the dew, the gardener removes the soil from the Basra 










rose down to the very root. The plant thrives better on account of the moisture. Perhaps that is 










why you too are being shaken to the very root. (Keshab and the Master laugh.) It may be that you 










will do tremendous things when you come back. 



















"Whenever I hear that you are ill I become extremely restless. After hearing of your last 










illness I, used to weep to the Divine Mother in the small hours of the morning. I prayed to Her, '0 










Mother, if anything happens to Keshab, with whom, then, shall I talk in Calcutta?' Coming to 










Calcutta, I offered fruits and sweets to the Divine Mother with a prayer for your well-being." 



















The devotees were deeply touched to hear of Sri Ramakrishna's love for Keshab and his 










longing for the Brahmo leader. 



















MASTER: "But this time, to tell the truth, I didn't feel anxious to that extent. Only for two or 










three days did I feel a little worried." 



















Keshab's venerable mother came to the east door of the room, the same door through 










which Keshab had entered. Umanath said aloud to the Master, "Sir, here is mother saluting you." 





































Sri Ramakrishna smiled. Umanath said again, "Mother asks you to bless Keshab that he may 










be cured of his illness." 



















MASTER (to Keshab's mother): "Please pray to the Divine Mother, who is the Bestower of all 










bliss. She will take away your troubles. 



















(To keshab) "Don't spend long hours in the inner apartments. You will sink down and down 










in the company of women. You will feel better if you hear only talk of God." 



















The Master uttered these words in a serious voice and then began to laugh like a boy. He 










said to Keshab, "Let me see your hand." He weighed it playfully, like a child. At last he said: "No, 










your hand is light. Hypocrites have heavy hands. "(All laugh.) . 



















Umanath again said to the Master from the door. "Mother asks you to bless Keshab." 



















MASTER (gravely): "What can I do? God alone, blesses all. 'Thou workest Thine, own work; 










men only call it theirs.' 



















"God laughs on two occasions. He laughs when two brothers divide land between them. 










They put a string across the land and say to each other, 'This side is mine, and that side is yours. 










God laughs and says to Himself, 'Why, this whole universe is Mine; and about a little clod they 










say, "This side is mine, and that side is yours"!' 



















"God laughs again when the physician says to the mother weeping bitterly because of her 










child's desperate illness: 'Don't be afraid, mother. I shall cure your child.' The physician does not 










know that no one can save the child if God wills that he should die." (All are silent.) 



















Just then Keshab was seized with a fit of coughing, which lasted for a long time. The sight of 










his suffering made everyone, sad. He became exhausted and could stay no longer. He bowed low 










before the Master and left the room, holding to the wall as before. 



















Some refreshments had been arranged for the Master. Keshab's eldest son was seated near 










him. Amrita introduced the boy and requested Sri Ramakrishna to bless him. The Master said, "It is 










not given to me to bless anyone." With a sweet smile he stroked the boy's body gently. 



















AMRITA (with a smile): "All right, then do as you please." 



















MASTER (to the devotees): " I cannot say such a thing as 'May you be healed.' I never ask 










the Divine Mother to give me the power of healing. I pray to Her only for pure love. 



















MASTER PRAISES KESHAB 



















"Is Keshab a small person? He is respected by all, seekers after wealth as well as holy men. 










Once I visited Dayananda, who was then staying at a garden house. I saw he was extremely 










anxious about Keshab's coming; he went out every few minutes to see whether he had arrived. I 










learnt later on that Keshab had made an appointment with him that day. Keshab, I understood, 










had no faith in the sacrifices and the deities mentioned in the Vedas. Referring to this, Dayananda 










said: 'Why, the Lord has created so many things. Could He not make deities as well?' " 





































Continuing, the Master said: "Keshab is free from the pride of a small minded religious 










teacher. To many people he has said, 'If you have any doubts, go there2 to have them solved.' It is 










my way, too, to say: 'What shall I do with people's respect? Let Keshab's virtues increase a 










millionfold.' Keshab is certainly a great man. Everyone respects him, seekers after wealth as well as 










holy men." Thus did Sri Ramakrishna praise Keshab before the latter's disciples. 



















After partaking of the refreshments the Master was ready to leave. The Brahmo devotees 










accompanied him to the cab, which was standing in the street. While coming down the stairs the 










Master noticed that there was no light on the ground floor. He said to Amrita and Keshab's other 










disciples: "These places should be well lighted. A house without light becomes stricken with 










poverty. Please see that it doesn't happen again." 



















Then Sri Ramakrishna left for Dakshineswar with one or two devotees. 



















On his way to Dakshineswar from Keshab's cottage Sri Ramakrishna stopped at Jaygopal 










Sen's house. It was about seven o'clock in the evening. 



















In the drawing-room, Jaygopal's relatives and neighbours had gathered. Vaikuntha, 










Jaygopal's brother, said to the Master: "Sir, we are worldly people. Please give us some advice." 



















ADVICE TO THE WORLDLY-MINDED 



















MASTER: "Do your duty to the world after knowing God. With one hand hold to the Lotus 










Feet of the Lord and with the other do your work." 



















VAIKUNTHA: "Is the world unreal?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, it is unreal as long as one has not realized God. Through ignorance man 










forgets God and speaks always of T and 'mine'. He sinks down and down, entangled in maya, 










deluded by 'woman and gold'. Maya robs him of his knowledge to such an extent that he cannot 










find the way of escape, though such a way exists. 



















"Listen to a song: 



















When such delusion veils the world, through Mahamaya's spell, That Brahma is bereft of 










sense And Vishnu loses consciousness, What hope is left for men? . . 



















"You all know from your experience how impermanent the world is. Look at it this way. 










How many people have come into the world and again passed away! People are born and they die. 










This moment the world is and the next it is not. It is impermanent. Those you think to be your very 










own will not exist for you when you close your eyes in death. Again, you see people who have no 










immediate relatives, and yet for the sake of a grandson they will not go to Benares to lead a holy 










life. 'Oh, what will become of my Haru then?' they argue. 



















The narrow channel first is made, and there the trap is set; But open though the passage 



















lies, 



















The fish, once safely through the gate, Do not come out again. 





































Yet even though a way leads forth, Encased within its own cocoon, The worm remains to 



















die. 



















This kind of world is illusory and impermanent." 



















A NEIGHBOUR: "Why, sir, should one hold to God with one hand and to the world with the 










other? Why should one even stretch out one hand to hold to the world, if it is impermanent?" 



















MASTER: "The world is not impermanent if one lives there after knowing God. Listen to 










another song: 



















mind, you do not know how to farm! Fallow lies the field of your life. If you had only 










worked it well, How rich a harvest you might reap! Hedge it about with Kali's name If you would 










keep your harvest safe; This is the stoutest hedge of all, For Death himself cannot come near it. 



















. "Did you listen to the song? Hedge it about with Kali's name If you would keep your harvest 










safe. Surrender yourself to God and you will achieve everything. This is the stoutest hedge of all, 










For Death himself cannot come near it. 



















IDEAL HOUSEHOLDER'S LIFE 



















"Yes, it is a strong hedge indeed. If you but, realize God, you won't see the world as 










unsubstantial. He who has realized God knows that God Himself has become the world and all 










living beings. When you feed your child, you should feel that you are feeding God. You should look 










on your father and mother as veritable manifestations of God and the Divine Mother, and serve 










them as such. If a man enters the world after realizing God, he does not generally keep up physical 










relations with his wife. Both of them are devotees; they love to talk only of God and pass their 










time in spiritual conversation. They serve other devotees of God, for they know that God alone has 










become all living beings; and, knowing this, they devote their lives to the service of others." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "But, sir, such a husband and wife are not to be found anywhere." 



















MASTER: "Yes, they can be found, though they may be very rare. Worldly people cannot 










recognize them. In order to lead such a life both husband and wife must be spiritual. It is possible 










to lead such a life if both of them have tasted the Bliss of God. God's special grace is necessary to 










create such a couple; otherwise there will always be misunderstanding between them. In that case 










the one has to leave the other. Life becomes very miserable if husband and wife do not agree. The 










wife will say to her husband day and night: 'Why did my father marry me to such a person? I can't 










get enough to eat or to feed my children. I haven't clothes enough to cover my body or to give to 










my children. I haven't received a single piece of jewelry from you. How happy you have made me! 










Ah! You keep your eyes closed and mutter the name of God! Now do give up all these crazy ideas.' 



















ii 



















DEVOTEE: "There are such obstacles, certainly. Besides, the children may be disobedient. 










There is no end of difficulties. Now, sir, what is the way?" 





































Solitude and holy company 





































MASTER: "It is extremely difficult to practise spiritual discipline and at the same time lead a 










householder's life. There are many handicaps: disease, grief, poverty, misunderstanding with one's 










wife, and disobedient, stupid, and stubborn children. I don't have to give you a list of them. 



















"But still there is a way out. One should pray to God, going now and then into solitude, and 










make efforts to realize Him." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Must one leave home then?" 



















MASTER: "No, not altogether. Whenever you have leisure, go into solitude for a day or two. 










At that time don't have any relations with the outside world and don't hold any conversation with 










worldly people on worldly affairs. You must live either in solitude or in the company of holy men." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "How can one recognize a holy man?" 



















MASTER: "He who has surrendered his body, mind, and innermost self to God is surely a 










holy man. He who has renounced 'woman and gold' is surely a holy man. He is a holy man who 










does not regard woman with the eyes of a worldly person. He never forgets to look upon a woman 










as his mother, and to offer her his worship if he happens to be near her. The holy man constantly 










thinks of God and does not indulge in any talk except about spiritual things. Furthermore, he 










serves all beings, knowing that God resides in everybody's heart. These, in general, are the signs of 










a holy man." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Must one always live in solitude?" 



















MASTER: "Haven't you seen the trees on the foot-path along a street? They are fenced 










around as long as they are very young; otherwise cattle destroy them. But there is no longer any 










need of fences when their trunks grow thick and strong. Then they won't break even if an elephant 










is tied to them. Just so, there will be no need for you to worry and fear if you make your mind as 










strong as a thick tree-trunk. First of all try to acquire discrimination. Break the jack-fruit open only 










after you have rubbed your hands with oil; then its sticky milk won't smear them." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "What is discrimination?" 



















MASTER: "Discrimination is the reasoning by which one knows that God alone is real and all 










else is unreal. Real means eternal, and unreal means impermanent. He who has acquired 










discrimination knows that God is the only Substance and all else is nonexistent. With the 










awakening of this spirit of discrimination a man wants to know God. On the contrary, if a man 










loves the unreal-such things as creature comforts, name, fame, and wealth, then he doesn't want 










to know God, who is of the very nature of Reality. Through discrimination between the Real and 










the unreal one seeks to know God. 



















"Listen to a song: 



















Come, let us go for a walk, mind, to Kali, the Wish-fulfilling Tree, And there beneath It 










gather the four fruits of life. Of your two wives, Dispassion and Worldliness, Bring along Dispassion 










only, on your way to the Tree, And ask her son Discrimination about the Truth. . . . 





































"By turning the mind within oneself one acquires discrimination, and through discrimination 










one thinks of Truth. Then the mind feels the desire to go for a walk to Kali, the Wish-fulfilling Tree. 










Reaching that Tree, that is to say, going near to God, you can without any effort gather four fruits, 










namely, dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. Yes, after realizing God, one can also get, if one so 










desires, dharma, artha, and kama, which are necessary for leading the worldly life." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Then why should one call the world maya?" 



















GOD AND THE WORLD 



















MASTER: "As long as one has not realized God, one should renounce the world, following 










the process of 'Neti, neti.' But he who has attained God knows that it is God who has become all 










this. Then he sees that God, maya, living beings, and the universe form one whole. God includes 










the universe and its living beings. Suppose you have separated the shell, flesh, and seeds of a 










bel-fruit and someone asks you the weight of the fruit. Will you leave aside the shell and the seeds, 










and weigh only the flesh? Not at all. To know the real weight of the fruit, you must weigh the 










whole of it-the shell, the flesh, and the seeds. Only then can you tell its real weight. The shell may 










be likened to the universe, and the seeds to living beings. While one is engaged in discrimination 










one says to oneself that the universe and the living beings are non-Self and unsubstantial. At that 










time one thinks of the flesh alone as the substance, and the shell and seeds as unsubstantial. But 










after discrimination is over, one feels that all three parts of the fruit together form a unity. Then 










one further realizes that the stuff that has produced the flesh of the fruit has also produced the 










shell and seeds. To know the real nature of the bel-fruit one must know all three. 



















"It is the process of evolution and involution. The world, after its dissolution, remains 










involved in God; and God, at the time of creation, evolves as the world. Butter goes with 










buttermilk, and buttermilk goes with butter. If there is a thing called buttermilk, then butter also 










exists; and if there is a thing called butter, then buttermilk also exists. If the Self exists, then the 










non-Self must also exist. 



















"The phenomenal world belongs to that very Reality to which the Absolute belongs; again, 










the Absolute belongs to that very Reality to which the phenomenal world belongs. He who is 










realized as God has also become the universe and its living beings. One who knows the Truth 










knows that it is He alone who has become father and mother, child and neighbour, man and 










animal, good and bad, holy and unholy, and so forth." 



















VIRTUE AND VICE 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Then is there no virtue and no sin?" 



















MASTER: "They both exist and do not exist. If God keeps the ego in a man, then He keeps in 










him the sense of differentiation and also the sense of virtue and sin. But in a rare few He 










completely effaces the ego and these go beyond virtue and sin, good and bad. As long as a man 










has not realized God, he retains the sense of differentiation and the knowledge of good and bad. 










You may say: 'Virtue and sin are the same to me. I am doing only as God bids me.' But you know in 










your heart of hearts that those are mere words. No sooner do you commit an evil deed than you 





































feel a palpitation in your heart. Even after God has been realized, He keeps in the mind of the 










devotee, if He so desires, the feeling of the 'servant ego'. In that state the devotee says, '0 God, 










Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.' Such a devotee enjoys only spiritual talk and spiritual 










deeds. He does not enjoy the company of ungodly people. He does not care for any work that is 










not of a holy nature. So you see that God keeps the sense of differentiation even in such a 










devotee." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "You ask us, sir, to live in the world after knowing God. Can God really be 










known?" 



















MASTER: "God cannot be known by the sense-organs or by this mind; but He can be known 










by the pure mind, the mind that is free from worldiy desires." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Who can know God?" 



















MASTER: "Right. Who can really know Him? But as for us, it is enough to know as much of 










Him as we need. What need have I of a whole well of water? One jar is more than enough for me. 










An ant went to a sugar hill. Did it need the entire hill? A grain or two of sugar was more than 










enough." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "Sir, we are like typhoid patients. How can we be satisfied with one jar of 










water? We feel like knowing, the whole of God." 



















MASTER: "That's true. But there is also medicine for typhoid." 



















NEIGHBOUR: "What is that medicine, sir?" 



















MASTER: "The company of holy men, repeating the name of God and singing His glories, 










and unceasing prayer. I prayed to the Divine Mother: 'Mother, I don't seek knowledge. Here, take 










Thy knowledge, take Thy ignorance. Give me only pure love for Thy Lotus Feet.' I didn't ask for 










anything else. 



















"As is the disease, so must the remedy be. The Lord says in the Gita: '0 Arjuna, take refuge 










in Me. I shall deliver you from all sins.' Take shelter at His feet: He will give you right 










understanding. He will take entire responsibility for you. Then you will get rid of the typhoid. Can 










one ever know God with such a mind as this? Can one pour four seers of milk into a one-seer pot? 










Can we ever know God unless He lets us know Him? Therefore I say, take shelter in God. Let Him 










do whatever He likes. He is self-willed. What power is there in a man?" 



















WITH THE DEVOTEES AT DAKSHINESWAR (II) 



















Sunday, December 9, 1883 



















Chaitanya's exalted state 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was seated on the small couch in his room with Adhar, Manomohan, 










Rakhal , M., Harish, and other devotees. It was about two o' clock in the afternoon. The Master 










was describing to them the exalted state of Sri Chaitanya. 





































MASTER: "Chaitanya experienced three states of mind. First, the conscious state, when his 










mind dwelt on the gross and the subtle. Second, the semi-conscious state, when his mind entered 










the causal body and was absorbed in the bliss of divine intoxication. Third, the inmost state, when 










his mind was merged in the Great Cause. 



















This agrees very well with the five koshas, or 'sheaths', described in the Vedanta. The gross 










body corresponds to the annamayakosha and the pranamayakosha, the subtle body to the 










manomayakosha and the vijnanamayakosha, and the causal body to the Anandamayakosha. The 










Mahakarana, the Great Cause, is beyond the five sheaths. When Chaitanya's mind merged in That, 










he would go into samadhi. This is called the nirvikalpa or jada samadhi. 



















"While conscious of the outer world, Chaitanya sang the name of God; while in the state of 










partial consciousness, he danced with the devotees; and while in the inmost state of 










consciousness, he remained absorbed in samadhi." 



















M. (to himself): "Is the Master hinting at the different states of his own mind? There is 










much similarity between Chaitanya and the Master." 



















MASTER: "Chaitanya was Divine Love incarnate. He came down to earth to teach people 










how to love God. One achieves everything when one loves God. There is no need of hathayoga." 



















PRACTICE OF HATHAYOGA 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is hathayoga like?" 



















MASTER: "A man practising hathayoga dwells a great deal on his body. He washes his 










intestines by means of a bamboo tube through his anus. He draws ghee and milk through his 










sexual organ. He learns how to manipulate his tongue by performing exercises. He sits in a fixed 










posture and bow and then levitates. All these are actions of prana. A magician was performing his 










feats when his tongue turned up and clove to the roof of his mouth. Immediately his body became 










motionless. People thought he was dead. He was buried and remained many years in the 










grave. After a long time the grave somehow broke open. Suddenly the man regained 










consciousness of the world and cried out, 'Come delusion! Come confusion!' (All laugh.) All these 










are actions of prana. 



















"The Vedantists do not accept hathayoga. There is also rajayoga. Rajayoga describes how to 










achieve union with God through the mind by means of discrimination and bhakti. This yoga is 










good. Hathayoga is not good. The life of a man in the Kaliyuga is dependent on food." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was standing in the road by the side of the nahabat. He was on his way to 










his room, having come from the pine-grove. He saw M. seated on the verandah of the nahabat, 










behind the fence, absorbed in meditation. 



















MASTER: "Hello! You are here? You will get results very soon. If you practise a little, then 










someone will come forward to help you." 



















M. looked up at the Master, startled; he remained sitting on the floor. 





































MASTER: "The time is ripe for you. The mother bird does not break the shell of the egg until 










the right time arrives. What I told you is indeed your Ideal." 



















Sri Ramakrishna again mentioned to M. his spiritual Ideal. 



















MASTER: "It is not necessary for all to practise great austerity. But I went through great 










suffering. I used to lie on the ground with my head resting on a mound for a pillow. I hardly 










noticed the passing of the days. I only called on God and wept, '0 Mother! Mother!'" 



















M. had been visiting Sri Ramakrishna for the past two years. Since he had been educated 










along English lines, he had acquired a fondness for Western philosophy and science, and had liked 










to hear Keshab and other scholars lecture. Sri Ramakrishna would address him now and then as 










the "English-man". Since coming to Sri Ramakrishna, M. had lost all relish for lectures and for 










books written by English scholars. The only thing that appealed to him now was to see the Master 










day and night, and hear the words that fell from his blessed lips. M. constantly dwelt on certain of 










Sri Ramakrishna's sayings. The Master had said, "One can certainly see God through the practice of 










spiritual discipline", and again, "The vision of God is the only goal of human life." 



















MASTER (to M.): "If you practise only a little, someone will come forward to tell you the 










right path. Observe the ekadasi. 



















Master's intimate relationship with disciples 



















"You are my very own, my relative; otherwise, why should you come here so frequently? 










While listening to the kirtan, I had a vision of Rakhal in the midst of Sri Krishna's companions in 










Vrindavan. Narendra belongs to a very high level. Hirananda too; how childlike his nature is! What 










sweet disposition he has! I want to see him too. 



















"Once I saw the companions of Chaitanya, not in a trance but with these very eyes. 










Formerly I was in such an exalted state of mind that I could see all these things with my naked 










eyes; but now I see them in samadhi. I saw the companions of Chaitanya with these naked eyes. I 










think I saw you there, and Balaram too, You must have noticed that when I see certain people I 










jump up with a start. Do you know why? A man feels that way when he sees his own people after a 










long time. 



















"I used to pray to the Mother, crying: 'Mother, if I do not find the devotees I'll surely die. 










Please bring them to me immediately.' In those days whatever desire arose in my mind would 










come to pass. I planted a tulsi-grove in the Panchavati in order to practise japa and meditation. I 










wanted very much to fence it around with bamboo sticks. Soon afterwards a bundle of bamboo 










sticks and some string were carried by the flood-tide of the Ganges right in front of the Panchavati. 










A temple servant noticed them and joyfully told me. 



















"In that state of divine exaltation I could no longer perform the formal worship. 'Mother,' I 










said, 'who will look after me? I haven't the power to take care of myself. I want to listen only to 










talk about Thee. I want to feed Thy devotees. I want to give a little help to those whom I chance to 










meet. How will all that be possible, Mother? Give me a rich man to stand by me.' That is why 










Mathur Babu did so much to serve me. 





































"I said further, 'Certainly I shall not have any children, Mother. But it is my desire that a boy 










with sincere love for God should always remain with me. Give me such a boy.' That is the reason 










Rakhal came here. Those whom I think of as my own are part and parcel of me." 



















The Master started again for the Panchavati accompanied by M. No one else was with 










them. Sri Ramakrishna with a smile narrated to him various incidents of the past years of his life. 



















MASTER: "You see, one day I saw a strange figure covering the whole space from the Kali 










temple to the Panchavati. Do you believe this?" 



















M. remained silent with wonder. He plucked one or two leaves from a branch in the 










Panchavati and put them in his pocket. 



















MASTER: "See there-that branch has been broken. I used to sit under it." 



















M: "I took a young twig from that tree-l have it at home." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Why?" 



















M: "I feel happy when I look at it. After all this is over, this place will be considered very 



















holy." 



















MASTER (smiling): "What kind of holy place? Like Panihati?" 



















Almost every year, for some time past, the Master had been attending the religious festival 










at Panihati. 



















It was evening. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch in his room, absorbed in 










meditation on the Divine Mother. The evening worship in the temples began, with the music of 










gong and conch-shell. M. was going to spend the night with the Master. 



















Ater a time Sri Ramakrishna asked M. to read from the Bhaktamala, a book about the 










Vaishnava saints. 



















STORY OF A VAISHNAVA DEVOTEE 



















M. read: "There was a king named Jayamal who loved Krishna with all his heart. He followed 










with unfailing devotion all the rites and ceremonies associated with the adoration of Krishna, 










whom he worshipped under the name of Syamalasundara. Completely satisfied with his own Ideal 










Deity, he never directed his attention to any other god or goddess. One of the inflexible rules of his 










devotions was to worship the Deity daily till almost midday. He would never deviate from this 










practice, even at the risk of his wealth or his kingdom. Learning this secret, an enemy king invaded 










the kingdom during the morning hours. Jayamal's soldiers could not fight without his command; so 










they watched the invasion silently. Slowly the enemy surrounded the moat of the capital; yet 










Jayamal did not come out of his shrine room. His mother came to him and wept bitterly, trying to 










persuade the king to fight. He said to her calmly: "Why are you worried? Syamalasundara gave me 










this kingdom. What can I do if He has decided to take it away? On the other hand, none will be 










able to do me harm if He protects me. Our own efforts are vain!" 





































And actually, in the mean time, Syamalasundara, the Deity Himself, had taken the king's 










horse from the stable and had ridden fully armed to the field. Alone He faced the hostile king and 










alone destroyed his army. Having crushed the enemy forces, the Deity returned to the temple and 










fastened the horse near by. 



















Jayamal, on completing his worship, came out and discovered the horse there, panting and 










covered with sweat. "Who has been riding my horse?" he demanded. "Who brought it to the 










temple?" The officers declared they knew nothing about it. In a pensive mood the king proceeded 










to the battle-field with his army and there found the enemy, with the exception of their leader, 










lying dead. He was staring uncomprehendingly at the scene, when the enemy king approached, 










worshipped him, and said: "Please permit me to tell you something. How could I fight? You have a 










warrior who could conquer the entire world. I do not want your wealth or your kingdom; indeed, I 










will gladly give you my own, if you will tell me about that Blue Warrior, your friend. No sooner did I 










turn my eyes on him than he cast a spell on my heart and soul." 



















Jayamal then realized it had been none other than Syamalasundara that had appeared on 










the battle-field. The enemy king understood too. He worshipped Jayamal and through his blessings 










received Krishna's grace. 



















MASTER: "Do you believe all that? Do you believe Krishna rode on that horse and killed 










Jayamal's enemies?" 



















M: "I believe that Jayamal, Krishna's devotee, prayed to Him with a yearning heart. But I 










don't know whether the enemy really saw Him coming to the battle-field on a horse. Krishna might 










have come there riding the horse, but I do not know whether they really saw Him." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "The book contains nice stories about devotees. But it is one-sided. 










Also, it abuses those who differ with its views." 



















The following morning the Master and M. were talking in the garden. 



















M: "Then I shall stay here." 



















MASTER: "Well, you all come here so often. What does it mean? People visit a holyman 










once at the most. But you all come here so often. What is the significance of that?" 



















M. remained silent. The Master himself gave the reply. 



















MASTER: "Could you come here unless you belonged to my inner circle? That means you all 










are my own relatives, my own people-like father and son, brother and sister. 



















"I do not tell you everything. If I did, would you come here any more? 



















"Once Sukadeva went to Janaka to be instructed in the Knowledge of Brahman; Janaka said, 










'First give me my fee.' 'But', said Sukadeva, 'why should I give you the fee before receiving the 










instruction?' Janaka laughed and said: 'Will you be conscious of guru and disciple after attaining 










Brahmajnana? That is why I asked you to give me the fee first.' " 





































It was night. The moon rose, flooding all the quarters with its silvery light. M. was walking 










alone in the garden of the temple. On one side of the path stood the Panchavati, the bakul-grove, 










the nahabat, and the Master's room, and on the other side flowed the Ganges, reflecting millions 










of broken moons on its rippling surface. 



















M. said to himself: "Can one really see God? The Master says it is possible. He says that, if 










one makes a little effort, then someone comes forward and shows the way. Well, I am married. I 










have children. Can one realize God in spite of all that?" 



















M. reflected awhile and continued his soliloquy: "Surely one can. Otherwise, why should the 










Master say so? Why shouldn't it be possible through the grace of God? 



















"Here is the world around me-the sun, moon, stars, living beings, and the twenty-four 










cosmic principles. How did they come into existence? Who is their Creator? What am I to Him? Life 










is indeed vain without this knowledge. 



















"Sri Ramakrishna is certainly the best of men. In all my life I have not seen another great 










soul like him. He must have seen God. Otherwise, how could he talk with God day and night, 










addressing Him so intimately as 'Mother'? Otherwise, how could he love God so intimately? Such is 










his love for God that he forgets the outer world. He goes into samadhi and remains like a lifeless 










thing. Again, in the ecstasy of that love, he laughs and cries and dances and sings." 



















Friday, December 14, 1883 



















At nine o'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna was standing on the southeast verandah 










near the door of his room, with Ramlal by his side. Rakhal and Latu were moving about. M. arrived 










and prostrated himself before the Master. Sri Ramakrishna said to him affectionately: "You have 










come. That's very good. Today is an auspicious day." 



















It was the last day of the Bengali month and the day of the full moon. M. was going to 










spend a few days with the Master practising spiritual discipline. The Master had said to him, "If an 










aspirant practises a little spiritual discipline, then someone comes forward to help him." 



















The Master had said to M: "You should not eat every day at the guesthouse of the Kali 










temple. The guest-house is intended to supply free food to monks and the destitute. Bring your 










own cook with you." M. had accordingly done so. The Master arranged a place for the man to cook 










and he asked Ramlal to speak to the milkman about milk. 



















A little later Ramlal began to read from the Adhyatma Ramayana. The Master and M. 










listened while he read: 



















Rama had married Sita after breaking the great bow of Siva. On the way to Ayhodhya with 










His bride, Rama was confronted by the warrior sage Parasurama, who was about to make trouble 










for Him. Parasurama threw a bow at Rama and challenged Him to string it. Dasaratha, Rama's 










father, was seized with fear. With a smile, Rama took the bow in His left hand and strung it. Then 










twanging the bow-string, He fixed an arrow and asked Parasurama where to shoot it. That curbed 










the pride of the warrior sage. Prostrating himself before Rama, Parasurama worshipped Him as the 










Supreme Brahman. 





































As Sri Ramakrishna listened to Parasurama's hymn, he went into a spiritual mood and now 










and then chanted the name of Rama in his melodious voice. 



















Then the Master asked Ramlal to read about Guhaka. Ramlal read: 



















Guhaka, the pariah, was chief of the untouchables and an intimate friend of Rama. When 










Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana were starting into the forest to redeem Dasaratha's pledge, Guhaka 










ferried them across the river. Rama embraced Guhaka tenderly and told him He was going to 










spend fourteen years in exile, wearing the bark of trees and eating herbs, fruits, and roots that 










grew in the woods. He promised to visit Guhaka again on His way back to Ayhodhya after the 










period of exile was over. The pariah king waited patiently. But when the fourteenth year had run 










out and Rama had not returned, Guhaka lighted a funeral pyre. He was on the point of entering it 










when Hanuman arrived as Rama's messenger. In a celestial chariot Rama and Sita soon appeared, 










and Guhaka's joy was unbounded. 



















After the midday meal Sri Ramakrishna lay down on his bed to rest. M. was seated on the 










floor. Presently Dr. Shyama and a few devotees arrived. The Master sat up on the bed and began 










to converse with them. 



















WORK AND WORSHIP 



















MASTER: "It is by no means necessary for a man always to be engaged in his duties. Actions 










drop away when one realizes, God, as the flower drops of itself when the fruit appears. 



















"He who has realized God no longer performs religious duties such as the sandhya. In his 










case the sandhya merges in the Gayatri. When that happens, it is enough for a person to repeat 










just the Gayatri mantra. Then the Gayatri merges in Om. After that one no longer chants even the 










Gayatri; it is enough then to chant simply Om. How long should a man practise such devotions as 










the sandhya? As long as he does not feel a thrill in his body and shed tears of joy while repeating 










the name of Rama or of Hari. People worship God to win money or a lawsuit. That is not good." 



















A DEVOTEE: "We find that everyone strives after money. Even Keshab Sen married his 










daughter to a prince." 



















MASTER: "Keshab's case is quite different. God provides everything for a genuine devotee, 










even without his making any effort. The son of a real king gets his monthly allowance. I am not 










talking of lawyers and men of that sort, who go through suffering in order to earn money, and who 










become slaves of others to that end. I am speaking of a real prince. A true devotee has no desire. 










He does not care for money. Money comes to him of itself. The Gita describes such a devotee as 










'content with what comes to him without effort'. A good brahmin, without any personal motive, 










can accept food even from the house of an untouchable. He does not desire it; it comes of its own 










accord." 



















HOW TO LIVE IN THE WORLD 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, how should one live in the world?" 





































MASTER: "Live in the world as the mud fish lives in the mud. One develops love of God by 










going away from the world into solitude, now and then, and meditating on God. After that one can 










live in the world unattached. The mud is there, and the fish has to live in it, but its body is not 










stained by the mud. Such a man can lead the life of a householder in a spirit of detachment" 



















The Master noticed that M. was listening to his words with great attention. 



















MASTER (looking at M.): "One can realize God if one feels intense dispassion for worldly 










things. A man with such dispassion feels that the world is like a forest on fire. He regards his wife 










and children as a deep well. If he really feels that kind of dispassion, he renounces home and 










family. It is not enough for him to live in the world in a spirit of detachment. 



















'"Woman and gold' alone is maya. If maya is once recognized, it feels ashamed of itself and 










takes to flight. A man put on a tiger skin and tried to frighten another man. But the latter said: 'Ah! 










I have recognized you! You are our Hare.' At that the man dressed in the skin went away smiling to 










frighten someone else. 



















WOMEN AS EMBODIMENTS OF THE DIVINE MOTHER 



















"All women are the embodiments of Sakti. It is the Primal Power that has become women 










and appears to us in the form of women. It is said in the Adhyatma Ramayana that Narada and 










others praised Rama, saying: '0 Rama, Thou alone art all that we see as male, and Sita, all that we 










see as female. Thou art Indra, and Sita is Indrani; Thou art Siva and Sita is Sivani; Thou art man, and 










Sita is woman. What more need I say? Thou alone dost exist wherever there is a male, and Sita 










wherever there is a female.' 



















(To the devotees) "One cannot renounce by the mere wish. There are prarabdha 










karma-inherited tendencies-and the like. Once a yogi said to a king, 'Live with me in the forest and 










think of God.' The king replied: 'That I cannot very well do. I could live with you, but I still have the 










desire for enjoyment. If I live in this forest, perhaps I shall create a kingdom even here. I still have 










desires.' 



















"Natabar Panja used to look after his cows in this garden during his boyhood. He had many 










desires. Hence he has established a castor-oil factory and earned a great deal of money. He has a 










prosperous castor-oil business at Alambazar. 



















"There is one sect that prescribes spiritual discipline in company with women. I was once 










taken to the women belonging to the Kartabhaja sect. They all sat around me. I addressed them as 










'mother'. At that they whispered among themselves: 'He is still a pravartaka. He doesn't know the 










way.' According to that sect the pravartaka is the beginner. Then comes the sadhaka, the 










struggling aspirant, and last of all the siddha of the siddha, the supremely perfect. A woman 










walked over to Vaishnavcharan and sat near him. Asked about it, he answered, 'She feels just like a 










young girl.' One quickly strays from the religious path by looking on woman as wife: But to regard 










her as mother is a pure attitude." 



















Some of the devotees took leave of the Master, saying that they were going to visit the 










temple of Kali and several of the other temples. 





































M. went walking alone in the Panchavati and other places in the temple garden. He thought 










about the Master's assurance that God can be easily realized, and about his exhortation to lead a 










life of intense renunciation, and his saying that maya, when recognized, takes to flight. 



















IMAGE WORSHIP 



















At half past three in the afternoon M. again entered the Master's room and sat on the floor. 










A teacher from the Broughton Institution had come with several students to pay a visit to Sri 










Ramakrishna. They were conversing together. Now and then the teacher asked questions. The 










conversation was about the worship of images. 



















MASTER (to the teacher): "What is wrong with image worship? The Vedanta says that 










Brahman manifests Itself where there is 'Existence, Light, and Love'. Therefore nothing exists but 










Brahman. 



















"How long do small girls play with their dolls? As long as they are not married and do not 










live with their husbands. After marriage they put the dolls away in a box. What further need is 










there of worshipping the image after the vision of God?" 



















GOD-VISION THROUGH YEARNING 



















The Master glanced at M. and said: "One attains God when one feels yearning for Him. An 










intense restlessness is needed. Through it the whole mind goes to God. 



















"A man had a daughter who became a widow when she was very young. She had never 










known her husband: She noticed the husbands of other girls and said one day to her father, 










'Where is my husband?' The father replied: 'Govinda is your husband. He will come to you if you 










call Him.' At these words the girl went to her room, closed the door, and cried to Govinda, saying: 










'0 Govinda, corne to me! Show Yourself to me! Why don't You come?' God could not resist the 










girl's piteous cry and appeared before her. 



















"One must have childlike faith-and the intense yearning that a child feels to see its mother. 










That yearning is like the red sky in the east at dawn. After such a sky the sun must rise. 










Immediately after that yearning one sees God. 



















"Let me tell you the story of a boy named Jatila. He used to walk to school through the 










woods, and the journey frightened him; One day he told his mother of his fear. She replied: 'Why 










should you be afraid? Call Madhusudana.' 'Mother,' asked the boy, 'who is Madhusudana?' The 










mother said, 'He is your Elder Brother.' One day after this, when the boy again felt afraid in the 










woods, he cried out, '0 Brother Madhusudana!' But there was no response. He began to weep 










aloud: 'Where are You, Brother Madhusudana? Come to me. I am afraid.' Then God could no 










longer stay away. He appeared before the boy and said: 'Here I am. Why are you frightened?' And 










so, saying He took the boy out of the woods and showed him the way to school. When He took 










leave of the boy, God said: 'I will come whenever you call Me. Do not be afraid.' One must have 










this faith of a child, this yearning. 





































"A brahmin used to worship his Family Deity daily with food offerings. One day he had to go 










away on business. As he was about to leave the house, he said to his young son: 'Give the offering 










to the Deity today. See that God is fed.' The boy offered food in the shrine, but the image 










remained silent on the altar. It would neither talk nor eat. The boy waited a long time, but still the 










image did not move. But the boy firmly believed that God would come down from His throne, sit 










on the floor, and partake of the food. Again and again he prayed to the Deity, saying: '0 Lord, 










come down and eat the food. It is already very late. I cannot sit here any longer.' But the image did 










not utter a word. The boy burst into tears and cried: '0 Lord, my father asked me to feed You. 










Why won't You come down? Why won't You eat from my hands?' The boy wept for some time 










with a longing soul. At last the Deity, smiling, came down from the altar and sat before the meal 










and ate it. After feeding the Deity, the boy came out of the shrine room. His relatives said: 'The 










worship is over. Now bring away the offering.' 'Yes,' said the boy, 'the worship is over. But God has 










eaten everything.' 'How is that?' asked the relatives. The boy replied innocently, 'Why, God has 










eaten the food.' They entered the shrine and were speechless with wonder to see that the Deity 










had really eaten every bit of the offering." 



















Late in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was talking to M. They were standing on the south 










side of the nahabat. Since it was winter the Master was wrapped in his woolen shawl. 



















MASTER: "Where will you sleep? In the hut in the Panchavati?" 



















"Won't they let me have the room on the upper floor of the nahabat?" 



















selected the nahabat because he had a poetic temperament. From there he could see the 










sky, the Ganges, the moonlight, and the flowers in the garden. 



















MASTER: "Oh, they'll let you have it. But I suggested the Panchavati because so much 










contemplation and meditation have been practised there and the name of God has been chanted 










there so often." 



















It was evening. Incense was burning in the Master's room. He was sitting on the small 










couch, absorbed in meditation. M. was sitting on the floor with Rakhal, Latu, and Ramlal. 



















SINGING OF DEVOTIONAL SONGS 



















The Master said to M., "The sum and substance of the whole thing is to cultivate devotion 










for God and love Him." At Sri Ramakrishna's request Ramlal sang a few songs, the Master himself 










singing the first line of each. 



















Ramlal sang: 



















Oh, what a vision I have beheld in Keshab Bharati's hut! Gora, in all his matchless grace, 










Shedding tears in a thousand streams! Like a mad elephant He dances in ecstasy and sings, Drunk 










with an overwhelming love. . . . Then he sang: Though I am never loath to grant salvation, I 










hesitate indeed to grant pure love. Whoever wins pure love surpasses all; He is adored by men; He 










triumphs over the three worlds. . . . 





































Sri Ramakrishna said to Ramlal, "Sing that one-'Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers'." Ramlal 










began the song and the Master joined him: 



















Gaur and Nitai, ye blessed brothers! I have heard how kind you are, and therefore I have 










come to you. When I visited Benares, Siva, Lord of Kasi, told me Of the Parabrahman's birth, As 










man, in Mother Sachi's home. Brahman, Thee I recognize! Many a sadhu have I seen, But never 










one so kind as you. 



















Once at Braja you were born As Kanai and Balai, His brother; now, once more, in Nadia, As 










Gaur and Nitai do you appear, Hiding the shapes that then you wore. In Braja's pastures running 










freely, once you frolicked; now, for play, You roll on the ground in Nadia, Chanting aloud Lord 










Hari's name. Laughing, shouting, once you played At Braja with your cowherd friends; And now 










you chant Lord Hari's name. 



















Gaur, how cleverly you hide the dark-blue form you wore at Braja! But your slanting eyes 










betray you. Through the blessing of your name the sinner is set free, they say; and so my soul is 










filled with hope. Now with eager heart I hasten to your feet: Lord! I implore you, Keep me safe 










within their shadow. 



















You redeemed Jagai and Madhai, Wretched sinners though they were; I pray you, do the 










same for me. I have heard that you embrace All men as brothers, even the outcaste, Whispering in 










the ears of all Lord Hari's life-renewing name. 



















Late at night M. sat alone in the nahabat. The sky, the river, the garden, the steeples of the 










temples; the trees, and the Panchavati were flooded with moonlight. Deep silence reigned 










everywhere, broken only by the melodious murmuring of the Ganges. M. was meditating on Sri 










Ramakrishna. 



















At three o'clock in the morning M. left his seat. He proceeded toward the Panchavati as Sri 










Ramakrishna had suggested. He did not care for the nahabat any more and resolved to stay in the 










hut in the Panchavati. 



















Suddenly he heard a distant sound, as if someone were wailing piteously, "Oh, where art 










Thou, Brother Madhusudana?" The light of the full moon streamed through the thick foliage of the 










Panchavati, and as he proceeded he saw at a distance one of the Master's disciples sitting alone in 










the grove, crying helplessly, "Oh, where art Thou, Brother Madhusudana?" Silently M. watched 










him. 



















Saturday, December 15, 1883 Story of Prahlada 



















M. had been staying at Dakshineswar with Sri Ramakrishna. The Master was sitting in his 










room, listening to the life of Prahlada, which Ramlal was reading from the Bhaktamala. M. was 










sitting on the floor. Rakhal, Latu, and Harish were also in the room, and Hazra was on the 










verandah. While listening to the story of Prahlada's love for God, Sri Ramakrishna went into an 










ecstatic mood. 



















Hiranyakasipu, the king of the demons and father of Prahlada, had put his son to endless 










torture to divert the boy's mind from the love of God. But through divine grace all the king's 





































attempts to kill Prahlada were ineffective. At last God appeared, assuming the form of Nrisimha, 










the Man-lion, and killed Hiranyakasipu. The gods were frightened at the rage and roaring of the 










Man-lion and thought that the destruction of the world was imminent. 



















They sent Prahlada to pacify the Deity. The boy sang a hymn to Him in words of love, and 










the Man-lion, moved by affection, licked Prahlada's body. 



















Still in an ecstatic mood, the Master said, "Ah! Ah! What love for the devotee!" The Master 










went into deep samadhi. He sat there motionless. A tear-drop could be seen at the corner of each 










of his eyes. 



















MASTER ADMONISHES M. 



















The Master came down to the plane of the sense world and spoke to M., expressing his 










abhorrence for those who, while practising spiritual discipline, enjoyed sex-life. 



















MASTER: "Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You have children, and still you enjoy 










intercourse with your wife. Don't you hate yourself for thus leading an animal life? Don't you hate 










yourself for dallying with a body which contains only blood, phlegm, filth, and excreta? He who 










contemplates the Lotus Feet of God looks on even the most beautiful woman as mere ash from 










the cremation ground. To enjoy a body which will not last and which consists of such impure 










ingredients as intestines, bile, flesh, and bone! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?" 



















M. sat there silently, hanging his head in shame. 



















MASTER: "A man who has tasted even a drop of God's ecstatic love looks on 'woman and 










gold' as most insignificant. He who has tasted syrup made from sugar candy regards a drink made 










from treacle as a mere trifle. One gradually obtains that love for God if one but prays to Him with a 










yearning heart and always chants His name and glories." 



















The Master was in an ecstasy of love. He began to dance about the room and sing: 



















Who is singing Hari's name upon the sacred Ganges' bank? Is it Nitai that has come, the 










giver of heavenly love? 



















It was ten o'clock in the morning. Ramlal had finished the daily worship in the Kali temple. 










The Master went to the temple accompanied by M. Entering the shrine, the Master sat before the 










image. He offered a flower or two at the feet of the Divine Mother. Then he put a flower on his 










own head and began to meditate. He sang a song to the Divine Mother: 



















Thy name, I have heard, Consort of Siva, is the destroyer of our fear, And so on Thee I cast 










my burden: Save me! Save me, kindly Mother! 



















Sri Ramakrishna returned from the Kali temple and sat on the southeast verandah of his 










room. He ate some refreshments which had been offered at the temple, and the devotees also 










received a share. 



















Rakhal sat by the Master and read about Lord Erskine from Self-Help by Smiles. 





































MASTER (to M.): "What does the book say?" 





































M: "It says that Lord Erskine performed his duty without desiring any result for himself. 










Disinterested duty." 



















MASTER: "That is very good. But the characteristic of a man of Perfect Knowledge is that he 










doesn't keep a single book with him. He carries all his Knowledge on the tip of his tongue. 










There's the instance of Sukadeva. Books-I mean the scriptures-contain a mixture of sand and 










sugar. The sadhu takes the sugar, leaving aside the sand. He takes only the essence." 



















Vaishnavcharan, the musician, arrived and sang a few devotional songs. 



















M. spent the night in the nahabat. 



















Sunday, December 16, 1883 



















Sri Ramakrishna was seated with M. on the semicircular porch of his room at about ten 










o'clock in the morning. The fragrance of gardenias, jasmines, oleanders, roses, and other flowers 










filled the air. The Master was singing looking at M: 



















Thou must save me, sweetest Mother! Unto Thee I come for refuge, Helpless as a bird 










imprisoned in a cage. I have done unnumbered wrongs, and aimlessly I roam about, Misled by 










maya's spell, bereft of wisdom's light, Comfortless as a mother cow whose calf has wandered far 










away. 



















MASTER: "But why? Why should I live like a 'bird imprisoned in a cage'? Fie! For shame!" 



















As the Master said these words he went into an ecstatic mood. His body became motionless 










and his mind stopped functioning; tears streamed down his cheeks. After a while he said, "0 










Mother, make me like Sita, completely forgetful of everything-body and limbs-, totally unconscious 










of hands, feet, and sense-organs-only the one thought in her mind, 'Where is Rama?' " 



















Was the Master inspired by the ideal of Sita to teach M. the yearning that a devotee should 










feel for God? Sita's very life was centred in Rama. Completely absorbed in the thought of Rama, 










Sita forgot even the body, which is so dear to all. 



















At four o'clock in the afternoon Mr. Mukherji, a relative of Prankrishna, arrived in the 










company of a brahmin well versed in the scriptures. 



















MUKHERJI: "I am very happy to meet you, sir." 



















MASTER: "God dwells in all beings. He is the gold in all. In some places it is more clearly 










manifest than in others. God dwells in the worldly-minded, no doubt, but He is hidden there, like 










gold under deep layers of clay." 



















MUKHERJI: "Sir, what is the difference between worldly and other-worldly things?" 





































Brahman and the world 





































MASTER: "While striving for the realization of God, the aspirant has to practise 










renunciation, applying the logic of 'Neti, neti'-'Not this, not this', But after attaining the vision of 










God, he realizes that God alone has become all things. 



















"At one time Rama was overpowered by the spirit of renunciation. Dasaratha, worried at 










this, went to the sageVasishtha and begged him to persuade Rama not to give up the world. The 










sage came to Rama and found him in a gloomy mood. The fire of intense renunciation had been 










raging in the Prince's mind. Vasishtha said: 'Rama, why should You renounce the world? Is the 










world outside God? Reason with me.' Rama realized that the world had evolved from the Supreme 










Brahman. So, He said nothing. 



















"Buttermilk is made from the same substance as butter. One who realizes this knows that 










butter goes with buttermilk and buttermilk with butter. After separating the butter with great 










effort-that is to say, after attaining Brahmajnana-you will realize that as long as butter exists, 










buttermilk also must exist. Wherever there is butter there must be buttermilk as well. As long as 










one feels that Brahman exists, one must also be aware that the universe, living beings, and the 










twenty-four cosmic principles exist as well. 



















NATURE OF BRAHMAN 



















"What Brahman is cannot be described in words. Everything has been polluted, like food 










that has touched the tongue-that is, everything has been described in words. But no one has been 










able to describe Brahman. It is therefore unpolluted. I said this to Vidyasagar and he was 










delighted. 



















"But the Knowledge of Brahman cannot be realized if the aspirant is worldly-minded even in 










the slightest degree. He succeeds in acquiring this Knowledge only when his mind is totally free 










from 'woman and gold'. Parvati once said to Her father, 'Father, seek the company of holy men if 










you want the Knowledge of Brahman.' " 



















Addressing Mr. Mukherji, Sri Ramakrishna said: "You are rich, and still you call on God. That 










is very good indeed. It is said in the Gita that those who fall from the path of yoga are born in their 










next birth as devotees of God in rich families." 



















Mr. Mukherji quoted the line from the Gita. 



















MASTER: "God, if He so desires, can keep a Jnani in the world too. The world and all living 










beings have been created by His will. But He is self-willed." 



















MUKHERJI (with a smile): "How can God have any will? Does He lack anything?" 



















MASTER (with a smile): "What's wrong in that? Water is water whether it is still or in waves. 










The snake is a snake whether it is coiled up motionless or wriggles along. A man is the same man 










whether sitting still or engaged in action. 



















"How can you eliminate from the Reality the universe and its living beings? If you do that, It 










will lack Its full weight. You cannot find out the total weight of the bel-fruit if you eliminate the 










seeds and shell. 





































"Brahman is unattached. One finds good and bad smells in the air, but the air itself is 










untainted. Brahman and Sakti are identical. It is the Primordial Power that has become the world 










and all living beings." 



















MUKHERJI: "Why does one deviate from the path of yoga?" 



















MASTER: "As the saying goes: 'In my mother's womb I was in a state of yoga; coming into 










the world, I have eaten its clay. The midwife has cut one shackle, the navel cord; but how shall I 










cut the shackle of maya?' 



















"Woman and gold" 



















"Maya is nothing but 'woman' and 'gold'. A man attains yoga when he has freed his mind 










from these two. The Self-the Supreme Self-is the magnet; the individual self is the needle. The 










individual self experiences the state of yoga when it is attracted by the 



















Supreme Self to Itself. But the magnet cannot attract the needle if the needle is covered 










with clay; it can draw the needle only when the clay is removed. The clay of 'woman' and 'gold' 










must be removed." 



















MUKHERJI: "How can one remove it?" 



















MASTER: "Weep for God with a longing heart. Tears shed for Him will wash away the clay. 










When you have thus freed yourself from impurity, you will be attracted by the magnet. Only then 










will you attain yoga." 



















MUKHERJI: "Priceless words!" 



















MASTER: "If a man is able to weep for God, he will see Him. He will go into samadhi. 










Perfection in yoga is samadhi. A man achieves kumbhaka without any yogic exercise if he but 










weeps for God. The next stage is samadhi. 



















"There is another method -that of meditation. In the Sahasrara, Siva manifests Himself in a 










special manner. The aspirant should meditate on Him. The body is like a tray; the mind and buddhi 










are like water. The Sun of Satchidananda is reflected in this water. Meditating on the reflected sun, 










one sees the Real Sun through the grace of God. 



















"But the worldly man must constantly live in the company of holy men. It is necessary for 










all, even for sannyasis. But it is especially necessary for the householder. His disease has become 










chronic because he has to live constantly in the midst of 'woman and gold'." 



















MUKHERJI: "Yes, sir. The disease has indeed become chronic" 



















MASTER: "Give God the power of attorney. Let Him do whatever He wants. Be like a kitten 










and cry to Him with a fervent heart. The mother cat puts the kitten wherever she wants to. The 










kitten doesn't know anything. It is left sometimes on the bed and sometimes near the hearth." 



















MUKHERJI: "It is good to read sacred books like the Gita." 





































MASTER: "But what will you gain by mere reading? Some have heard of milk, some have 










seen it, and there are some, besides, who have drunk it. God can indeed be seen; what is more, 










one can talk to Him. 



















DIFFERENT STAGES OF SPIRITUAL PROGRESS 



















"The first stage is that of the beginner. He studies and hears. Second is the stage of the 










struggling aspirant. He prays to God, meditates on Him, and sings His name and glories. The third 










stage is that of the perfect soul. He has seen God, realized Him directly and immediately in his 










inner Consciousness. Last is the stage of the supremely perfect, like Chaitanya. Such a devotee 










establishes a definite relationship with God, looking on Him as his Son or Beloved." 



















M., Rakhal, Jogin, Latu, and the other devotees were entranced by these words of divine 










realization. 



















Mr. Mukherji and his friend were taking leave of the Master. After saluting him, they stood 










up. The Master also stood up to show them courtesy. 



















MUKHERJI (smiling): "That you should stand up or sit down!" 



















MASTER (smiling): "But what's the harm? Water is water whether it is placid or in waves. I 










am like a cast-off leaf in the wind. The wind blows that leaf wherever it lists. I am the machine and 










God is its Operator." 



















Mr. Mukherji and his friend left the room. M. thought: "According to the Vedanta all is like a 










dream. Are all these-the ego, the universe, and the living beings-unreal then?" 



















M. had studied a little of the Vedanta. He also had read the German philosophers, such as 










Kant and Hegel, whose writings are only a faint echo of the Vedanta. But Sri Ramakrishna did not 










arrive at his conclusions by reasoning, as do ordinary scholars. It was the Divine Mother of the 










Universe who revealed the Truth to him. These were the thoughts that passed through M.'s mind. 



















A little later Sri Ramakrishna and M. were conversing on the porch west of the Master's 










room. No one else was there. It was a late winter afternoon, and the sun had not yet gone below 










the horizon. 



















IS THE WORLD UNREAL? 



















M: "Is the world unreal?" 



















MASTER: "Why should it be unreal? What you are asking is a matter for philosophical 










discussion. 



















"In the beginning, when a man reasons following the Vedantic method of 'Not this, not this', 










he realizes that Brahman is not the living beings, not the universe, not the twenty-four cosmic 










principles. All these things become like dreams to him. Then comes the affirmation of what has 










been denied, and he feels that God Himself has become the universe and all living beings. 





































"Suppose you are climbing to the roof by the stairs. As long as you are aware of the roof, 










you are also aware of the stairs. He who is aware of the high is also aware of the low. But after 










reaching the roof you realize that the stairs are made of the same materials-brick, lime, and 










brick-dust-as the roof. 



















"Further, I have given the illustration of the bel-fruit. Both changeability and 










unchangeability belong to one and the same Reality. 



















"The ego cannot be done away with. As long as 'l-consciousness' exists, living beings and the 










universe must also exist. After realizing God, one sees that, it is He Himself who has become the 










universe and the living beings. But one cannot realize this by mere reasoning. 



















"Siva has two states of mind. First, the state of samadhi, when He is transfixed in the Great 










Yoga. He is then Atmarama, satisfied in the Self. Second, the state when He descends from 










samadhi and keeps a trace of ego. Then He dances about, chanting, 'Rama, Rama!'" 



















Did the Master describe Siva to hint at his own state of mind? 



















It was evening. Sri Ramakrishna was meditating on the Divine Mother and chanting Her holy 










name. The devotees also went off to solitary places and meditate on their Chosen Ideals. 










Evening worship began at the temple garden in the shrines of Kali, Radha-Krishna, and Siva. 



















It was the second day of the dark fortnight of the moon. Soon the moon rose in the sky, 










bathing temples, trees, flowers, and the rippling surface of the Ganges in its light. The Master was 










sitting on the couch and M. on the floor. The conversation turned to the Vedanta. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Why should the universe be unreal? That is a speculation of the 










philosophers. After realizing God, one sees that it is God Himself who has become the universe 










and all living beings. 



















DIVINE MOTHER IS THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS 



















"The Divine Mother revealed to me in the Kali temple that it was She who had become 










everything. She showed me that everything was full of Consciousness. The Image was 










Consciousness, the altar was Consciousness, the water-vessels were Consciousness, the door-sill 










was Consciousness, the marble floor was Consciousness-all was Consciousness. 



















"I found everything inside the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss-the Bliss of Satchidananda. 










I saw a wicked man in front of the Kali temple; but in him also I saw the Power of the Divine 










Mother vibrating. 



















"That was why I fed a cat with the food that was to be offered to the Divine Mother. I 










clearly perceived that the Divine Mother Herself had become everything-even the cat. The 










manager of the temple garden wrote to Mathur Babu saying that I was feeding the cat with the 










offering intended for the Divine Mother. But Mathur Babu had insight into the state of my mind. 










He wrote back to the manager: 'Let him do whatever he likes. You must not say anything to him.' 





































"After realizing God, one sees all this aright-that it is He who has become the universe, 










living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles. But what remains when God completely 










effaces the ego cannot be described in words. As Ramprasad said in one of his songs, 'Then alone 










will you know whether you are good or I am good!' I get into even that state now and then. 



















"A man sees a thing in one way through reasoning and in an altogether different way when 










God Himself shows it to him." 



















Monday, December 17, 1883 



















It was about eight o'clock in the morning. Sri Ramakrishna was in his room with M., when 










Dr. Madhu arrived and sat down beside the Master on the small couch. He was an elderly man and 










full of wit. He used to visit the Master when the latter felt indisposed. 



















MASTER: "The whole thing, in a nutshell is that one must develop ecstatic love for 










Satchidananda. What kind of love? How should one love God? Gauri used to say that one must 










become like Sita to understand Rama; like Bhagavati, the Divine Mother, to understand Bhagavan, 










Siva. One must practise austerity, as Bhagavati did, in order to attain Siva. One must cultivate the 










attitude of Prakriti in order to realize Purusha-the attitude of a friend, a handmaid, or a mother. 



















"I saw Sita in a vision. I found that her entire mind was concentrated on Rama. She was 










totally indifferent to everything-her hands, her feet, her clothes, her jewels. It seemed that Rama 










had filled every bit of her life and she could not remain alive without Rama." 



















M: "Yes, sir. She was mad with love for Rama." 



















MASTER: "Mad! That's the word. One must become mad with love in order to realize God. 










But that love is not possible if the mind dwells on 'woman and gold'. Sex-life with a woman! What 










happiness is there in that? The realization of God gives ten million times more happiness. Gauri 










used to say that when a man attains ecstatic love of God all the pores of the skin, even the roots of 










the hair, become like so many sexual organs, and in every pore the aspirant enjoys the happiness 










of communion with the Atman. 



















"One must call on God with a longing heart. One must learn from the guru how God can be 










realized. Only if the guru himself has attained Perfect Knowledge can he show the way. 



















"A man, gets rid of all desires when he has Perfect Knowledge. He becomes like a child five 










years old. Sages like Dattatreya and Jadabharata had the nature of a child." 



















M: "One hears about them. But there were many others like them that the world doesn't 










hear about." 





































MASTER: "Yes. The Jnani gets rid of all desire if any is left, it does not hurt him. At the touch 










of the philosopher's stone the sword is transformed into gold. Then that sword cannot do any 





































killing. Just so, the Jnani keeps only a semblance of anger and passion. They are anger and passion 










only in name and cannot injure him." 



















M: "Yes, sir. The Jnani goes beyond the three gunas, as you say. He is not under the control 










of any of the gunas-sattva, rajas, or tamas. All these three are so many robbers, as it were." 



















MASTER: "Yes, one must assimilate that." 



















M: "In this world there are perhaps not more than three or four men of Perfect 










Knowledge." 



















MASTER: "Why do you say that? One sees many holy men and sannyasis in the monasteries 










of upper India." 



















M: "Well, I too can become a sannyasi like one of those." The Master fixed his gaze on M. 










and said, "By renouncing everything?" 



















M: "What can a man achieve unless he gets rid of maya? What will a man gain by merely 










being a sannyasi, if he cannot subdue maya?" 



















Both remained silent a few minutes. 



















M: "Sir, what is the nature of the divine love transcending the three gunas?" MASTER: 










"Attaining that love, the devotee sees everything full of Spirit and Consciousness. To him 'Krishna 










is Consciousness, and His sacred Abode is also Consciousness'. The devotee, too, is Consciousness. 










Everything is Consciousness. Very few people attain such love." DR. MADHU: "The love 










transcending the three gunas means, in other words, that the devotee is not under the control of 










any of the gunas." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Yes, that's it. He becomes like a child five years old, not under the 










control of any of the gunas." The Master was resting after his noon meal. Mani Mallick arrived and 










saluted him. Sri Ramakrishna remained lying on the couch and said a word or two to Mani. MANI: 










"I hear you visited Keshab Sen." MASTER: "Yes. How is he now?" MANI: "He hasn't recovered to 










any extent from his illness." MASTER: "I found him to be very rajasic. I had to wait a long time 










before I could see him." The Master sat up on the couch and continued his conversation with the 










devotees. 



















MASTER (to M.): "I became mad for Rama. I used to walk about carrying an image of 










Ramlala given to me by a monk. I bathed it, fed it, and laid it down to sleep. I carried it wherever I 










went. I became mad for Ramlala." 



















M. AT DAKSHINESWAR (I) 



















Tuesday, December 18, 1883 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was seated in his room with his devotees. He spoke highly of 










Devendranath Tagore's love of God and renunciation, and then said, pointing to Rakhal and the 










other young devotees, "Devendra is a good man; but blessed indeed are those young aspirants 





































who, like Sukadeva, practise renunciation from their very boyhood and think of God day and night 










without being involved in worldly life. 



















NATURE OF WORLDLY PEOPLE 



















"The worldly man always has some desire or other, though at times he shows much 










devotion to God. Once Mathur Babu was entangled in a lawsuit. He said to me in the shrine of Kali, 










'Sir, please offer this flower to the Divine Mother.' I offered it unsuspectingly, but he firmly 










believed that he would attain his objective if I offered the flower. 



















"What devotion Rati's mother had! How often she used to come here and how much she 










served me! She was a Vaishnava. One day she noticed that I ate the food offered at the Kali 










temple, and that stopped her coming. Her devotion to God was one-sided. It isn't possible to 










understand a person right away." 



















It was a winter morning, and the Master was sitting near the east door of his room, 










wrapped in his moleskin shawl. He looked at the sun and suddenly went into samadhi. His eyes 










stopped blinking and he lost all consciousness of the outer world. After a long time he came down 










to the plane of the sense world. Rakhal, Hazra, M., and other devotees were seated near him. 



















MASTER (to Hazra): "The state of samadhi is certainly inspired by love. Once, at Syambazar, 










they arranged a kirtan at Natavar Goswami's house. There I had a vision of Krishna and the gopis of 










Vrindavan. I felt that my subtle body was walking at Krishna's heels. 



















"I went into samadhi when similar devotional songs were sung at the Hari Sabha in 










Jorashanko in Calcutta. That day they feared I might give up the body." 



















After the Master had finished his bath, he again spoke of the ecstatic love of the gopis. He 










said to M. and the other devotees: "One should accept the fervent attachment of the gopis to their 










beloved Krishna. Sing songs like this: 



















Tell me, friend, how far is the grove Where Krishna, my Beloved, dwells? His fragrance 










reaches me even here; but I am tired and can walk no farther." 



















Again he sang: 



















I am not going home, friend, For there it is hard for me to chant my Krishna's name. . . 










Sri Ramakrishna had vowed to offer green coconut and sugar to Siddhesvari, the Divine Mother, 










for RakhaTs welfare. He asked M. whether he would pay for the offerings. 



















That afternoon the Master, accompanied by M., Rakhal, and some other devotees, set out 










in a carriage for the temple of Siddhesvari in Calcutta. On the way the offerings were purchased. 










On reaching the temple, the Master asked the devotees to offer the fruit and sugar to the Divine 










Mother. They saw the priests and their friends playing cards in the temple. Sri Ramakrishna said: 










"To play cards in a temple! One should think of God here." 



















From the temple the Master went to Jadu Mallick's house. Jadu was surrounded by his 










admirers, well-dressed dandies. He welcomed the Master. 





































MASTER ((with a smile): "Why do you keep so many clowns and flatterers with you?" 










JADU (smiling): "That you may liberate them." (Laughter.) 



















MASTER: "Flatterers think that the rich man will loosen his purse-strings for them. But it is 










very difficult to get anything from him. Once a jackal saw a bullock and would not give up his 










company. The bullock roamed about and the jackal followed him. The jackal thought: 'There hang 










the bullock's testicles. Some time or other they will drop to the ground and I shall eat them.' When 










the bullock slept on the ground, the jackal lay down too, and when the bullock moved about, the 










jackal followed him. Many days passed in this way, but the bullock's testicles still clung to his body. 










The jackal went away disappointed. (All laugh.) That also happens to flatterers." 



















Jadu and his mother served refreshments to Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees. 



















Wednesday, December 19, 1883 



















It was nine o'clock in the morning. Sri Ramakrishna was talking to M. near the bel-tree at 










Dakshineswar. This tree, under which the Master had practised the most austere sadhana, stood in 










the northern end of the temple garden. Farther north ran a high wall, and just outside was the 










government magazine. West of the bel-tree was a row of tall pines that rustled in the wind. 










Below the trees flowed the Ganges, and to the south could be seen the sacred grove of the 










Panchavati. The dense trees and underbrush hid the temples. No noise of the outside world 










reached the bel-tree. 



















MASTER (to M.): "But one cannot realize God without renouncing 'woman and gold'." 



















M: "Why? Did not Vasishtha say to Rama, '0 Rama, You may renounce the world if the 










world is outside God'?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "He said that to Rama so that Rama might destroy Ravana. Rama 










accepted the life of a householder and married to fulfil that mission." 



















M. stood there like a log, stunned and speechless. 



















Sri Ramakrishna went to the Panchavati on his way back to his room. M. accompanied him. 










It was then about ten o'clock. 



















PATH OF THE IMPERSONAL GOD 



















M: "Sir, is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of the Impersonal God?" 










MASTER: "Yes, there is. But the path is extremely difficult. After intense austerities the rishis of 










olden times realized God as their inner most consciousness and experienced the real nature of 










Brahman. But how hard they had to work! They went out of their dwellings in the early morning 










and all day practised austerities and meditation. Returning home at nightfall, they took a light 










supper of fruit and roots. 



















"But an aspirant cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if his mind is stained with 










worldliness even in the slightest degree. The mind must withdraw totally from all objects of form, 










taste, smell, touch, and sound. Only thus does it become pure. The Pure Mind is the same as the 





































Pure Atman. But such a mind must be altogether free from 'woman and gold'. When it becomes 










pure, one has another experience. One realizes: 'God alone is the Doer, and I am His instrument.' 










One does not feel oneself to be absolutely necessary to others either in their misery or in their 










happiness. 



















"Once a wicked man beat into unconsciousness a monk who lived in a monastery. On 










regaining consciousness he was asked by his friends, 'Who is feeding you milk?' The monk said, 'He 










who beat me is now feeding me.' " 



















M: "Yes, sir. I know that story." 



















OBSTACLES TO SAMADHI 



















MASTER: "It is not enough to know it. One must assimilate its meaning. It is the thought of 










worldly objects that prevents the mind from going into samadhi. One becomes established in 










samadhi when one is completely rid of worldliness. It is possible for me to give up the body in 










samadhi; but I have a slight desire to enjoy the love of God and the company of His devotees. 










Therefore I pay a little attention to my body. 



















"There is another kind of samadhi, called unmana samadhi. One attains it by suddenly 










gathering the dispersed mind. You understand what that is, don't you?" 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "Yes. It is the sudden withdrawal of the dispersed mind to the Ideal. But that 










samadhi does not last long. Worldly thoughts intrude and destroy it. The yogi slips down from his 










yoga. 



















"At Kamarpukur I have seen the mongoose living in its hole up in the wall. It feels snug 










there. Sometimes people tie a brick to its tail; then the pull of the brick makes it come out of its 










hole. Every time the mongoose tries to be comfortable inside the hole, it has to come out because 










of the pull of the brick. Such is the effect of brooding on worldly objects that it makes the yogi 










stray from the path of yoga. 



















"Worldly people may now and then experience samadhi. The lotus blooms, no doubt, when 










the sun is up; but its petals close again when the sun is covered by a cloud. Worldly thought is the 










cloud." 



















M: "Isn't it possible to develop both jnana and bhakti by the practice of spiritual discipline?" 



















MASTER: "Through the path of bhakti a man may attain them both. If it is necessary, God 










gives him the Knowledge of Brahman. But a highly qualified aspirant may develop both jnana and 










bhakti at the same time. Such is the case with the Isvarakotis-Chaitanya for example. But the case 










of ordinary devotees is different. 



















"There are five kinds of light: the light of a lamp, the light of various kinds of fire, the light of 










the moon, the light of the sun, and lastly the combined light of the sun and the moon. Bhakti is the 










light of the moon, and jnana the light of the sun. 





































"Sometimes it is seen that the sun has hardly set when the moon rises in the sky. In an 










Incarnation of God one sees, at the same time, the sun of Knowledge and the moon of Love. 



















"Can everyone, by the mere wish, develop Knowledge and Love at the same time? It 










depends on the person. One bamboo is more hollow than another. Is it possible for all to 










comprehend the nature of God? Can a one seer pot hold five seers of milk?" 



















M: "But what about the grace of God? Through His grace a camel can pass through the eye 










of a needle." 



















MASTER: "But is it possible to obtain God's grace just like that? A beggar may get a penny, if 










he asks for it. But suppose he asks you right off for his train fare: How about that?" 



















M. stood silent. The Master, too, remained silent. Suddenly he said: "Yes, it is true. Through 










the grace of God some may get both jnana and bhakti." 



















M. saluted the Master and went back to the bel-tree. 



















At midday, finding that M. had not yet returned, Sri Ramakrishna started toward the 










bel-tree; but on reaching the Panchavati he met M. carrying his prayer carpet and water-jug. M. 










saluted the Master. 



















Sri Ramakrishna said to M: "I was coming to look for you. Because of your delay I thought 










you might have scaled the wall and run away. I watched your eyes this morning and felt 










apprehensive lest you should go away like Narayan Shastri. Then I said to myself: 'No, he won't run 










away. He thinks a great deal before doing anything.' " 



















The same night the Master talked to M., Rakhal , Latu, Harish, and a few other devotees. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Some people give a metaphysical interpretation of the Vrindavan episode 










of Sri Krishna's life. What do you say about it?" 



















M: "There are various opinions. What if there are? You have told us the story of 










Bhishmadeva's weeping, on his bed of arrows, because he could not understand anything of God's 










ways. 



















"Again, you have told us that Hanuman used to say: 'I don't know any thing about the day of 










the week, the position of the stars, and so forth. I only meditate on Rama.' 



















"Further, you have said to us that in the last analysis there are two things only. Brahman 










and Its Power. You have also said that, after the attainment of Brahmajnana, a man realizes these 










two to be One, the One that has no two" 



















MASTER: "Yes, that is true. Your ideal is to reach the goal. You may reach it by going either 










through a thorny forest or along a good road. 



















"Diverse opinions certainly exist. Nangta used to say that the monks could not be feasted 










because of the diversity of their views. Once a feast was arranged for the sannyasis. Monks 










belonging to many sects were invited. Everyone claimed that his sect should be fed first, but no 





































conclusion could be arrived at. At last they all went away and the food had to be given to the 










prostitutes." 



















M: "Totapuri was indeed a great soul." 



















MASTER: "But Hazra says he was an ordinary man. There's no use in discussing these things. 










Everyone says that his watch alone gives the correct time. 



















"You see, Narayan Shastri developed a spirit of intense renunciation. He was a great 










scholar. He gave up his wife and went away. A man attains yoga when he completely effaces 










'woman and gold' from his mind. With some, the characteristics of the yogi are well marked. 



















"I shall have to tell you something of the six centres. The mind of the yogi passes through 










these, and he realizes God through His grace. Have you heard of the six centres?" 



















M: "These are the 'seven planes' of the Vedanta." 



















MASTER: "Not the Vedanta, but the Vedas. Do you know what the six centres are like? They 










are the 'lotuses' in the subtle body. The yogis see them. They are like the fruits and leaves of a wax 










tree." 



















M: "Yes, sir. The yogis can perceive them. I have read that there is a kind of glass through 










which a tiny object looks very big. Likewise, through yoga one can see those subtle lotuses." 



















Following Sri Ramakrishna's direction, M. spent the night in the hut at the Panchavati. In the 










early hours of the morning he was singing alone: 



















I am without the least benefit of prayer and austerity, Lord! 



















I am the lowliest of the lowly; make me pure with Thy hallowed touch. 



















One by one I pass my days in hope of reaching Thy Lotus Feet, 



















But Thee, alas, I have not found. . . . 



















Suddenly M. glanced toward the window and saw the Master standing there. Sri 










Ramakrishna's eyes became heavy with tears as M. sang the line: 



















I am the lowliest of the lowly; make me pure with Thy hallowed touch. 



















M. sang again: 



















I shall put on the ochre robe and ear-rings made of conch-shell; Thus, in the garb of a yogini, 










from place to place I shall wander, till I have found my cruel Hari. . . . 



















M. saw that the Master was walking with Rakhal. 



















Friday, December 21, 1883 



















In the morning the Master and M. were conversing alone under the bel-tree. The Master 










told him many secrets of spiritual discipline, exhorting him to renounce "woman and gold". He 










further said that the mind at times becomes one's guru. 





































After his midday meal the Master went to the Panchavati wearing a beautiful yellow robe. 










Two or three Vaishnava monks were there, clad in the dress of their sect. 



















In the afternoon a monk belonging to the sect of Nanak arrived. He was a worshipper of the 










formless God. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to meditate as well on God with form. The Master said to 










him: "Dive deep; one does not get the precious gems by merely floating on the surface. God is 










without form, no doubt; but He also has form. By meditating on God with form one speedily 










acquires devotion; then one can meditate on the formless God. It is like throwing a letter away, 










after learning its contents, and then setting out to follow its instructions." 



















Saturday, December 22, 1883 



















Rakhal, Harish, M., and Latu had been staying with Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar. About 










nine o'clock in the morning the Master was sitting with them on the southeast verandah of his 










room, when Balaram's father and Devendra Ghosh of Syampukur arrived. 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, how does one obtain love for God?" 



















MASTER: "Go forward. The king dwells beyond the seven gates. You can see him only after 










passing through all the gates. 



















"At the time of the installation of Annapurna at Chanak, I said to Dwarika Babu: 'Large fish 










live in the deep water of a big lake. Throw some spiced bait into the water; then the fish will come, 










attracted by its smell; now and then they will make the water splash. Devotion and ecstatic love 










are like the spiced bait. 



















DIVINE INCARNATIONS 



















"God sports in the world as man. He incarnates Himself as man-as in the case of Krishna, 










Rama, and Chaitanya. Once I said to Keshab: 'The greatest manifestation of God is in man. There 










are small holes in the balk of a field, where crabs and fish accumulate in the rainy season. If you 










want to find them you must seek them in the holes. If you seek God, you must seek Him in the 










Incarnations.' 



















"The Divine Mother of the Universe manifests Herself through this three-and-a-half cubit 










man. There is a song that says: 



















Mother, what a machine is this that Thou hast made! What pranks Thou playest with this 










toy Three and a half cubits high! 



















"One needs spiritual practice in order to know God and recognize Divine Incarnations. 



















Big fish live in the large lake, but to see them one must throw spiced bait in the water. 



















There is butter in milk, but one must churn the milk to get it. There is oil in mustard-seed, 










but one must press the seed to extract the oil." 





































DEVOTEE: "Has God form, or is He formless?" 





































MASTER:" Wait, wait! First of all you must go to Calcutta; then only will you know where the 










Maidan, the Asiatic Society, and the Bengal Bank are located. If you want to go to the brahmin 










quarter of Khardaha, you must first of all go to Khardaha. 



















"Why should it not be possible to practice the discipline of the formless God? But it is very 










difficult to follow that path. One cannot follow it without renouncing 'woman and gold'. There 










must be complete renunciation, both inner and outer. You cannot succeed in this path if you have 










the slightest trace of worldliness. 



















"It is easy to worship God with form. But it is not easy as all that. 



















"One should not discuss the discipline of the Impersonal God or the path of knowledge with 










a bhakta. Through great effort perhaps he is just cultivating a little devotion. You will injure it if you 










explain away everything as a mere dream. 



















"Kabir was a worshipper of the Impersonal God. He did not believe in Siva, Kali, or Krishna. 










He used to make fun of them and say that Kali lived on the offerings of rice and banana, and that 










Krishna danced like a monkey when the gopis clapped their hands. (All laugh). 



















"One who worships God without form perhaps sees at first the deity with ten arms, then 










the deity with four arms, then the Baby Krishna with two arms. At last he sees the Indivissible Light 










and merges in It. 



















"It is said that sages like Dattatreya and Jadabharata did not return to the relative plane 










after having the visition of Brahman. According to some people Sukadeva tasted only a drop of 










that Ocean of Brahman-Consciousness. He saw and heard the rumbling of the waves of that 










Ocean, but did not dive into It. 



















"A brahmachari once said to me, 'One who goes beyond Kedar cannot keep his body alive.' 










Likewise, a man cannot preserve his body after attaining Brahmajnana. The body drops off in 










twenty-one days. 



















"There was an infinite field beyond a high wall. Four friends tried to find out what was 










beyond the wall. Three of them, one after the other, climbed the wall, saw the field, burst into 










loud laughter, and dropped to the other side. These three could not give any information about 










the field. Only the fourth man came back and told people about it. 



















He is like those who retain their bodies, even after attaining Brahmajnana, in order to teach 










others. Divine Incarnations belong to this class. 



















"Parvati was born as the daughter of King Himalaya. After Her birth She revealed to the 










king Her various divine forms. The father said: 'Well, Daughter, You have shown me all these 










forms. That is nice. But You have another aspect, which is Brahman. Please show me that.' 'Father,' 










replied Parvati, 'if you seek the Knowledge of Brahman, then renounce the world and live in the 










company of holy men.' But King Himalaya insisted. Thereupon Parvati revealed Her Brahman-form, 










and immediately the king fell down unconscious. 





































"All that I have just said belongs to the realm of reasoning. Brahman alone is real and the 










world illusory-that is reasoning. And everything but Brahman is like a dream. But this is an 










extremely difficult path. To one who follows it even the divine play in the world becomes like a 










dream and appears unreal; his T also vanishes. The followers of this path do not accept the Divine 










Incarnation. It is a very difficult path. The lovers of God should not hear much of such reasoning. 



















"That is why God incarnates Himself as man and teaches people the path of devotion. He 










exhorts people to cultivate self-surrender to God. Following the path of devotion, one realizes 










everything through His grace both Knowledge and Supreme Wisdom. 



















"God sports in this world. He is under the control of His devotee. 'Syama, the Divine 










Mother, is Herself tied by the cord of the love of Her devotee.' 



















"Sometimes God becomes the magnet and the devotee the needle, and sometimes the 










devotee becomes the magnet and God the needle. The devotee attracts God to him. God is the 










Beloved of His devotee and is under his control. 



















"According to one school, the gopis of Vrindavan, like Yasoda, had believed in the formless 










God in their previous births; but they did not derive any satisfaction from this belief. That is why 










later on they enjoyed so much bliss in the company of Sri Krishna in the Vrindavan episode of His 










life. One day Krishna said to the gopis: 'Come along. I shall show you the Abode of the Eternal. Let 










us go to the Jamuna for a bath.' As they dived into the water of the river, they at once saw Goloka. 










Next they saw the Indivisible Light. Thereupon Yasoda exclaimed: '0 Krishna, we don't care for 










these things any more. We would like to see You in Your human form. I want to take You in my 










arms and feed You.' 



















GOD AND HIS DEVOTEE 



















"So the greatest manifestation of God is through His Incarnations. The devotee should 










worship and serve an Incarnation of God as long as He lives in a human body. 'At the break of day 










He disappears into the secret chamber of His House.' 



















GOD MANIFESTING HIMSELF AS LIVING BEINGS 



















"Not all, by any means, can recognize an Incarnation of God. Assuming a human body, the 










Incarnation falls victim to disease, grief, hunger, thirst, and all such things, like ordinary mortals. 










Rama wept for Sita. 'Brahman weeps, entrapped in the snare of the five elements.' 



















"It is said in the Purana that God, in His Incarnation as the Sow, lived happily with His young 










ones even after the destruction of Hiranyaksha. As the Sow, He nursed them and forgot all about 










His abode in heaven. At last Siva killed the sow body with his trident, and God, laughing aloud, 










went to His own abode." 



















In the afternoon Bhavanath arrived. Rakhal , M., Harish, and other devotees were in the 



















room. 



















MASTER (to Bhavanath): "To love an Incarnation of God- that is enough. Ah, what ecstatic 










love the gopis had for Krishna!" 





































Sri Ramakrishna began to sing, asuming the attitude of the gopis: 



















Krishna! You are the Soul of my soul... 










Then he sang: 



















1 am not going home, friend, For there it is hard for me to chant my Krishna's name... 










And again: 



















Friend, that day I stood at my door as You were going to the woods... 



















Continuing, the Master said: "When Krishna suddenly disappeared in the act of dancing and 










playing with gopis, they were beside themselves with grief. Looking at tree, they said: '0 tree, you 










must be a great hermit. You must have seen Krishna. Otherwise, why do you stand there 










motionless, as if absorbed in samadhi?' Looking at the earth covered with green grass, they said" 










'0 earth, you must have seen Kirshna. Otherwise, why does your hair stand on end? you must have 










enjoyed the thrill of His touch.' Looking at the madhavi creeper, they said, '0 madhavi, give us back 










our Madhava!' The gopis were intoxicated with ecstatic love for Krishna. Akrura came to Vrindavan 










to take Krishna and Balarama to Mathura. When they mounted the chariot, the gopis clung to the 










wheels. They would not let the chariot move." 



















Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna sang, assuming the attitude of Akrura: 



















Hold not, hold not the chariot's wheels! Is it the wheels that make it move? The Mover of its 










wheels is Krishna, By whose will the worlds are moved.... 



















MASTER: '"Is it the wheels that make it move?' 'By whose will the worlds are moved.' 'The 










driver moves the chariot at His Master's bidding.' I feel deeply touched by these lines." 



















Sunday, December 23, 1883 



















At nine o'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna was seated on the southwest porch of his 










room, with Rakhal , Latu, M., Harish, and some other devotees. M. had now been nine days with 










the Master at Dakshineswar. Earlier in the morning Manomohan had arrived from Konnagar on 










this way to Calcutta. Hazra, too, was present. 



















A Vaishnava was singging. Referring to one of the songs, Sri Ramakrishna said: "I didn't 










enjoy that song very much. The songs of the earlier writers seem to me to have more of the right 










spirit. Once I sang for Nangta at the Panchavati: 'To arms! To arms, man! Death storms your 










house in battle array.' I sang another: '0 Mother, I have no one else to bla me: Alas! I sink in the 










well these very hands have dug.' 



















"Nangta, the Vedantist, was a man of profound knowledge. The song moved him to tears 










though he didn't understand its meaning. Padmalochan also wept when I sang the songs of 










Ramprasad about the Divine Mother. And he was truly a great pundit." 



















After the midday meal Sri Ramakrishna rested a few minutes in his room. M. was sitting on 










the floor. The Master was delighted to hear the music that was being played in the nahabat. He 










then explained to M. that Brahman alone has become the universe and all living beings. 





































MASTER: "Referring to a certain place, someone once said to me: 'Nobody sings the name 










of God there. It has no holy atmosphere.' No sooner did he say this than I perceived that it was 










God alone who had become all living beings. They appeared as countless bubbles, or reflections in 










the Ocean of Satchidananda. 



















"Again, I find sometimes that living beings are like so many pills made of Indivisible 










Consciousness. Once I was on my way to Burdwan from Kamarpukur. At one place I ran to the 










meadow to see how living beings are sustained. I saw ants crawling there. It appeared to me that 










every place was filled with Consciousness." 



















Hazra entered the room and sat on the floor. 



















MASTER: "Again, I perceive that living beings are like different flowers with various layers of 










petals. They are also revealed to me as bubbles, some big, some small." 



















MASTER'S CHILDLIKE MOOD 



















While describing in this way the vision of different divine forms, the Master went into an 










ecstatic state and said, "I have become! I am here!" Uttering these words he went into samadhi. 










His body was motionless. He remained in that state a long time and then gradually regained partial 










consciousness of the world. He began to laugh like a boy and pace the room. His eyes radiated 










bliss as if he had seen a wondrous vision. His gaze was not fixed on any particular object, and his 










face beamed with joy. Still pacing the room, the Master said: "I saw the paramahamsa who stayed 










under the banyan tree walking thus with just such a smile. Am I too in that state of mind?" 



















He sat on the small couch and engaged in conversation with the Divine Mother. 



















MASTER: "I don't even care to know. Mother, may I have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet! 



















(To M.) "One attains this state immediately after freeing oneself of all grief and desire. 



















(To the Divine Mother) "Mother, Thou hast done away with my worship. Please see, 










Mother, that I don't give up all desire. Mother, the paramahamsa is but a child. Doesn't a child 










need a mother? Therefore Thou art the Mother and I am the child. How can the child live without 










the Mother?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna was talking to the Divine Mother in a voice that would have melted even a 










stone. Again he addressed Her, saying: "mere knowledge of Advaita! I spit on it! Thou doest exist 










as long as Thou dost keep the ego in me. The paramahamsa is but a child. Doesn't a child need a 










mother?" 



















M. sat there speechless and looked at the divine manifestation in the Master. He said to 










himself: "The Master is an ocean of mercy that knows no motive. He has kept himself in the state 










of a paramahamsa that he might, as teacher, awaken the spiritual consciousness of myself and 










other earnest souls." 



















M. further thought: "The Master says, 'Advaita-Chaitanya-Nitayananda'; that is to say, 










through the knowledge of the Non-dual Brahman one attains Consciousness and enjoys Eternal 





































Bliss. The master has not only attained the knowledge of non-duality but is in a state of Eternal 










Blisss. He is always drunk with ecstatic love for the Mother of the Universe." 



















With folded hands Hazara looked at the Master and said every now and they:"How blessed 










you are! How blessed you are!" 



















MASTER (to Hazra): "But you have hardly any faith; you simply live here to add to the play, 










like Jatila and Kutila." 



















In the afternoon M. paced the temple garden alone. He was deeply absorbed in the thought 










of the Master and was pondering the Master's words concerning the attainment of the exalted 










state of the paramahamsa, after the elimination of grief and desire. M. said to himself: "Who is 










this Sri Ramakrishna, acting as my teacher? Has God embodied Himself for our welfare? The 










master himself says that none but an Incarnation can come down to the phenomenal plane from 










the state of nirvikalpa samadhi." 



















Monday, December 24, 1883 



















At eight o'clock in the morning Sri Ramakrishna and M. were talking together in the 










pine-grove at the northern end of the temple garden. This was the eleventh day of M.'s stay with 










the Master. 



















It was winter. The sun had just risen. The river was flowing north with the tide. Not far off 










could be seen the bel-tree where the Master had practised great spiritual austerities. Sri 










Ramakrishna faced the east as he talked to his disciple and told him about the Knowledge of 










Brahman. 



















MASTER: "The formless God is real, and equally real is God with form. Nangta used to 










instruct me about the nature of Satchidananda Brahman. He would say that It is like an infinite 










ocean- water everywhere, to the right, left, above, and below. Water enveloped in water. It is the 










Water of the Great Cause, motionless. Waves spring up when It becomes active. Its activities are 










creation, preservation and destruction. 



















"Again, he ued to say that Brahman is where reason comes to stop. There is the instance of 










camphor. Nothing remains after it is burnt-not even a trace of ash. 



















"Brahman is beyond mind and speech. A salt doll entered the ocean to measure its depth; 










but it did not return to tell others how deep the ocean was. It melted in the ocean itself. 



















"The rishis once said to Rama: '0 Rama, sages like Bharadvaja may very well call you an 










Incarnation of God, but we cannot do that. We adore the Word-Brahman. We do not want the 










human form of God.' Rama smiled and went away, pleased with their adoration. 



















DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ABSOLUTE 



















"But the Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of the same Reality. As I have said before, it 










is like the roof and the steps leading to it. The Absolute plays in many ways: 





































as Isvara, as the gods, as man, and as the universe. The Incarnation is the play of the 










Absolute as man. Do you know how the Absolute plays as man? It is like the rushing down of water 










from a big roof through a pipe; the power of Satchidananda-nay, Satchidananda Itself-descends 










through the conduit of a human form as water descends through the pipe. Only twelve sages, 










Bharadvaja and the others, recognized Rama as an Incarnation of God. Not everyone can recognize 










an Incarnation. 



















"It is God alone who incarnates Himself as man to teach people the ways of love and 










knowledge. Well, what do you think of me? 



















"Once my father went to Gaya. There Raghuvir said to him in a dream, 'I shall be born as 










your son.' Thereupon my father said to Him: '0 Lord, I am a poor brahmin. How shall I be able to 










serve You?' 'Don't worry about it', Raghuvir replied. 'It will be taken care of.' 



















"My sister, Hriday's mother, used to worship my feet with flowers and sandal-paste. One 










day I placed my foot on her head and said to her, 'You will die in Benares.' 



















"Once Mathur Babu said to me: 'Father, there is nothing inside you but God. Your body is 










like an empty shell. It may look from outside like a pumpkin, but inside there is nothing-neither 










flesh nor seed. Once I saw you as someone moving with a veil on.' 



















MASTER'S VISION OF GAURANGA 



















(To M.) "I am shown everything beforehand. Once I saw Gauranga and his devotees singing 










kirtan in the Panchavati. I think I saw Balaram there and you too. 



















"I wanted to know the experiences of Gauranga and was shown them at Syambazar in our 










native district. A crowd gathered; they even climbed the trees and the walls; they stayed with me 










day and night. For seven days I had no privacy whatever. Thereupon I said to the Divine Mother, 










'Mother, I have had enough of it.' 



















"I am at peace now. I shall have to be born once more. Therefore I am not giving all 










knowledge to my companions. (With a smile) Suppose I give you all knowledge; will you then come 










to me again so willingly? 



















"I recognized you on hearing you read the Chaitanya Bhagavat. You are my own. The same 










substance, like father and son. All of you are coming here again. When you pull one part of the 










kalmi creeper, all the branches come toward you. You are all relatives-like brothers. Suppose 










Rakhal, Harish, and the others had gone to Puri, and you were there too. Would you live 










separately? 



















PARABLE OF THE GRASS-EATING TIGER 



















"Before you came here, you didn't know who you were. Now you will know. It is God who, 










as the guru, makes one know. 



















"Nangta told the story of the tigress and the herd of goats. Once a tigress attacked a herd of 










goats. A hunter saw her from a distance and killed her. The tigress was 





































pregnant and gave birth to a cub as she expired. The cub began to grow in the company of 










the goats. At first it was nursed by the she-goats, and later on, as it grew bigger, it began to eat 










grass and bleat like the goats. Gradually the cub became a big tiger; but still it ate grass and 










bleated. When atached by other animals, it would run away, like the goats. One day a 










fierce-looking tiger attacked the herd. It was amazed to see a tiger in the herd eating grass and 










running away with the goats at its approach. 



















It lef the goats and caught hold of the grass-eating tiger, which began to bleat and tried to 










run away. But the fierce tiger dragged it to the water and said: 'Now look at your face in the water. 










You see, you have the pot-face of a tiger; it is exactly like mine.' Next it pressed a piece of meat 










into its mouth. At first the grass-eating tiger refused to eat the meat. Then it got the taste of the 










meat and relished it. At last the fierce tiger said to the grass-eater: 'What a disgrace! You lived with 










goats and ate grass like them!' And the other was really ashamed of itself. 



















"Eating grass is like enjoying 'woman and gold'. To bleat and run away like a goat is to 










behave like an ordinary man. Going away with the new tiger is like taking shelter with the guru, 










who awakens one's spiritual consciousness, and recognizing him alone as one's relative. To see 










one's face rightly is to know one's real Self." 



















Sri Ramakrishna stood up. There was silence all around, distrubed only the by the gentle 










rustling of the pine-needless and the murmuring of the Ganges. The Master went to the 










Panchavati and then to his room, talking all the while with M. The disciple followed him, 










fascinated. At the Panchavati Sri Ramakrishan touched with his forehead the raised platform 










around the banyan-tree. This was the place of his intense spiritual discipline, where he had wept 










bitterly for the vision of the Divine Mother, where he had held intimate communion with Her, and 










where he had seen many divine forms. 



















The maser and M. passed the cluster of bakul-tress and came to the nahabat. Hazara awas 










there. The master said to him:" Don't eat too much, and give up this craze for outer cleanliness. 










People with a craze do not attain Knowledge. Follow conventions only as much as necessary. Don't 










go to excess." The Master entered his room and sat on the couch. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was resting after his midday meal when Surendra, Ram, and other 










devotees arrived from Calcutta. It was about one o'clock. While M. was strolling alone under the 










pine-tress, Harish came there and told him that the Master wanted him in his room. Someone was 










going to read from the 'Siva Samhita, a book containing instructions about yoga and six centres. 



















M. entered the room and saluted the Master. The devotees were seated on the floor, but 










no one was reading the book. Sri Ramakrishna was talking to the devotees. 



















MASTER:"The gopis cherished escstatic love for Krishna. There are two elements in such 










love: 'l-ness' and 'my-ness'. 'l-ness' is the feeling that Krishna will be ill if T do not serve Him. In 










this attitude the devotee does not look upon his Ideal as God. 



















"'My-ness' is to feel that the Beloved is 'my' own. The gopis had such a feeling of 'myness' 










toward Krishna that they would place their subtle bodies under His feet lest His soles should get 










hurt. 





































"Yasoda remarked: 'I don't understand your Chintamani Krishna. To me He is simply 










Gopala.' The gopis also said: 'Oh, where is Krishna, our Beloved? Where is Krishna, our 










Sweetheart?' They were not conscious of His being God. 



















"It is like a small child saying 'my daddy'. If someone says to the child, 'No, he is not your 










daddy', the child says, 'Yes, he is my daddy.' 



















GOD, INCARNATED AS MAN, ACTS LIKE A MAN 



















"God, incarnating Himself as man, behave exactly like a man. That is why it is difficult to 










recognize an Incarnation. When God becomes man, He is exactly like man. He has the same 










hunger, thirst, disease, grief, and sometimes even fear. Rama was stricken with grief for Sita. 










Krishna carried on His head the shoes and wooden stool of His father Nanda. 



















"In the theatre, when an actor comes on the stage in the role of a holy man, he behaves like 










one, and not like the actor who is taking the part of the king. He plays his own role. 



















"Once an impersonator dressed himself as a world-renouncing monk. Pleased with the 










correctness of his disguise, some rich people offered him a rupee. He did not accept the money 










but went away shaking his head. Afterwards he removed his disguise and appeared in his usual 










dress. Then he said to the rich people, 'Please give me the rupee.' They replied: 'Why, you went 










away refusing our present. Why do you ask for it now?' The man said: 'But then I was in the role of 










a holy man. I could not accept money.' Likewise, when God becomes man He behaves exactly like 










a man. 



















"At Vrindavan one sees many places associated with Krishna's life." 



















SURENDRA: "We were there during the holidays. Visitors were continually pestered for 










money. The priests and others asked for it continually. We told them that we were going to leave 










for Calcutta the next day, but we fled from Vrindavan that very night." 



















MASTER: "What is that? Shame! You said you would leave the place the next day and ran 










away that very day. What a shame!" 



















SURENDRA (embarrassed): "Here and there we saw the babajis in the woods practising 










spiritual discipline in solitude." 



















MASTER: "Did you give them anything?" 



















SURENDRA: "No, sir." 



















MASTER: "That was not proper of you. One should give something to monks and devotees. 










Those who have the means should help such persons when they meet them. 



















MASTER'S REMINISCENCES OF MATHURA AND VRINDAVAN 



















"I went to Vrindavan with Mathur Babu. The moment I came to the Dhruva Ghat at 










Mathura, in a flash I saw Vasudeva crossing the Jamuna with Krishna in his arms. 





































"One evening I was taking a stroll on the beach of the river. There were small thatched huts 










on the beach and big plum-trees. It was the 'cow-dust' hour. The cows were returning from the 










pasture, raising dust with their hoofs. I saw them fording the river. 



















Then came some cowherd boys crossing the river with their cows. No sooner did I behold 










this scene than I cried out, '0 Krishna, whre are You?' and becam unconscious. 



















"I wanted to visit Syamakunda and Radhakunda; so Mathur Babu sent me there in a 










palanquin. We had a long way to go. Food was put in the palanquin. While going over the meadow 










I was overpowerd with emotion and wept: '0 Krishna, I find everything the same; only You are not 










here. This is the very meadow where You tended the cows.' Hriday followed me on foot. I was 










bathed in tears. I couldn't ask the bearers to stop the palanquin. 



















"At Syamakunda and Radhakunda I saw the holy men living in small mud huts. Facing away 










from the road lest their eyes should fall on men, they were engaged in spiritual discipline. One 










should visit the 'Twelve Grove'. 



















"I went in to samdhi at the sight of the image of Bankuvihari. In that state I wanted to touch 










it. I did not want to visit Govindaji twice. At Mathura I dreamt of Krishna as the cowherd boy. 










Hriday dnd Mathur Babu had the same dream. 



















(To Surendra) "You have both- yoga and bhoga. There are different classes of sages: the 










brahmarshi, the devarshi, and the rajarshi. Sukadeva is an example of the brahmarshi. He didn't 










keep even one book with him. An example of the devarhi is Narada. Janaka was a rajarshi, devoted 










to selfless work. 



















"The devotee of the Divine Mother attains dharma and moksha. He enjoys artha and kama 










as well. Once I saw you in a vision as the child of the Divine Mother. You have both- yoga and 










bhoga; otherwise your countenance would look dry. 



















"The man who renounces all looks dry. Once I saw a devotee of the Divine Mother at the 










bathing-ghat on the Ganges. He was eating his meal and at the same time worhipping the Mother. 










He looked on himself as the Mother's child. 



















"But it isn't good to have much money. I find that Jadu Mallick is drowned in worldliness. It 










is because he has too much money. Nabin Niyogi, too, has both yoga and bhoga. I saw him and his 










son waving the fan before the image of the Divine Mother at the time of the Durga Puja." 



















SURENDRA:"Sir, why can't I meditate?" 



















MASTER:"You remember God and think of Him, don't you?" 



















SURENDRA:"Yes, sir. I go to sleep repeating the word 'Mother'." 



















MASTER:"That is very good. It will be enough if you remember God and think of Him." 



















Sri Ramakrishna had taken Surendra's responsibilities on himself. Why should Surendra 










worry about anything? 





































It was evening. The Master was sitting on the floor of this room with the devotees. He was 










talking to them about yoga and the six centes. These are described in the Siva Samhita. 



















MASTER:" Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna are the three principal nerves. All the lotuses are 










located in the Sushumna. They are formed of Consciousness, like a tree made of wax-the branches, 










twigs, fruits, and so forth all of wax. The Kundalini lies in the lotus of the Muladhara. That lotus has 










four petals. The Primordial Energy resides in all bodies as the Kundalini. She is like a sleeping snake 










coiled up-'of the form of a sleeping snake, having the Muladhara for Her abode'. (To M.) The 










Kundalini is speedily awakened if one follows the path of bhakti. God cannot be seen unless She is 










awakened. Sing earnestly and secretly in solitude: 



















Waken, Mother! Kundalini, whose nature is Bliss Eternal! Thou art the serpent coiled in 










sleep, in the lotus of the Muladhara. 



















"Ramprasad achieved perfection through singing. One obtains the vision of God if one sings 










with yearning heart." 



















M: "Grief and distress of mind disappear if one has these experiences but once." 



















PROPER TIME FOR SPIRITUAL UNFOLDMENT 



















MASTER: "That is true. Distress of mind disappears for ever. I shall tell you a few things 










about yoga. But you see, the mother bird doesn't break the shell until the chick inside the egg is 










matured. The egg is hatched in the fullness of time. It is necessary to practise some spiritual 










discipline. The guru no doubt does everything for the disciple; but at the end he makes the disciple 










work a little himself. When cutting down a big tree, a man cuts almost through the trunk; then he 










stands aside for a moment, and the tree falls down with a crash. 



















"The farmer brings water to his field through a canal from the river. He stands aside when 










only a little digging remains to be done to connect the field with the water. Then the earth 










becomes soaked and falls of itself, and the water of the river pours into the canal in torrents. 



















"A man is able to see God as soon as he gets rid of ego and other limitations. He sees God as 










soon as he is free from such feelings as 'I am a scholar', 'I am the son of such and such a person', 'I 










am wealthy', 'I am honourable', and so forth. 



















'"God alone is real and all else unreal; the world is illusory' -that is discrimination. One 










cannot assimilate spiritual instruction without discrimination. 



















"Through the practice of spiritual discipline one attains perfection, by the grace of God. But 










one must also labour a little. Then one sees God and enjoys bliss. If a man hears that a jar filled 










with gold is buried at a certain place, he rushes there and begins to dig. He sweats as he goes on 










digging. After much digging he feels the spade strike something. Then he throws away the spade 










and looks for the jar. At the sight of the jar he dances for joy. Then he takes up the jar and pours 










out the gold coins. He takes them into his hand, counts them, and feels the ecstasy of joy. 










Vision-touch- enjoyment. Isn't it so?" 





































M: "Yes, sir." 





































The Master was silent a moment and then went on. 



















MASTER: "Those who are my own will come here even if I scold them. Look at Narendra's 










nature! At first he used to abuse my Mother Kali very much. One day I said to him sharply, 'Rascal! 










Don't come here any more.' 



















He slowly left the room and prepared a smoke. He who is one's own will not be angry even 










if scolded. What do you say?" 



















M: "That is true, sir." 



















MASTER: "Narendra is perfect from his very birth. He is devoted to the ideal of the formless 



















God." 



















M. (smiling): "Whenever he comes here he brings along great excitement." 










Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said, "Yes, excitement indeed." 



















The following day was Tuesday, the ekadasi day of the lunar fortnight. It was eleven o'clock 










in the morning and the Master had not yet taken his meal. M., Rakhal, and other devotees were 










sitting in the Master's room. 



















MASTER (to M.): "One should fast on the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight. That purifies 










the mind and helps one to develop love of God. Isn't that so?" 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "But you may take milk and puffed rice. Don't you think so?" 



















M. AT DAKSHINESWAR (II) 



















December 26, 1883 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA, accompanied by Manilal Mallick, M., and several other devotees, was in 










a carriage on his way to Ram's new garden. 



















The garden, which Ram had recently purchased, was next to Surendra's. Ram adored the 










Master as an Incarnation of God. He visited Sri Ramakrishna frequently at Dakshineswar. Manilal 










Mallick was a member of the Brahmo Samaj. The Brahmos do not believe in Divine Incarnations. 



















MASTER (to Manilal): "In order to meditate on God, one should try at first to think of Him as 










free from upadhis, limitations. God is beyond upadhis. He is beyond speech and mind. But it is very 










difficult to achieve perfection in this form of meditation. 



















"But it is easy to meditate on an Incarnation-God born as man. Yes, God in man. The body is 










a mere covering. It is like a lantern with a light burning inside, or like a glass case in which one sees 










precious things." 



















Arriving at the garden, the Master got out of the carriage and accompanied Ram and the 










other devotees to the sacred tulsi-grove. Standing near it, he said: "How nice! It is a fine place. 










You can easily meditate on God here." 





































Sri Ramakrishna sat down in the house, which stood to the south of the lake. Ram offered 










him a plate of fruit and sweets which he enjoyed with the devotees. After a short time he went 










around the garden. 



















Next Sri Ramakrishna proceeded toward Surendra's garden. He walked on foot a little 










distance and saw a sadhu sitting on a couch under a tree. At once he went up to the holy man and 










joyfully began a conversation with him. 



















MASTER: "To which order of monks do you belong? Have you any title-Giri, Puri, or the 



















like?" 



















SADHU: "People call me a paramahamsa." 










Brahman and Sakti identical 



















MASTER: "That is good. 'I am Siva'-that is a good attitude. But I must tell you something 










else. The process of creation, preservation, and destruction that is going on day and night is due 










to Sakti, the Power of God. This Primal Power and Brahman are one and the same. Sakti cannot 










exist without Brahman, just as waves cannot exist without water. There cannot be any 










instrumental music without an instrument. 



















"As long as God keeps us in His relative world, so long we feel that there are two. If one 










accepts Sakti, one accepts Brahman as well. If one is aware of night, one is also aware of day. If 










one is aware of knowledge, one is also aware of ignorance. 



















"But there is another state in which God reveals to His devotee that Brahman is beyond 










both knowledge and ignorance. It cannot be described in words. What exists, exists." 



















After a pleasant conversation with the sadhu, the Master returned to the carriage, the holy 










man walking with him. Sri Ramakrishna looked upon him as a friend of long acquaintance, and 










they walked arm in arm. 



















The Master arrived at Surendra's garden. The very first thing he talked about was the sadhu. 



















MASTER: "He is a very nice man. (To Ram) Bring him to Dakshineswar when you come. He is 










really a good man. There is a line in a song to the effect that a man cannot recognize a holy person 










unless he is holy himself. 



















MANY FORMS OF DIVINE MANIFESTATION 



















"The sadhu believes in God without form. That is good. God is both formless and endowed 










with form. He is many things more. The Absolute and the Relative belong to one and the same 










Reality. What is beyond speech and mind is born in the flesh, assuming various forms and engaging 










in various activities. From that one Om have sprung 'Om Siva', 'Om Kali', and 'Om Krishna'. 










Suppose the master of a house has sent out a small boy of the family to invite people to a feast. All 










look on the boy with great fondness and affection because he is the son or grandson of a 










prominent man." 





































The Master took refreshments at Surendra's garden house and then set out for 










Dakshineswar with the devotees. 



















Thursday, December 27, 1883 



















The temple garden was filled with the sweet music of the dawn service; which mingled with 










the morning melody from the nahabat. Leaving his bed, Sri Ramakrishna chanted the names of 










God in sweet tones. Then he bowed before the pictures of the different deities in his room and 










went to the west porch to salute the Ganges. 



















Some of the devotees who had spent the night at the temple garden came to the Master's 










room and bowed before him. Rakhal was staying with the Master, and Baburam had come the 










previous evening. M. had been staying there two weeks. 



















Sri Ramakrishna said to M.: "I have been invited to Ishan's this morning. Baburam will 










accompany me, and you too." M. made ready to go with the Master. 



















At eight o'clock the carriage hired for the Master stood waiting in front of the nahabat. On 










all sides plants and trees were in flower, and the river sparkled in the sunlight of the bright 










winter's day. The Master bowed once more before the pictures. Then, still chanting the name of 










the Divine Mother, he got into the carriage, followed by M. and 



















Baburam. The devotees took with them Sri Ramakrishna's woolen shawl, woolen cap, and 










small bag of spices. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was very happy during the trip and enjoyed it like a child. About nine 










o'clock the carriage stopped at the door of Ishan's house. 



















Ishan and his relatives greeted the Master and led him to the parlour on the first floor. 










Shrish, Ishan's son, was introduced to Sri Ramakrishna. The young man practised law at Alipur. He 










had been a brilliant student, having stood first in two of the university examinations, but he was 










extremely modest. 



















MASTER (to Shrish): "What is your profession?" 



















SHRISH: "I am practising law at Alipur." 



















MASTER (to M.): "For such a man to be a lawyer! (To Shrish) Well, have you any questions 










to ask? Perhaps you want to know how to live unattached in the world. Isn't that so?" 



















SHRISH: "Under the pressure of duties people do many unrighteous things in the world. 










Further, some are engaged in good work, and some in evil. Is this due to their actions in previous 










births? Is that why they act this way?" 



















DUTIES AND CEREMONIAL DEVOTIONS 



















MASTER: "How long should a man perform his duties? As long as he has not attained God. 










Duties drop away after the realization of God. Then one goes beyond good and evil. The flower 










drops off as soon as the fruit appears. The flower serves the purpose of begetting the fruit. 





































"How long should a devotee perform daily devotions such as the sandhya? As long as his 










hair does not stand on end and his eyes do not shed tears at the name of God. These things 










indicate that the devotee has realized God. From these one knows that he has attained pure love 










of God. Realizing God one goes beyond virtue and vice. 



















I bow my head, says Prasad, before desire and liberation; Knowing the secret that Kali is one 










with the highest Brahman, I have discarded, once for all, both righteousness and sin. 



















"The more you advance toward God, the less He will give you worldly duties to perform." 



















SHRISH: "It is extremely difficult to proceed toward God while leading the life of a 










householder." 



















PRACTICE OF GOD-COMMUNION 



















MASTER: "Why so? What about the yoga of practice? At Kamarpukur I have seen the 










women of the carpenter families selling flattened rice. Let me tell you how alert they are while 










doing their business. The pestle of the husking-machine that flattens the paddy 



















constantly falls into the hole of the mortar. The woman turns the paddy in the hole with 










one hand and with the other holds her baby on her lap as she nurses it. In the mean time 










customers arrive. The machine goes on pounding the paddy, and she carries on her bargains with 










the customers'. She says to them, 'Pay the few pennies you owe me before you take anything 










more.' You see, she has all these things to do at the same time-nurse the baby, turn the paddy as 










the pestle pounds it, take the flattened rice out of the hole, and talk to the buyers. This is called 










the yoga of practice. Fifteen parts of her mind out of sixteen are fixed on the pestle of the 










husking-machine, lest it should pound her hand. With only one part of her mind she nurses the 










baby and talks to the buyers. Likewise, he who leads the life of a householder should devote 










fifteen parts of his mind to God; otherwise he will face ruin and fall into the clutches of Death. He 










should perform the duties of the world with only one part of his mind. 



















"A man may lead the life of a householder after attaining Knowledge. But he must attain 










Knowledge first. If the milk of the mind is kept in the water of the world, they get mixed. 










Therefore he should turn the milk into curd and extract butter from it by churning it in solitude; 










then he may keep the butter in the water of the world. Therefore, you see, spiritual discipline is 










necessary. When the Aswattha tree is a mere sapling, it must be enclosed by a fence; otherwise 










the cattle will eat it. But the fence may be taken away when the trunk grows thick and strong. 










Then even an elephant tied to the tree cannot harm it. 



















NECESSITY OF SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE 



















"Therefore at the beginning the aspirant should go into solitude now and then. Spiritual 










discipline is necessary. You want to eat rice; suppose you sit down somewhere and say, 'Wood 










contains fire and fire cooks rice.' Can saying it cook the rice? You must get two pieces of wood and 










by rubbing them together bring out the fire. 





































"By eating siddhi one becomes intoxicated and feels happy. But suppose you haven't eaten 










the stuff or done anything else with it; you simply sit down somewhere and mutter, 'Siddhi! 










siddhi!' Will that intoxicate you or make you happy? 



















"You may learn a great deal from books; but it is all futile if you have no love for God and no 










desire to realize Him. A mere pundit, without discrimination and renunciation, has his attention 










fixed on 'woman and gold'. The vulture soars very high but its eyes are fixed on the charnel-pit. 



















"That alone is knowledge through which one is able to know God. All else is futile. Well, 










what is your idea about God?" 



















SHRISH: "Sir, I feel that there is an All-knowing Person. We get an indication of His 










Knowledge by looking at His creation. Let me give an illustration. God has made devices to keep 










fish and other aquatic animals alive in cold regions. As water grows colder, it gradually shrinks. 










But the amazing thing is that, just before turning into ice, the water becomes light and expands. In 










the freezing cold, fish can easily live in the water of a lake: the surface of the lake may be frozen, 










but the water below is all liquid. If a very cool breeze blows, it is obstructed by the ice. The water 










below remains warm." 



















MASTER: "That God exists may be known by looking at the universe. But it is one thing to 










hear of God, another thing to see God, and still another thing to talk to God. Some have heard of 










milk, some have seen it, and some, again, have tasted it. You feel happy when you see milk; you 










are nourished and strengthened when you drink it. You will get peace of mind only when you have 










seen God. You will enjoy bliss and gain strength only when you have talked to Him." 



















SHRISH: "We do not have time to pray to God." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "That is true. Nothing comes to pass except at the right time. Going 










to bed, a child said to his mother, 'Mother, please wake me up when I feel the call of nature.' 'My 










son,' said the mother, 'that urge itself will wake you up. I don't have to wake you.' 



















"It is all decided beforehand by God what each one shall receive. A mother-in-law used to 










measure rice with a dish for her daughters-in-law. But it was not enough for them. One day the 










dish was broken and that made the girls happy. But the mother-in-law said to them, 'Children, you 










may shout and dance, but I can measure the rice with the palm of my hand.' 



















SELF-SURRENDER TO GOD 



















(To Shrish): "Surrender everything at the feet of God. What else can you do? Give Him the 










power of attorney. Let Him do whatever He thinks best. If you rely on a great man, he will never 










injure you. 



















ILLUSTRATION OF MONKEY AND KITTEN 



















"It is no doubt necessary to practise spiritual discipline; but there are two kinds of aspirants. 










The nature of the one kind is like that of the young monkey, and the nature of the other kind is like 










that of the kitten. The young monkey, with great exertion, somehow clings to its mother. 










Likewise, there are some aspirants who think that in order to realize God they must repeat His 





































name a certain number of times, meditate on Him for a certain period, and practise a certain 










amount of austerity. An aspirant of this kind makes his own efforts to catch hold of God. But the 










kitten, of itself, cannot cling to its mother. It lies on the ground and cries, 'Mew, mew!' It leaves 










everything to its mother. The mother cat sometimes puts it on a bed, sometimes on the roof 










behind a pile of wood. She carries the kitten in her mouth hither and thither. The kitten doesn't 










know how to cling to the mother. Likewise, there are some aspirants who cannot practise spiritual 










discipline by calculating about japa or the period of meditation. All that they do is cry to God with 










yearning hearts. God hears their cry and cannot keep Himself away. He reveals Himself to them." 



















At noon the host wished to feed the Master and the devotees. Sri Ramakrishna was 










smilingly pacing the room. Now and then he exchanged a few words with the musician. 



















MUSICIAN: "It is God alone who is both the 'instrument' and the 'cause'. Duryodhana said to 










Krishna: '0 Lord, Thou art seated in my heart. I act as Thou makest me act.'" 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Yes, that is true. It is God alone who acts through us. He is the 










Doer, undoubtedly, and man is His instrument. But it is also true that an action cannot fail to 










produce its result. Your stomach will certainly burn if you eat hot chilli. It is God who has ordained 










that chilli will burn your stomach. If you commit a sin, you must bear its fruit. But one who has 










attained perfection, realized God, cannot commit sin. An expert singer cannot sing a false note. 










A man with a trained voice sings the notes correctly: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni." 



















The meal was ready. The Master and the devotees went to the inner court, where they 










were treated to a generous feast. 



















About three o'clock in the afternoon the Master was seated again in Ishan's drawing-room 










with M. and Shrish. He resumed his conversation with Shrish. 



















MASTER: "What is your attitude toward God? 'I am He', or 'Master and servant'? For the 










householder it is very good to look on God as the Master. The householder is conscious of doing 










the duties of life himself. Under such conditions how can he say, 'I am He'? To him who says, 'I am 










He' the world appears to be a dream. His mind, his body, even his ego, are dreams to him. 










Therefore he cannot perform worldly duties. So it is very good for the householder to look on 










himself as the servant and on God as the Master. 



















"Hanuman had the attitude of a servant. He said to Rama: '0 Rama, sometimes I meditate 










on You as the whole and on myself as the part. Sometimes I feel that You are the Master and I am 










the servant. But when I have the Knowledge of Reality, I see that I am You and You are I.' 



















"In the state of Perfect Knowledge one may feel, 'I am He'; but that is far beyond the 










ordinary man's experience." 



















SHRISH: "That is true, sir. The attitude of a servant relieves a man of all his worries. The 










servant depends entirely upon his master. A dog is devoted to its master. It depends upon him and 










is at peace." 





































GOD WITH FORM AND THE FORMLESS DEITY 



















MASTER: "Well, what suits your taste-God with form or the formless Reality? But to tell you 










the truth, He who is formless is also endowed with form. To His bhaktas He reveals Himself as 










having a form. It is like a great ocean, an infinite expanse of water, without any trace of shore. 










Here and there some of the water has been frozen. Intense cold has turned it into ice. Just so, 










under the cooling influence, so to speak, of the bhakta's love, the Infinite appears to take a form. 










Again, the ice melts when the sun rises; it becomes water as before. Just so, one who follows the 










path of knowledge - the path of discrimination - does not see the form of God any more. To him 










everything is formless. 



















The ice melts into formless water with the rise of the Sun of Knowledge. But mark this: form 










and formlessness belong to one and the same Reality." 



















At dusk the Master was ready to start for Dakshineswar. He stood on the south porch of the 










drawing-room, talking to Ishan. Someone remarked that the chanting of God's holy name did not 










always produce results. Ishan said: "How can you say that? The seeds of an Aswattha tree are no 










doubt tiny, but in them lie the germs of big trees. It may take a very long time for them to grow." 



















"Yes, Yes!" said the Master. "It takes a long time to see the effect." 



















Next to Ishan's was his father-in-law's house. Sri Ramakrishna stood at the door of this 










house, ready to get into the carriage. Ishan and his friends stood around to bid him adieu. Sri 










Ramakrishna said to Ishan: "You are living in the world as a mudfish lives in the mud. It lives in the 










mud but its body is not stained. 



















"There are both vidya and avidya in this world of maya. Who may be called a 










paramahamsa? He who, like a swan, can take the milk from a mixture of milk and water, leaving 










aside the water. He who, like an ant, can take the sugar from a mixture of sugar and sand, leaving 










aside the sand." 



















It was evening. The Master stopped at Ram's house on his way to Dakshineswar. He was 










taken to the drawing-room and there he engaged in conversation with Mahendra Goswami. 










Mahendra belonged to the Vaishnava sect and was Ram's neighbour. Sri Ramakrishna was fond of 










him. 



















MASTER: "The worshippers of Vishnu and the worshippers of Sakti will all ultimately reach 










one and the same goal; the ways may be different. The true Vaishnavas do not criticize the 










Saktas." 



















GOSWAMI (smiling): "Siva and Parvati are our Father and Mother." Sri Ramakrishna, out of 










his stock of a dozen English words, said sweetly, "Thank you!" Then he added, "Yes, Father and 










Mother!" 



















GOSWAMI: "Besides, it is a sin to criticize anyone, especially a devotee of God. All sins may 










be forgiven, but not the sin of criticizing a devotee." 



















MASTER: "But this idea of sin does not by any means affect all. For instance, the Isvarakotis, 










such as Incarnations of God, are above sin. Sri Chaitanya is an example. 





































"A child, walking on a narrow ridge and holding to his father, may slip into the ditch. But 










that can never happens if the father holds the child by the hand. 



















THE MASTER'S PRAYER FOR PURE LOVE 



















"Listen. I prayed to the Divine Mother for pure love. I said to Her: 'Here is Thy 










righteousness, here is Thy unrighteousness. Take them both and give me pure love for Thee. 










Here is Thy purity, here is Thy impurity. Take them both and give me pure love 



















for Thee. Mother, here is Thy virtue, here is Thy vice. Take them both and give me pure 










love for Thee.' " 



















GOSWAMI: "Yes, sir. That is right." 



















UNSWERVING DEVOTION TO GOD 



















MASTER: "You should undoubtedly bow before all views. But there is a thing called 










unswerving devotion to one ideal. True, you should salute everyone. But you must love one ideal 










with your whole soul. That is unswerving devotion. 



















"Hanuman could not take delight in any other form than that of Rama. The gopis had such 










single-minded love for the cowherd Krishna of Vrindavan that they did not care to see the 










turbaned Krishna of Dwaraka. 



















"A wife may serve her husband's brothers by fetching water, or in other ways, but she 










cannot serve them in the way she does her husband. With him she has a special relationship." 



















Ram treated the Master to sweets. Sri Ramakrishna was ready to start for Dakshineswar. 










He put on his woolen shawl and cap, and got into the carriage with M. and the other devotees. 










Ram and his friends saluted the Master. 



















Saturday, December 29, 1883 



















It was the day of the new moon, auspicious for the worship of the Divine Mother. At one 










o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna got into a carriage to visit the temple of Kali at Kalighat. 










He intended to stop at Adhar's house on the way, since Adhar was to accompany him to the 










temple. While the carriage was waiting near the north porch of the Master's room, M. went to the 










Master and said, "Sir, may I also go with you?" 



















MASTER: "Why?" 



















M: "I should like to visit my home in Calcutta." 



















Sri Ramakrishna reflected a moment and said: "Must you go home? Why? You are quite all 










right here." 



















M. wanted to see his people a few hours, but evidently the Master did not approve. 










Sunday, December 30, 1883 





































At three o'clock in the afternoon, while M. was walking up and down under a tree, a 










devotee came to him and said that the Master had sent for him. M. went to Sri Ramakrishna's 










room and found a number of devotees there. He saluted the Master. 



















Ram, Kedar, and others had arrived from Calcutta. Ram had brought with him the Vedantist 










monk whom the Master had visited near his garden a few days earlier. On that occasion Sri 










Ramakrishna had asked him to bring the sadhu to Dakshineswar. 



















The monk was sitting on the small couch with the Master. They were talking happily in 










Hindusthani. 



















MASTER: "What do you feel about all this?" 



















MONK: "It is all like a dream." 



















MASTER: "Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. Well sir, what is Brahman?" 










MONK: "Brahman is the Sound. It is Om." 



















MASTER: "But there must be something indicated by the sound. Isn't that so?" 










MONK: "That Itself is the thing indicated as well as the indicator." 



















At these words Sri Ramakrishna went into samadhi and sat motionless. The monk and the 










devotees looked wonderingly at him in his ecstatic condition. Kedar said to the monk: "Look at 










him, sir. This is samadhi." 



















The monk had read of samadhi but had never seen it before. After a few minutes the 










Master began gradually to come down to the normal plane of consciousness. He said to the Divine 










Mother: "Mother, I want to be normal. Please don't make me unconscious. I should like to talk to 










the sadhu about Satchidananda. Mother, I want to be merry talking about Satchidananda." 



















The monk was amazed to see the Master's condition and to hear these words. Sri 










Ramakrishna said to him: "Please do away with your 'I am He'. Let us now keep T and 'Thou' to 










enjoy the fun." 



















A little later the Master was walking in the Panchavati with Ram, Kedar, M., and the other 










devotees. 



















MASTER (to Kedar, with a smile): "What did you think of the sadhu?" 



















KEDAR: "It is all dry knowledge. The pot has just been put on the fire, but as yet there is no 










rice in it." 



















MASTER: "That may be true. But he has renounced everything. He who has renounced the 










world has already made great progress. The sadhu belongs to the stage of the beginner. Nothing 










can be achieved without the realization of God. When a man is intoxicated with ecstatic love of 










God, he dosn't take delight in anything else. Then Cherish my precious Mother Syama Tenderly 










within, mind; May you and I alone behold Her, Letting no one else intrude." 





































Kedar repeated the words of a song in keeping with the Master's feeling: 



















How shall I open my heart, friend? It is forbidden me to speak. I am about to die, for lack 










of a kindred soul to understand my misery. . . . 



















Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room. About four o'clock the door of the Kali temple was 










opened, and the Master walked to the temple with the monk; M. accompanied them. Entering the 










inner chamber, the Master prostrates himself reverently before the image. The monk, with folded 










hands, also bowed his head repeatedly before Kali. 



















MASTER: "What do you think of Kali?" 



















MONK (with devotion): "Kali is supreme." 



















MASTER: "Kali and Brahman are identical. Is that not so?" 



















MONK: "As long as one's mind is turned to the outer world, one must accept Kali. As long as 










a man sees the outer world, and discriminates between good and evil, he must accept good and 










reject evil. To be sure, all names and forms are illusory; but as long as the mind sees the outer 










world, the aspirant must give up woman. The ideas of good and evil are applied to one who is still 










a student on the path; otherwise he will stray from the path of righteousness. 



















Thus conversing, the Master and the monk returned from the temple. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Did you notice that the sadhu bowed before Kali?" 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















Monday, December 31, 1883 



















At four o'clock in the afternoon the Master was sitting in his room with M., Rakhal, Latu, 










Harish, and other devotees. 



















Addressing M. and Balaram, the Master said: "Haladhari followed the path of knowledge. 










Day and night he used to study the Upanishads, the Adhyatma Ramayana, and similar books on 










Vedanta. He would turn up his nose at the mention of the forms of God. Once I ate from the 










leaf-plates of the beggars. At this Haladhari said to me, 'How will you be able to marry your 










children?' I said: 'You rascal! Shall I ever have children? May your mouth that repeats words from 










the Gita and the Vedanta be blighted!' Just fancy! He declared that the world was illusory and, 










again, would meditate in the temple of Vishnu with turned-up nose." 



















In the evening Balaram and the other devotees returned to Calcutta. The Master remained 










in his room, absorbed in contemplation of the Divine Mother: After a while the sweet music of the 










evening worship in the temples was heard. 



















A little later the Master began to talk to the Mother in a tender voice that touched the 










heart of M., who was seated on the floor. After repeating, "Hari Om! Hari Om! Om!", the Master 










said: "Mother, don't make me unconscious with the Knowledge of Brahman. Mother, I don't want 










Brahmajnana. I want to be merry. I want to play." Again he said: "Mother, I don't know the 










Vedanta; and Mother, I don't even care to know. The Vedas and the Vedanta remain so far below 





































when Thou art realized, Divine Mother!" Then he said: "0 Krishna, I shall say to Thee, 'Eat, my 










Child! Take this, my Child!' Krishna, I shall say to Thee, 'My Child, Thou hast assumed this body 










for my sake.' " 



















Wednesday, January 2, 1884 



















Rakhal , Latu, Harish, Ramlal, and M. had been staying with Sri Ramakrishna at the temple 










garden. About three o'clock in the afternoon M. found the Master on the west porch of his room 










engaged in conversation with a Tantrik devotee. The Tantrik was wearing an ochre cloth. Sri 










Ramakrishna asked M. to sit by his side. Perhaps the Master intended to instruct him through his 










talk with the Tantrik devotee. Mahima Chakravarty had sent the latter to the Master. 



















MASTER (to the Tantrik): "It is a part of the Tantrik discipline to drink wine from a human 










skull. This wine is called 'karana'. Isn't that so?" 



















TANTRIK: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "But I cannot touch wine at all." 



















TANTRIK: "You have spontaneous Divine Bliss. One who enjoys that Bliss wants nothing 



















else." 



















MASTER: "I don't care for japa and austerity. But I have constant remembrance and 










consciousness of God. 



















"Tell me, when they speak of the six centres, what do they mean?" 



















TAN'TRIK: "These are like different holy places. In each of the centres dwell Siva and Sakti. 










One cannot see them with the physical eyes. One cannot take them out by cutting open the body." 



















M. listened silently to the conversation. Looking at him, the Master asked the Tantrik 










devotee, "Can a man attain perfection without the help of a vija mantra, a sacred word from the 










guru?" 



















TANTRIK: "Yes, he can if he has faith-faith in the words of the guru." 










The Master turned to M. and said, drawing his attention, "Faith!" 



















After the Tantrik devotee had taken his leave, Jaygopal Sen, a member of the Brahmo 










Samaj, arrived. The Master talked with him. 



















MASTER (to Jaygopal): "One should not harbour malice toward any person or any opinion. 










The believers in the formless God and the worshippers of God with form are all, without exception, 










going toward God alone. The Jnani, the yogi, the bhakta-all, without exception, are seeking Him 










alone. The follower of the path of knowledge calls Him 'Brahman'. The yogi calls Him 'Atman' or 










'Paramatman'. The bhakta calls Him 'Bhagavan'. Further, it is said that there is the Eternal Lord and 










His Eternal Servant." 



















JAYGOPAL: "How can we know that all paths are true?" 





































MASTER: "A man can reach God if he follows one path rjghtly. Then he can learn about all 










the other paths. It is like reaching the roof by some means or other. Then one is able to climb 










down by the wooden or stone stairs, by a bamboo pole, or even by a rope. 



















"A devotee can know everything when God's grace descends on him. If you but realize Him, 










you will be able to know all about Him. You should somehow meet the master of a house and 










become acquainted with him; then he himself will tell you how many houses he owns and all 










about his gardens and government seurities." 



















HOW TO RECEIVE GOD'S GRACE 



















JAYGOPAL: "How does one receive the grace of God?" 



















MASTER: "Constantly you have to chant the name and glories of God and give up worldly 










thoughts as much as you can. With the greatest effort you may try to bring water into your field 










for your crops, but it may all leak out through holes in the ridges. Then all your efforts to bring the 










water by digging a canal will be futile. 



















"You will feel restless for God when your heart becomes pure and your mind free from 










attachment to the things of the world. Then alone will your prayer reach God. A telegraph wire 










cannot carry messages if it has a break or some other defect. 



















"I used to cry for God all alone, with a longing heart. I used to weep, '0 God, where art 










Thou?' Weeping thus, I would lose all consciousness of the world. My mind would merge in the 










Mahavayu. 



















RENUNCIATION OF WORLDLY ATTACHMENT 



















"How can one attain yoga? By completely renouncing attachment to worldly things. The 










mind must be pure and without blemish, like the telegraph wire that has no defect. 



















UNSELFISH LOVE OF GOD 



















"One must not cherish any desire whatever. The devotion of a man who has any desire is 










selfish. But desireless devotion is love for its own sake. You may love me or not, but I love you: this 










is love for its own sake. 



















"The thing is that one must love God. Through intense love one attains the vision of Him. 










The attraction of the husband for the chaste wife, the attraction of the child for its mother, the 










attraction of worldly possessions for the worldly man-when a man can blend these three into one, 










and direct it all to God, then he gets the vision of God." 



















Jaygopal was a man of the world. Was this why the Master gave instruction suited to him? 



















At eight o'clock that evening the Master was sitting in his room with Rakhal and M. It was 










the twenty-first day of M.'s stay with Sri Ramakrishna. The Master had forbidden him to indulge in 










reasoning. 





































FUTILITY OF REASONING 



















MASTER (to Rakhal): "It is not good to reason too much. First comes God, and then the 










world. Realize God first; then you will know all about His world. (To M. and Rakhal ) If first one is 










introduced to Jadu Mallick, then one can know everything about him-the number of his houses, 










gardens, government securities, and so on. For this reason the rishi Narada advised Valmikil to 










repeat the word 'mara'. 'Ma' means God, and 'ra' the world. First comes God, and then the world. 










Krishnakishore said that the word 'mara' is a holy mantra because it was given to Valmiki by the 










rishi. 'Ma' means God, and 'ra' the world. 



















"Therefore, like Valmiki, one should at first renounce everything and cry to God in solitude 










with a longing heart. The first thing necessary is the vision of God; then comes reasoning-about the 










scriptures and the world. 



















(To M.) "That is why I have been telling you not to reason any more. I came from the 










pine-grove to say that to you. Through too much reasoning your spiritual life will be injured; you 










will at last become like Hazra. I used to roam at night in the streets, all alone, and cry to the Divine 










Mother, '0 Mother, blight with Thy thunderbolt my desire to reason!' Tell me that you won't 










reason any more." 



















M: "Yes, sir. I won't reason any more." 



















MASTER: "Everything can be achieved through bhakti alone. Those who want the 










Knowledge of Brahman will certainly achieve that also by following the trail of bhakti. 



















"Can a man blessed with the grace of God ever lack Knowledge? At Kamarpukur I have seen 










grain-dealers measuring paddy. As one heap is measured away another heap is pushed forward to 










be measured. The Mother supplies the devotees with the 'heap' of Knowledge. . 



















"After attaining God, one looks on a pundit as mere straw and dust. Padmalochan said to 










me: 'What does it matter if I accompany you to a meeting at the house of a fisherman? With you I 










can dine even at the house of a pariah.' 



















"Everything can be realized simply through love of God. If one is able to love God, one does 










not lack anything. Kartika and Ganesa were seated near Bhagavati, who had a necklace of gems 










around Her neck. The Divine Mother said to them, 'I will present this necklace to him who is the 










first to go around the universe.' Thereupon Kartika, without losing a moment, set out on the 










peacock, his carrier. Ganesa, on the other hand, in a 



















leisurely fashion went around the Divine Mother and prostrated himself before Her. He 










knew that She contained within Herself the entire universe. The Divine Mother was pleased with 










him and put the necklace around his neck. After a long while Kartika returned and found his 










brother seated there with the necklace on. 



















THE MASTER'S VISIONS 



















"Weeping, I prayed to the Mother: '0 Mother, reveal to me what is contained in the Vedas 










and the Vedanta. Reveal to me what is in the Purana and the Tantra.' One by one She has revealed 










all these to me. 





































"Yes, She has taught me everything. Oh, how many things she has shown me! One day She 










showed me Siva and Sakti everywhere. Everywhere I saw the comunion of Siva and Sakti. Siva and 










Sakti existing in all living things-men, animals, trees, plants. I saw them in the communion of all 










male and female elements. 



















"Another day I was shown heaps of human heads, mountain high. Nothing else existed, and 










I was seated alone in their midst. 



















"Still another day She showed me an ocean. Taking the form of a salt doll, I was going to 










measure its depth. While doing this, through the grace of the guru I was turned to stone. Then I 










saw a ship and at once got into it. 



















The helmsman was the guru. I hope you pray every day to Satchidananda, who is the Guru. 










Do you?" 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "The guru was the helmsman in that boat. I saw that T and 'you' were two 










different things. Again I jumped into the ocean, and was changed into a fish. I found myself 










swimming joyfully in the Ocean of Satchidananda. 



















"These are all deep mysteries. What can you understand through reasoning? You will realize 










everything when God Himself teaches you. Then you will not lack any knowledge." 



















Friday, January 4, 1884 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room. M. was still staying with the Master, devoting his 










time to the practice of spiritual discipline. He had been spending a great part of each day in prayer 










and meditation under the bel-tree, where the Master had performed great austerities and had 










seen many wonderful visions of God. 



















MASTER EXHORTS M. NOT TO REASON & DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TOWARD GOD 



















MASTER (to M.): "Don't reason any more. In the end, reasoning only injures the aspirant. 










One should assume a particular attitude toward God while praying to Him-the attitude of friend or 










servant or son or 'hero'. 



















"I assume the attitude of a child. To me every woman is my mother. The divine Maya, 










seeing this attitude in an aspirant, moves away from his path out of sheer shame. 



















"The attitude of 'hero' is extremely difficult. The Saktas and the Bauls among the Vaishnavas 










follow it, but it is very hard to keep one's spiritual life pure in that attitude. One can assume other 










attitudes toward God as well the attitude in which the devotee serenely contemplates God as the 










Creator, the attitude of service to Him, the attitude of friendship, the attitude of motherly 










affection, or the attitude of conjugal love. The conjugal relationship, the attitude of a woman to 










her husband or sweetheart, contains all the rest-serenity, service, friendship, and motherly 










affection. (To M.) Which one of these appeals to your mind?" 





































M: "I like them all." 





































MASTER: "When one attains perfection one takes delight in all these relationships. In that 










state a devotee has not the slightest trace of lust. The holy books of the Vaishnavas speak of 










Chandidas and the washerwoman. Their love was entirely free from lust. 



















"In that state a devotee looks on himself as a woman. He does not regard himself as a man. 










Sanatana Goswami refused to see Mirabai because she was a woman. Mira informed him that at 










Vrindavan the only man was Krishna and that all others were His handmaids. 'Was it right of 










Sanatana to think of himself as a man?' Mira inquired." 



















MASTER AND THE BRAHMO SAMAJ 



















At dusk M. was sitting at the Master's feet. Sri Ramakrishna had been told that Keshab's 










illness had taken a turn for the worse. He was talking about Keshab and incidentally about the 










Brahmo Samaj. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Do they only give lectures in the Brahmo Samaj? Or do they also 










meditate? I understand that they call their service in the temple 'upasana'. 



















"Keshab at one time thought a great deal of Christianity and the Christian views. At that 










time, and even before, he belonged to Devendranath Tagore's organization." 



















M: "Had Keshab Babu come here from the very beginning, he would not have been so 










preoccupied with social reform. He would not have been so busy with the abolition of the caste 










system, widow remarriage, intercaste marriage, women's education, and such social activities." 



















MASTER: "Keshab now believes in Kali as the Embodiment of Spirit and Consciousness, the 










Primal Energy. Besides, he repeats the holy name of the Mother and chants Her glories. 



















"Do you think the Brahmo Samaj will develop in the future into a sort of social-reform 










organization?" 



















M: "The soil of this country is different. Only what is true survives here." 



















MASTER: "Yes, that is so. The Sanatana Dharma, the Eternal Religion declared by the rishis, 










will alone endure. But there will also remain some sects like the Brahmo Samaj. Everything 










appears and disappears through the will of God." 



















Earlier in the afternoon several devotees from Calcutta had visited the Master and had sung 










many songs. One of the songs contained the following idea: "0 Mother, You have cajoled us with 










red toys. You will certainly come running to us when we throw them away and cry ourselves 










hoarse for You." 



















MASTER (to M.): "How well they sang about the red toys!" 



















M: "Yes, sir. You once told Kesbab about the red toys." 



















MASTER: "Yes. I also told him about the Chidakasa, the Inner Consciousness, and about 










many other things. Oh, how happy we were! We used to sing and dance together." 



















Saturday, January 5, 1884 





































It was the twenty-third day of M.'s stay with Sri Ramakrishna. M. had finished his midday 










meal about one o'clock and was resting in the nahabat when suddenly he heard someone call his 










name three or four times. Coming out, he saw Sri Ramakrishna calling to him from the verandah 










north of his room. 



















M. saluted the Master and they conversed on the south verandah. 



















MASTER: "I want to know how you meditate. When I meditated under the bel-tree I used to 










see various visions clearly. One day I saw in front of me money, a shawl, a tray of sandesh and two 










women. I asked my mind, 'Mind, do you want any of these?' I saw the sandesh to be mere filth. 










One of the women had a big ring in her nose. I could see both their inside and outside-entrails, 










filth, bone, flesh, and blood. The mind did not want any of these-money, shawl, sweets, or women. 










It remained fixed at the Lotus Feet of God. 



















"A small balance has two needles, the upper and the lower. The mind is the lower needle. I 










was always afraid lest the mind should move away from the upper needle-God. Further, I would 










see a man always sitting by me with a trident in his hand. He threatened to strike me with it if the 










lower needle moved away from the upper one. 



















"But no spiritual progress is possible without the renunciation of 'woman and 










gold'. renounced these three: land, wife, and wealth. Once I went to the Registry Office to register 










some land, the title of which was in the name of Raghuvir. The officer asked me to sign my name; 










but I didn't do it, because I couldn't feel that it was 'my' land. I was shown much respect as the 










guru of Keshab Sen. They presented me with mangoes, but I couldn't carry them home. A sannyasi 










cannot lay things up. 



















"How can one expect to attain God without renunciation? Suppose one thing is placed upon 










another; how can you get the second without removing the first? 



















"One must pray to God without any selfish desire. But selfish worship, if practised with 










perseverance, is gradually turned into selfless worship. Dhruva practised tapasya to obtain his 










kingdom, but at last he realized God. He said, 'Why should a man give up gold if he gets it while 










searching for glass beads?' 



















MASTER AND PHILANTHROPY 



















"God can be realized when a man acquires sattva. Householders engage in philanthropic 










work, such as charity, mostly with a motive. That is not good. But actions without motives are 










good. Yet it is very difficult to leave motives out of one's actions. 



















"When you realize God, will you pray to Him, '0 God, please grant that I may dig reservoirs, 










build roads, and found hospitals and dispensaries'? After the realization of God all such desires are 










left behind. 



















"Then mustn't one perform acts of compassion, such as charity to the poor? I do not forbid 










it. If a man has money, he should give it to remove the sorrows and sufferings that come to his 










notice. In such an event the wise man says, 'Give the poor something.' But inwardly he feels: 'What 










can I do? God alone is the Doer. I am nothing.' 





































"The great souls, deeply affected by the sufferings of men, show them the way to God. 










Sankaracharya kept the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach mankind. The gift of knowledge and 










devotion is far superior to the gift of food. Therefore Chaitanyadeva distributed bhakti to all, 










including the outcaste. Happiness and suffering are the inevitable characteristics of the body. You 










have come to eat mangoes. Fulfil that desire. The one thing needful is jnana and bhakti. God alone 










is Substance; all else is illusory. 



















"It is God alone who does everything. You may say that in that case man may commit sin. 










But that is not true. If a man is firmly convinced that God alone is the Doer and that he himself is 










nothing, then he will never make a false step. 



















MEANING OF FREE WILL 



















"It is God alone who has planted in man's mind what the 'Englishman' calls free will. People 










who have not realized God would become engaged in more and more sinful actions if God had not 










planted in them the notion of free will. Sin would have increased if God had not made the sinner 










feel that he alone was responsible for his sin. 



















"Those who have realized God are aware that free will is a mere appearance. In reality man 










is the machine and God its Operator, man is the carriage and God its Driver." 



















It was about four o'clock. Rakhal and several other devotees were listening to a kirtan by M. 










in the hut at the Panchavati. Rakhal went into a spiritual mood while listening to the devotional 










song. After a while the Master came to the Panchavati accompanied by Baburam and Harish. 










Other devotees followed.' 



















RAKHAL: "How well he [referring to M.] sang kirtan for us! He made us all very happy." 



















The Master sang in an ecstatic mood: 



















friends, how great is my relief to hear you chanting Krishna's name! . . . 



















To the devotees he said, "Always sing devotional songs" Continuing, he said: "To love God 










and live in the company of the devotees: that is all. What more is there?" He said, again: "When 










Krishna went to Mathura, Yasoda came to Radha, who was absorbed in meditation. Afterwards 










Radha said to Yasoda: 'I am the Primordial Energy. Ask a boon of Me.' 'What other boon shall I ask 










of You?' said Yasoda. Only bless me that I may serve God with my body, mind, and tongue; that I 










may behold His devotees with these eyes, that I may meditate on Him with this mind, and that I 










may chant His name and glories with this tongue.' 



















"But those who are firmly established in God may do as well without the devotees. This is 










true of those who feel the presence of God both within and without. Sometimes they don't enjoy 










the devotees' company. You don't whitewash a wall inlaid with mother of pearl-the lime won't 










stick." 



















The Master returned presently from the Panchavati, talking to M. 



















MASTER: "You have the voice of a woman. Can't you practise a song such as this? 





































Tell me, friend, how far is the grove Where Krishna, my Beloved, dwells? 



















(To M., pointing to Baburam) "You see, my own people have become strangers; Ramlal and 










my other relatives seem to be foreigners. And strangers have become my own. Don't you notice 










how I tell Baburam to go and wash his face? The devotees have become relatives. 



















(Looking at the Panchavati) "I used to sit there. In course of time I became mad. That phase 










also passed away. Kala, Siva, is Brahman. That which sports with Kala is Kali, the Primal Energy. Kali 










moves even the Immutable." 



















Saying this, the Master sang: 



















My mind is overwhelmed with wonder, Pondering the Mother's mystery; Her very name 










removes The fear of Kala, Death himself; Beneath Her feet lies Maha-Kala. . . . 



















Then he said to M.: "Today is Saturday. Go to the temple of Kali." 



















As the Master came to the bakul-tree he spoke to M. again: "Chidatma and ChitSakti. The 










Purusha is the Chidatma and Prakriti the ChitSakti. Sri Krishna is the Chidatma and Sri Radha the 










ChitSakti. The devotees are so many forms of the ChitSakti. They should think of themselves as 










companions or handmaids of the ChitSakti, Sri Radha. This is the whole gist of the thing.'" 



















After dusk Sri Ramakrishna went to the Kali temple and was pleased to see M. meditating 



















there. 



















The evening worship was over in the temples. The Master returned to his room and sat on 










the couch, absorbed in meditation on the Divine Mother. M. sat on the floor. There was no one 










else in the room. 



















The Master was in samadhi. He began to come gradually down to the normal plane. His 










mind was still filled with the consciousness of the Divine Mother. In that state he was speaking to 










Her like a small child making importunate demands on his mother. He said in a piteous voice: 










"Mother, why haven't You revealed to me that form of Yours, the form that bewitches the world? I 










pleaded with You so much for it. But You wouldn't listen to me. You act as You please." 



















The voice in which these words were uttered was very touching. 



















He went on: "Mother, one needs faith. Away with this wretched reasoning! Let it be 










blighted! One needs faith-faith in the words of the guru, childlike faith. The mother says to her 










child, 'A ghost lives there'; and the child is firmly convinced that the ghost is there. Again, the 










mother says to the child, 'A holy man is there', and the child is sure of it. Further, the mother says, 










pointing to a man, 'He is your elder brother', and the child believes that the man is one hundred 










and twenty-five per cent his brother. One needs faith. But why should I blame them, Mother? 










What can they do? It is necessary to go through reasoning once. Didn't You see how much I told 










him about it the other day? But it all proved useless." 





































MASTER'S PRAYER TO THE DIVINE MOTHER 



















The Master was weeping and praying to the Mother in a voice choked with emotion. He 










prayed to Her with tearful eyes for the welfare of the devotees: "Mother, may those who come to 










You have all their desires fulfilled! But please don't make them give up everything at once, Mother. 










Well, You may do whatever You like in the end. If You keep them in the world, Mother, then please 










reveal Yourself to them now and then. Otherwise, how will they live? How will they be encouraged 










if they don't see You once in a while? But You may do whatever You like in the end." 



















ADVICE TO M 



















The Master was still in the ecstatic mood. Suddenly he said to M: "Look here, you have had 










enough of reasoning. No more of it. Promise that you won't reason any more." 



















M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir. I won't." 



















MASTER: "You have had enough of it. When you came to me the first time, I told you your 










spiritual ideal. I know everything about you, do I not?" 



















M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "Yes, I know everything: what your Ideal is, who you are, your inside and outside, 










the events of your past lives, and your future. Do I not?" 



















M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "I scolded you on learning that you had a son. Now go home and live there. Let 










them know that you belong to them. But you must remember in your heart of hearts that you do 










not belong to them nor they to you." 



















M. sat in silence. The Master went on instructing him. 



















MASTER: "You have now learnt to fly. But keep your loving relationship with your father. 










Can't you prostrate yourself before him?" 



















M. (with folded hands): "Yes, sir. I can." 



















MASTER: "What more shall I say to you? You, know everything. You understand, don't you?" 










M. sat there without uttering a word. MASTER: "You have understood, haven't you?" 










M: "Yes, sir, I now understand a little." 



















MASTER: "No, you understand a great deal. RakhaTs father is pleased about his staying 



















here." 



















M. remained with folded hands. MASTER: "Yes, what you are thinking will also come to 










pass." Sri Ramakrishna now came down to the normal state of mind. Rakhal and Ramlal entered 










the room. At the Master's bidding Ramlal sang: 



















Who is the Woman yonder who lights the field of battle? Darker Her body gleams even than 










the darkest storm-cloud And from Her teeth there Bash the lightning's blinding flames... 





































He sang again: Who is this terrible Woman, dark as the sky at midnight? Who is this Woman 










dancing over the field of battle?... 



















MASTER: "The Divine Mother and the earthly mother. It is the Divine Mother who exists in 










the form of the universe and pervades everything as Consciousness. The earthly mother gives birth 










to this body. I used to go into samadhi uttering the word 'Ma'. While repeating the word I would 










draw the Mother of the Universe to me, as it were, like the fishermen casting their net and after a 










while drawing it in. When they draw in the net they find big fish inside it. 



















"Gauri once said that one attains true Knowledge when one realizes the identity of Kali and 










Gauranga. That which is Brahman is also Sakti, Kali. It is That, again, which, assuming the human 










form, has become Gauranga." 



















At the Master's request, Ramlal sang again, this time about Gauranga. 



















MASTER (to M.): "The Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of the Reality. God, plays in the 










world as man for the sake of His devotees. They can love God only if they see Him in a human 










form; only then can they show their affection for Him as their Brother, Sister, Father, Mother, or 










Child. 



















"It is just for this love of the devotees that God contracts Himself into a human form and 










descends on earth to play His lila." 



















THE MASTER AND HIS INJURED ARM 



















Saturday, February 2, 1884 



















IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna had been conversing with Rakhal , 










Mahimacharan, Hazra, and other devotees, when M. entered the room and saluted him. He 










brought with him splint, pad, and lint to bandage the Master's injured arm. 



















Master's injured arm 



















One day, while going toward the pine-grove, Sri Ramakrishna had fallen near the railing and 










dislocated a bone in his left arm. He had been in an ecstatic mood at the time and no one had 










been with him. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Hello! What was ailing you? Are you quite well now?" 










M: "Yes, sir, I am all right now." 



















MASTER (to Mahima): "Well, if I am the machine and God is its operator, then why should 










this have happened to me?" 



















The Master was sitting on the couch, listening to the story of Mahimacharan's pilgrimage. 










Mahima had visited several holy places twelve years before. 



















MAHIMA: "I found a brahmachari in a garden at Sicrole in Benares. He said he had been 










living there for twenty years but did not know its owner. He asked me if I worked in an office. On 










my answering in the negative, he said, 'Then are you a wandering holy man?' I saw a sadhu on the 





































bank of the Narmada. He repeated the Gayatri mentally. It so thrilled him that the hair on his body 










stood on end. And when he repeated the Gayatri and Om aloud, it thrilled those who sat near him 










and caused their hair to stand on end." 



















The Master was in the mood of a child. Being hungry he said to M., "What have you 










brought for me?" Looking at Rakhal he went into samadhi. 



















He was gradually coming down to the normal plane. To bring his mind back to the 










consciousness of the body, he said: "I shall eat some jilipi. I shall drink some water." 



















Weeping like a child, he said to the Divine Mother: "0 Brahmamayi! Mother! Why hast 










Thou done this to me? My arm is badly hurt. (To the devotees) Will I be all right again?" They 










consoled him, as one would a child, and said: "Surely. You will be quite well again." 



















MASTER (to Rakhal): "You aren't to blame for it, though you are living here to look after me; 










for even if you had accompanied me, you certainly wouldn't have gone up to the railing." 



















The Master again went into a spiritual mood and said: "Om! Om! Om! Mother, what is this 










that I am saying? Don't make me unconscious, Mother, with the Knowledge of Brahman. Don't 










give me Brahmajnana. I am but Thy child. I am easily worried and frightened. I want a Mother. A 










million salutations to the Knowledge of Brahman! Give it to those who seek it. Anandamayi! 










Blissful Mother!" 



















Uttering loudly the word "Anandamayi", he burst into tears and said: 



















Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart. That even with Thee for Mother, and 










though I am wide awake, There should be robbery in my house. 



















Again he said to the Divine Mother: "What wrong have I done, Mother? Do I ever do 










anything? It is Thou, Mother, who doest everything. I am the machine and Thou art its Operator. 



















(To Rakhal, smiling) "See that you don't fall! Don't be piqued and cheat yourself." 



















Again addressing the Mother, Sri Ramakrishna said: "Do I weep because I am hurt? Not at 



















all: 



















Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart, that even with Thee for Mother, and 










though I am wide awake, there should be robbery in my house." 



















The Master was again talking and laughing, like a child who, though ailing, sometimes 










forgets his illness and laughs and plays about. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "It will avail you nothing unless you realize Satchidananda. There 










is nothing like discrimination and renunciation. The worldly man's devotion to God is momentary 










like a drop of water on a redhot frying-pan. Perchance he looks at a flower and exclaims, 'Ah, what 










a wonderful creation of God!' 





































YEARNING FOR GOD 



















"One must be restless for God. If a son clamours persistently for his share of the property, 










his parents consult with each other and give it to him even though he is a minor. God will certainly 










listen to your prayers if you feel restless for Him. Since He has begotten us, surely we can claim our 










inheritance from Him. He is our own Father, our own Mother. We can force our demand on Him. 










We can say to him, 'Reveal Thyself to me or I shall cut my throat with a knife!' " 



















Sri Ramakrishna taught the devotees how to call on the Divine Mother. 



















MASTER'S PRAYER TO THE DIVINE MOTHER 



















MASTER: "I used to pray to Her in this way: '0 Mother! Blissful One! Reveal Thyself to me. 










Thou must!' Again, I would say to Her: '0 Lord of the lowly! Lord of the universe! Surely I am not 










outside Thy universe. I am bereft of knowledge. I am without discipline. I have no devotion. I know 










nothing. Thou must be gracious and reveal Thyself to me.' " 



















Thus the Master taught the devotees how to pray. They were deeply touched. Tears filled 










Mahimacharan's eyes. 



















Sri Ramakrishna looked at him and sang: 



















Cry to your Mother Syama with a real cry, mind ! And how can She hold Herself from you? 










How can Syama stay away? 



















Several devotees arrived from Shibpur. Since they had come from a great distance the 










Master could not disappoint them. He told them some of the essentials of spiritual life. 



















MASTER: "God alone is real, and all else illusory. The garden and its owner. God and His 










splendour. But people look at the garden only. How few seek out the owner!" 



















PRAYER AND DISCRIMINATION 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, what is the way?" 



















MASTER: "Discrimination between the Real and the unreal. One should always discriminate 










to the effect that God alone is real and the world unreal. And one should pray with sincere 










longing." 



















DEVOTEE: "But, sir, where is our leisure for these things?" 



















MASTER: "Those who have the time must meditate and worship. But those who cannot 










possibly do so must bow down whole-heartedly to God twice a day. He abides in the hearts of all; 










He knows that worldly people have many things to do. What else is possible for them? You don't 










have time to pray to God; therefore give Him the power of attorney. But all is in vain unless you 










attain God and see Him." 



















ANOTHER DEVOTEE: "Sir, to see you is the same as to see God." 



















MASTER: "Don't ever say that again. The waves belong to the Ganges, not the Ganges to the 










waves. A man cannot realize God unless he gets rid of all such egotistic ideas as 'I am such an 





































important man' or 'I am so and so'. Level the mound of T to the ground by dissolving it with tears 










of devotion." 



















DEVOTEE: "Why has God put us in the world?" 



















MASTER: "To perpetuate His creation. It is His will, His maya. He has deluded man with 










'woman and gold'." 



















DEVOTEE: "Why has He deluded us? Why has He so willed?" 



















MASTER: "If but once He should give man a taste of divine joy, then man would not care to 










lead a worldly life. The creation would come to an end. 



















"The grain-dealer stores rice in huge bags in his warehouse. Near them he puts some puffed 










rice in a tray. This is to keep the rats away. The puffed rice tastes sweet to the rats and they nibble 










at it all night; they do not seek the rice itself. But just think! One seer of rice yields fourteen seers 










of puffed rice. How infinitely superior is the joy of God to the pleasure of 'woman and gold'! To 










one who thinks of the beauty of God, the beauty of even Rambha and Tilottama appears as but the 










ashes of a funeral pyre." 



















DEVOTEE: "Why do we not feel intense restlessness to realize Him?" 



















MASTER: "A man does not feel restless for God until all his worldly desires are satisfied. He 










does not remember the Mother of the Universe until his share of the enjoyment of 'woman and 










gold' is completed. A child absorbed in play does not seek his mother. But after his play is over, he 










says, 'Mother! I must go to my mother.' Hriday's son was playing with the pigeons, calling to them, 










'Come! Ti, ti!' When he had had enough of play he began to cry. Then a stranger came and said: 










'Come with me. I will take you to your mother.' Unhesitatingly he climbed on the man's shoulders 










and was off. 



















"Those who are eternally free do not have to enter worldly life. Their desire for enjoyment 










has been satisfied with their very birth." 



















At five o'clock in the afternoon Dr. Madhusudan arrived. While he prepared the bandage for 










the Master's arm, Sri Ramakrishna laughed like a child and said, "You are the Madhusudan of both 










this world and the next!" 



















DR. MADHUSUDAN (smiling): "I only labour under the weight of my name." 



















THE POWER OF GOD'S NAME 



















MASTER (smiling): "Why, is the name a trifling thing? God is not different from His name. 










Satyabhama tried to balance Krishna with gold and precious stones, but could not do it. Then 










Rukmini put a tulsi-leaf with the name of Krishna on the scales. That balanced the Lord." 



















The doctor was ready to bandage the Master's arm. A bed was spread on the floor and the 










Master, laughing, lay down upon it. He said, intoning the words: "Ah! This is Radha's final stage. 










But Brinde says, 'Who knows what is yet to be?' " 





































The devotees were sitting around the Master. He sang: 



















The gopis all were gathered about the shore of the lake. 



















Sri Ramakrishna laughed and the devotees laughed with him. 



















After his arm was bandaged he said: "I haven't very much faith in your Calcutta physicians. 










When Sambhu became delirious, Dr. Sarvadhikari said: 'Oh, it is nothing. It is just grogginess from 










the medicine. And a little while after, Sambhu breathed his last." 



















It was evening and the worship in the temples was over. A few minutes later Adhar arrived 










from Calcutta to see the Master. Mahimacharan, Rakhal , and M. were in the room. 



















ADHAR: "How are you?" 



















MASTER (affectionately): "Look here. How my arm hurts! (Smiling) You don't have to ask 










how I am!" 



















Adhar sat on the floor with the devotees. The Master said to him, "Please stroke here 










gently." Adhar sat on the end of the couch and gently stroked Sri Ramakrishna's feet. 



















The Master conversed with Mahimacharan. 



















MASTER: "It will be very good if you can practise unselfish love for God. A man who has 










such love says: '0 Lord, I do not seek salvation, fame, wealth, or cure of disease. None of these do I 










seek. I want only Thee.' Many are the people who come to a rich man with various desires. But if 










someone comes to him simply out of love, not wanting any favour, then the rich man feels 










attracted to him. Prahlada had this unselfish love, this pure love for God without any worldly end." 



















Mahimacharan sat silent. The Master turned to him. 



















EGO SEPARATES ONE FROM BRAHMAN 



















MASTER: "Now let me tell you something that will agree with your mood. According to the 










Vedanta one has to know the real nature of one's own Self. But such knowledge is impossible 










without the renunciation of ego. The ego is like a stick that seems to divide the water in two. It 










makes you feel that you are one and I am another. When the ego disappears in samadhi, then one 










knows Brahman to be one's own inner consciousness. 



















"One must renounce the T that makes one feel, 'I am Mahima Chakravarty', 'I am a learned 










man', and so on. But the 'ego of Knowledge' does not injure one. Sankaracharya retained the 'ego 










of Knowledge' in order to teach mankind. 



















WARNING ABOUT LUST 



















"One cannot obtain the Knowledge of Brahman unless one is extremely cautious about 










women. Therefore it is very difficult for those who live in the world to get such Knowledge. 










However clever you may be, you will stain your body if you live in a sooty room. The company of a 










young woman evokes lust even in a lustless man. 





































"But it is not so harmful for a householder who follows the path of knowledge to enjoy 










conjugal happiness with his own wife now and then. He may satisfy his sexual impulse like any 










other natural impulse. Yes, you may enjoy a sweetmeat once in a while. (Mahimacharan laughs.) It 










is not so harmful for a householder. 



















HARD DISCIPLINE FOR SANNYASI 



















"But it is extremely harmful for a sannyasi. He must not look even at the portrait of a 










woman. A monk enjoying a woman is like a man swallowing the spittle he has already spat out. A 










sannyasi must not sit near a woman and talk to her, even if she is intensely pious. No, he must not 










talk to a woman even though he may have controlled his passion. 



















"A sannyasi must renounce both 'woman' and 'gold'. As he must not look even at the 










portrait of a woman, so also he must not touch gold, that is to say, money. It is bad for him even to 










keep money near him, for it brings in its train calculation, worry, insolence, anger, and such evils. 










There is an instance in the sun: it shines brightly; suddenly a cloud appears and hides it. 



















"That is why I didn't agree to the Marwari's depositing money for me with Hriday. I said: 










'No, I won't allow even that. If I keep money near me, it will certainly raise clouds.' 



















"Why all these strict rules for a sannyasi? It is for the welfare of mankind as well as for his 










own good. A sannyasi may himself lead an unattached life and may have controlled his passion, 










but he must renounce 'woman and gold' to set an example to the world. 



















"A man will have the courage to practise renunciation if he sees one hundred percent 










renunciation in a sannyasi. Then only will he try to give up 'woman and gold'. If a sannyasi does not 










set this example, then who will? 



















"One may lead a householder's life after realizing God. It is like churning butter from milk 










and then keeping the butter in water. Janaka led the life of a householder after attaining 










Brahmajnana. 



















"Janaka fenced with two swords, the one of jnana and the other of karma. The sannyasi 










renounces action; therefore he fences with one sword only, that of knowledge. A householder, 










endowed with knowledge like Janaka's, can enjoy fruit both from the tree and from the ground. He 










can serve holy men, entertain guests, and do other things like that. I said to the Divine Mother, '0 










Mother, I don't want to be a dry sadhu.' 



















"After attaining Brahmajnana one does not have to discriminate even about food. The rishis 










of olden times, endowed with the Knowledge of Brahman and having experienced divine bliss, ate 










everything, even pork. 



















(To Mahima) "Generally speaking there are two kinds of yoga: karmayoga and manoyoga, 










that is to say, union with God through work and through the mind. 





































FOUR STAGES OF LIFE 



















"There are four stages of life: brahmacharya, garhasthya, Vanaprastha, and sannyas. During 










the first three stages a man has to perform his worldly duties. The sannyasi carries only his staff, 










water-pot, and begging-bowl. He too may perform certain nityakarma, but his mind is not attached 










to it; he is not conscious of doing such work. Some sannyasis perform nityakarma to set an 










example to the world. If a householder or a man belonging to the other stages of life performs 










action without attachment, then he is united with God through such action. 



















"In the case of a paramahamsa, like Sukadeva, all karmas-all puja, japa, tarpan, sandhya, 










and so forth-drop away. In this state a man communes with God through the mind alone. 










Sometimes he may be pleased to perform outward activities for the welfare of mankind. But his 










recollection and contemplation of God remain uninterrupted." 



















It was about eight o'clock in the evening. Sri Ramakrishna asked Mahimacharan to recite a 










few hymns from the scriptures. Mahima read the first verse of the Uttara Gita, describing the 










nature of the Supreme Brahman: 



















He, Brahman, is one, partless, stainless, and beyond the ether; without beginning or end, 










unknowable by mind or intelligence. 



















Finally he came to the seventh verse of the third chapter, which reads: 



















The twice-born worships the Deity in fire, The munis contemplate Him in the heart, Men of 










limited wisdom see Him in the image, And the yogis who have attained samesightedness Behold 










Him everywhere. 



















No sooner did the Master hear the words "the yogis who have attained samesightedness" 










than he stood up and went into samadhi, his arm supported by the splint and bandage. 










Speechless, the devotees looked at this yogi who had himself attained the state of 










samesightedness. 



















After a long time the Master regained consciousness of the outer world and took his seat. 










He asked Mahima to recite verses describing the love of God. The latter recited from the Narada 










Pancharatra: 



















What need is there of penance if God is worshipped with love? What is the use of penance 










if God is not worshipped with love? What need is there of penance if God is seen within and 










without? What is the use of penance if God is not seen within and without? Brahman! my 










child! Cease from practising further penances. Hasten to Sankara, the Ocean of Heavenly Wisdom; 



















Obtain from Him the love of God, the pure love praised by devotees, Which snaps in twain 










the shackles that bind you to the world. 



















MASTER: "Ah! Ah!" 



















On hearing these verses the Master was about to go again into an ecstatic mood, but he 










restrained himself with effort. 



















Mahima read from the Yati-Panchaka: 





































I am She, the Divine Mother, in whom the illusion of the universe of animate and inanimate 










things is seen, as in magic, and in whom the universe shines, being the play of Her mind. I am She, 










the Embodiment of Consciousness, who is the Self of the universe, the only Existence, Knowledge, 










and Bliss. 



















When the Master heard the line, "I am She, the Embodiment of Consciousness", he said 










with a smile, "Whatever is in the microcosm is also in the macrocosm." 



















Next Mahima read the Six Stanzas of Nirvana: 



















Om. I am neither mind, intelligence, ego, nor chitta, Neither ears nor tongue nor the senses 










of smell and sight; Nor am I ether, earth, fire, water, or air: I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I am 










Siva! I am Siva! 



















I am neither the prana, nor the five vital breaths, Neither the seven elements of the body 










nor its five sheaths, Nor hands nor feet nor tongue, nor the organs of sex and voiding: I am Pure 










Knowledge and Bliss: I am Siva! I am Siva! 



















Neither loathing nor liking have I, neither greed nor delusion; No sense have I of ego or 










pride, neither dharma nor moksha; Neither desire of the mind nor object for its desiring: I am Pure 










Knowledge and Bliss: I am Siva! I am Siva! 



















Neither right nor wrong doing am I, neither pleasure nor pain, Nor the mantra, the sacred 










place, the Vedas, the sacrifice; Neither the act of eating, the eater, nor the food: I am Pure 










Knowledge and Bliss: I am Siva! I am Siva! 



















Death or fear I have none, nor any distinction of caste; Neither father nor mother nor even 










a birth have I; Neither friend nor comrade, neither disciple nor guru: I am Pure Knowledge and 










Bliss: I am Siva! I am Siva! 



















I have no form or fancy; the All-pervading am I; Eyerywhere I exist, yet I am beyond the 










senses; Neither salvation am I, nor anything that may be known: I am Pure Knowledge and Bliss: I 










am Siva! I am Siva! 



















Each time Mahima repeated: "I am Siva! I am Siva!", the Master rejoined with a smile: "Not 










I! Not I! Thou art Knowledge Absolute." 



















Mahima read a few more verses and also a description of the six psychic centres of the 










body. He said that in Benares he had witnessed the death of a yogi in the state of yoga. 



















MAHIMA: "There are fine passages in the Rama Gita." 



















MASTER: "You are speaking of the Rama Gita. Then you must be a staunch Vedantist. How 










many books of that kind the sadhus used to read here!" 



















Mahima recited the description of Om: 



















It is like the unceasing flow of oil; like the long peal of a bell. 





































About the characteristics of samadhi he read: "The man established in samadhi sees the 










upper region filled with Atman, the nether region filled with Atman, the middle region filled with 










Atman. He sees all filled with Atman." 



















Adhar and Mahima saluted the Master and departed. 



















At noon the following day, after his midday meal, Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small 










couch, when Ram, Surendra, and a few other devotees arrived from Calcutta. They were worried 










about the Master's injured arm. The arm was bandaged. M. was present. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "The Mother has put me in such a state of mind that I cannot 










hide anything from anyone. Mine is the condition of a child. Rakhal doesn't understand it. He 










covers my injured arm, wrapping my body with a cloth lest others should see my injury and 










criticize me. He took Dr. Madhu aside and reported my illness. But I shouted and said: 'Hello! 










Where are you, Madhusudan? Come and see. My arm is broken!' 



















"I used to sleep in the same room with Mathur and his wife. They took care of me as if I 










were their own child. I was then passing through a state of divine madness. Mathur would ask me, 










'Father, do you hear our conversation?' 'Yes', I would reply. 



















"Once Mathur's wife became suspicious of his movements and said to him, 'If you go 










anywhere, he must accompany you.' One day Mathur went to a certain place and asked me to wait 










downstairs. He returned after half an hour and said to me: 'Come, father, let us go now. The 










carriage is waiting.' When Mathur's wife asked me about it, I reported the thing correctly. I said to 










her: 'We went to a certain house. He told me to stay downstairs and himself went upstairs. He 










came down after half an hour and we left the place.' Of course she understood the thing in her 










own way. 



















"A partner of Mathur's estate used to take fruits and vegetables stealthily from the temple 










garden. When the other partners asked me about it, I told them the exact truth." 



















Sunday, February 24, 1884 



















Sri Ramakrishna was resting in his room after his midday meal, and Mani Mallick was sitting 










on the floor beside him, when M. arrived. M. saluted the Master and sat down beside Mani. The 










Master's injured arm was bandaged. 



















MASTER (to M.): "How did you come?" 



















M: "I came as far as Alambazar in a carriage and from there I walked." 










MANUAL: "Oh, he is so hot!" 



















MASTER (with a smile): "This makes me think that all these are not mere fancies of my 










brain. Otherwise why should these 'Englishmen' take so much trouble to come here?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to them about his health and his injured arm. 





































MASTER'S CHILDLIKE IMPATIENCE 



















MASTER: "Now and then I become impatient about my arm. I show it to this or that man 










and ask him whether I shall get well again. That makes Rakhal angry. He doesn't understand my 










mood. Now and then I say to myself, 'Let him go away.' Again I say to the Mother: 'Mother, where 










will he go? Why should he burn himself in the frying-pan of the world?' 



















"This childlike impatience of mine is nothing new. I used to ask Mathur Babu to feel my 










pulse and tell me whether I was ill. 



















"Well, where then is my faith in God? Once I was going to Kamarpukur in a bullock-cart, 










when several persons came up to the cart with clubs in their hands. They looked like highwaymen. 










I began to chant the names of the gods. Sometimes I repeated the names of Rama and Durga, and 










some times 'Om Tat Sat', so that in case one failed another would work. 



















(To M.) "Can you tell me why I am so impatient?" 



















M: "Your mind, sir, is always absorbed in samadhi. You have kept a fraction of it on your 










body for the welfare of the devotees. Therefore you feel impatient now and then for your body's 










safety." 



















MASTER: "That is true. A little of the mind is attached to the body. It wants to enjoy the love 










of God and the company of the devotees." 



















Mani Mallick told the Master about an exhibition that was being held in Calcutta. He 










described a beautiful image of Yasoda with the Baby Krishna on her lap. Sri Ramakrishna's eyes 










filled with tears. On hearing about Yasoda, the embodiment of maternal love, his spiritual 










consciousness was kindled and he wept. 



















MANUAL: "If you were not unwell, you could visit the exhibition in the Maidan." 



















MASTER (to M. and the others): "I shan't be able to see everything even if I go. Perhaps my 










eyes will fall on some certain thing and I shall become unconscious. Then I shall not be able to see 










the rest. I was taken to the Zoological Garden. I went into samadhi at the sight of the lion, for the 










carrier of the Mother awakened in my mind the consciousness of the Mother Herself. In that state 










who could see the other animals? I had to return home after seeing only the lion. Hence Jadu 










Mallick's mother first suggested that I should go to the exhibition and then said I should not." 



















Mani Mallick, about sixty-five years old, had been a member of the Brahmo Samaj for many 










years, and Sri Ramakrishna gave him instruction that would agree with his mood. 



















MASTER: "Pundit Jaynarayan had very liberal views. I visited him once and liked his attitude. 










But his sons wore high boots. He told me he intended to go to Benares and live there, and at last 










he carried out his intention; for later on he did live in Benares and die there. When one grows old 










one should retire, like Jaynarayan, and devote oneself to the thought of God. What do you say?" 



















MANILAL: "True, sir. I don't relish the worries and troubles of the world." 



















MASTER: "Gauri used to worship his wife with offerings of flowers. All women are 










manifestations of the Divine Mother. (To Manilal) Please tell them that little story of yours." 





































MANUAL (smiling): "Once several men were crossing the Ganges in a boat. One of them, a 










pundit, was making a great display of his erudition, saying that he had studied various books-the 










Vedas, the Vedanta, and the six systems of philosophy. He asked a fellow passenger, 'Do you know 










the Vedanta?' 'No, revered sir.' 'The Samkhya and the Patanjala?' 'No, revered sir.' 'Have you read 










no philosophy whatsoever?' 'No, revered sir.' The pundit was talking in this vain way and the 










passenger sitting in silence, when a great storm arose and the boat was about to sink. The 










passenger said to the pundit, 'Sir, can you swim?' 'No', replied the pundit. The passenger said, 'I 










don't know the Samkhya or the Patanjala, but I can swim.' " 



















MASTER (smiling): "What will a man gain by knowing many scriptures? The one thing 










needful is to know how to cross the river of the world. God alone is real, and all else illusory. 



















"While Arjuna was aiming his arrow at the eye of the bird, Drona asked him: 'What do you 










see? Do you see these kings?' 'No, sir', replied Arjuna. 'Do you 'See me'?' 'No.' 'The tree?' 'No.' 'The 










bird on the tree?' 'No.' 'What do you see then?' 'Only the eye of the bird.' 



















"He who sees only the eye of the bird can hit the mark. He alone is clever who sees that 










God is real and all else is illusory. What need have I of other information? Hanuman once 










remarked: 'I don't know anything about the phase of the moon or the position of the stars. I only 










contemplate Rama.' 



















(To M.) "Please buy a few fans for our use here. 



















(To Manilal) "Look here, pay a visit to his [meaning M.'s] father. The sight of a devotee will 










inspire you. 



















GOD'S MANIFESTATION AS MAN 



















(To M.) "Since my arm was injured a deep change has come over me. I now delight only in 










the Naralila, the human manifestation of God. Nitya and Lila. The Nitya is the Indivisible 










Satchidananda, and the Lila, or Sport, takes various forms, such as the Lila as God, the Lila as the 










deities, the Lila as man, and the Lila as the universe. 



















"Vaishnavcharan. used to say that one has attained Perfect Knowledge if one believes in 










God sporting as man. I wouldn't adopt it then. But now I realize that he was right. Vaishnavcharan 










liked pictures of man expressing tenderness and love. 



















(To Manilal) "It is God Himself who is sporting in the form of man. It is He alone, who has 










become Mani Mallick. The Sikhs teach: 'Thou art Satchidananda.' 



















"Now and then man catches a glimpse of his real Self and becomes speechless with wonder. 










At such times he swims in an ocean of joy. It is like suddenly meeting a dear relative. (To M.) The 










other day as I was coming here in a carriage, I felt like that at the sight of Baburam. When Siva 










realizes His own Self, He dances about in joy exclaiming, 'What am I! What am I!' 



















"The same thing has been described in the Adhyatma Ramayana. Narada said, '0 Rama, all 










men are Thy forms, and it is Sita who has become all women.' On looking at the actors in the 





































Ramlila, I felt that Narayana Himself had taken these human forms. The genuine and the imitation 










appeared to be the same. 



















"Why do people worship virgins? All women are so many forms of the Divine Mother. But 










Her manifestation is greatest in pure-souled virgins. 



















(To M.) "Why do I become impatient when I am ill? Because the Mother has placed me in 










the state of a child. The child depends entirely on its mother. The child of the maidservant, when 










he quarrels with the child of the master, says, 'I shall tell my mother.' 



















"I was taken to Radhabazar to be photographed. It had been arranged that I should go to 










Rajendra Mitra's house that day. I heard that Keshab would be there. I planned to 



















tell them certain things, but I forgot it all when I went to Radhabazar. I said: '0 Mother, 










Thou wilt speak. What shall I say?' 



















"I have not the nature of a Jnani. He considers himself great. He says, 'What? How can I be 



















ill?' 



















"Koar Singh once said to me, 'You still worry about your body.' But it is my nature to believe 










that my Mother knows everything. It was She who would speak at Rajendra Mitra's house. Hers 










are the only effective words. One ray of light from the Goddess of Wisdom stuns a thousand 










scholars. 



















"The Mother has kept me in the state of a bhakta, a vijnani. That is why I joke with Rakhal 










and the others. Had I been in the condition of a Jnani I couldn't do that. 



















"In this state I realize that it is the Mother alone who has become everything. I see Her 










everywhere. In the Kali temple I found that the Mother Herself had become everything-even the 










wicked, even the brother of Bhagavat Pundit. 



















"Once I was about to scold Ramlal's mother, but I had to restrain myself. I saw her to be a 










form of the Divine Mother. I worship virgins because I see in them the Divine Mother. My wife 










strokes my feet, but I salute her afterwards. 



















"You salute me by touching my feet. But had Hriday been here, who would have dared to 










touch them? He wouldn't have allowed anyone to do it. I have to return your salutes because the 










Mother has placed me in a state in which I see God in everything. 



















"You see, one cannot exclude even a wicked person. A tulsi-leaf, however dry or small, can 










be used for worship in the temple." 



















Sunday, March 2, 1884 Trailokya's songs 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch in his room, listening to devotional music by 










Trailokya Sannyal of the Brahmo Samaj. He had not yet recovered from the effects of the injury to 










his arm, which was still supported by a splint. Many devotees, including, Narendra, Srendra, and 










M., were sitting on the floor. 





































Narendra's father, a lawyer of the High Court of Calcutta, had passed away suddenly. He 










had not been able to make provision for the family, which consequently faced grave financial 










difficulties. The members of the family sometimes had to go without food. Narendra was therefore 










passing his days in great anxiety. 



















Trailokya sang about the Divine Mother: 



















Mother, I hide myself in Thy loving bosom; I gaze at Thy face and cry out, "Mother! 










Mother!" I sink in the Sea of Bliss and am lost to sense In yoga-sleep; I gaze with unwinking eyes 



















Upon Thy face, powerless to turn away. Mother, I am terrified by this world; My spirit 










trembles and cries out in fear. Keep me, sweet Mother, in Thy loving bosom; Cover me with the 










spreading skirt of Thy love. The Master shed tears of love and cried out, "Ah me! Ah me!" 



















Trailokya sang again: 



















Lord, Destroyer of my shame! Who but Thyself can save The honour of Thy devotee? 










Thou art the Ruler of my soul, my very life's Support, 



















And I am Thy slave for evermore. . . . 



















He continued: 



















Seeking a shelter at Thy feet, I have forever set aside My pride of caste and race, Lord, 










And turned my back on fear and shame. A lonely pilgrim on life's way, Where shall I go for succour 










now? For Thy sake, Lord, I bear men's blame; They rail at me with bitter words And hate me for my 










love of Thee. Both friends and strangers use me ill. 



















Thou art the Guardian of my name; Thou mayest save or slay me, Lord! Upon the honour of 










Thy servant Rests, Lord, Thy name as well; Thou art the Ruler of my soul, The glow of love within 










my heart; Do with me as it pleases Thee! 



















Once more he sang: 



















Lord, Thou hast taken me from home and made me captive with Thy love; Shield me for 










ever at Thy feet, Thou Beloved One! Upon the Nectar of Thy love, feed me both day and night, 










And save Premdas, who is Thy slave. 



















The Master again shed tears of joy. He sang some lines from a song of Ramprasad: 



















Glory and shame, bitter and sweet, are Thine alone; This world is nothing but Thy play. Then 










why, Blissful One, dost Thou cause a rift in it? 



















Addressing Trailokya, the Master said: "Ah! How touching your songs are! They are genuine. 










Only he who has gone to the ocean can fetch its water." 



















Trailokya sang again: 



















Thou it is that dancest, Lord, and Thou that singest the song; Thou it is that clappest Thy 










hands in time with the music's beat; But man, who is an onlooker merely, foolishly thinks it is he. 





































Though but a puppet, man becomes a god if he moves with Thee; Thou art the Mover of the 










machine, the Driver of the car; But man is weighted down with woe, dreaming that he is free. 



















Thou art the Root of everything, Thou the Soul of our souls; Thou art the Master of our 










hearts; through Thine unbounded grace Thou turnest even the meanest sinner into the mightiest 










saint. 



















The singing came to an end. The Master engaged in conversation with the devotees. 



















PROCESS OF NEGATION AND AFFIRMATION & GOD HIMSELF HAS BECOME EVERYTHING 



















MASTER: "God alone is the Master, and again, He is the Servant. This attitude indicates 










Perfect Knowledge. At first one discriminates, 'Not this, not this', and feels that God alone is real 










and all else is illusory. Afterwards the same person finds that it is God Himself who has become all 










this-the universe, maya, and the living beings. First negation and then affirmation. This is the view 










held by the Puranas. A vilwa-fruit, for instance, includes flesh, seeds, and shell. You get the flesh by 










discarding the shell and seeds. But if you want to know the weight of the fruit, you cannot find it if 










you discard the shell and seeds. Just so, one should attain Sarchidananda by negating the universe 










and its living beings. But after the attainment of Satchidananda one finds that Satchidananda Itself 










has become the universe and the living beings. It is of one substance that the flesh and the shell 










and seeds are made, just like butter and buttermilk. 



















THE WORLD DOES NOT EXIST APART FROM GOD 



















"It may be asked, 'How has Satchidananda become so hard?' This earth does indeed feel 










very hard to the touch. The answer is that blood and semen are thin liquids, and yet out of them 










comes such a big creature as man. Everything is possible for God. First of all reach the indivisible 










Satchidananda, and then, coming down, look at the universe. You will then find that everything is 










Its manifestation. It is God alone who has become everything. The world by no means exists apart 










from Him. 



















"All elements finally merge in Akasa. Again, at the time of creation, Akasa evolves into 










mahat and mahat into Ahamkara. In this way the whole world-system is evolved. It is the process 










of involution and evolution. A devotee of God accepts everything. He accepts the universe and its 










created beings as well as the indivisible Satchidananda. 



















"But the yogi's path is different. He does not come back after reaching the Paramatman, the 










Supreme Soul. He becomes united with It. 



















"The 'partial knower' limits God to one object only. He thinks that God cannot exist in 










anything beyond that. 



















THREE CLASSES OF DEVOTEES 



















"There are three classes of devotees. The lowest one says, 'God is up there.' That is, he 










points to heaven. The mediocre devotee says that God dwells in the heart as the 'Inner Controller'. 










But the highest devotee says: 'God alone has become everything. All that we perceive is so many 





































forms of God.' Narendra used to make fun of me and say: 'Yes, God has become all! Then a pot is 










God, a cup is God!' (Laughter.) 



















VISION OF GOD DESTROYS DOUBTS 



















"All doubts disappear when one sees God. It is one thing to hear of God, but quite a 










different thing to see Him. A man cannot have one hundred per cent conviction through mere 










hearing. But if he beholds God face to face, then he is wholly convinced. 



















"Formal worship drops away after the vision of God. It was thus that my worship in the 










temple came to an end. I used to worship the Deity in the Kali temple. It was suddenly revealed to 










me that everything is Pure Spirit. The utensils of worship, the altar, the door-frame-all Pure Spirit. 










Men, animals, and other living beings-all Pure Spirit. Then like a madman I began to shower 










flowers in all directions. Whatever I saw I worshipped. 



















"One day, while worshipping Siva, I was about to offer a bel-leaf on the head of the image, 










when it was revealed to me that this Virat, this Universe, itself is Siva. After that my worship of 










Siva through the image came to an end. Another day I had been plucking flowers, when it was 










revealed to me that the flowering plants were so many bouquets." 



















TRAILOKYA: "Ah! How beautiful is God's creation!" 



















MASTER: "Oh no, it is not that. It was revealed to me in a flash. I didn't calculate about it. 










It was shown to me that each plant was a bouquet adorning the Universal Form of God. That was 










the end of my plucking flowers. I look on man in just the same way. When I see a man, I see that it 










is God Himself who walks on earth, as it were, rocking to and fro, like a pillow floating on the 










waves. The pillow moves with the waves. It bobs up and down. 



















"The body has, indeed, only a momentary existence. God alone is real. Now the body exists, 










and now it does not. Years ago, when I had been suffering terribly from indigestion, Hriday said to 










me, 'Do ask the Mother to cure you.' I felt ashamed to speak to Her about my illness. I said to Her: 



















'Mother, I saw a skeleton in the Asiatic Society Museum. It was pieced together with wires 










into a human form. Mother, please keep my body together a little, like that, so that I may sing 










Thy name and glories.' 



















"Why this desire to live? After Ravana's death Rama and Lakshmana entered his capital and 










saw Nikasha, his old mother, running away. Lakshmana was surprised at this and said to Rama, 'All 










her children are dead, but still life attracts her so much!' Rama called Nikasha to His side and said: 










'Don't be afraid. Why are you running away?' She replied: 'Rama, it was not fear that made me flee 










from You. I have been able to see all these wondrous actions of Yours simply because I am alive. I 










shall see many more things like these if I continue to live. Hence I desire to live.' 



















"Without desires the body cannot live. (Smiling) I had one or two desires. I prayed to the 










Mother, '0 Mother, give me the company of those who have renounced "woman and gold".' I said 










further: 'I should like to enjoy the society of Thy jnanis and bhaktas. So give me a little strength 










that I may walk hither and thither and visit those people.' But She did not give me the strength to 










walk." 





































TRAILOKYA (smiling): "Have all the desires been fulfilled?" 





































MASTER (smiling): "No, there are still a few left. (All laugh.) 



















"The body is really impermanent. When my arm was broken I said to the Mother, 'Mother, 










it hurts me very much.' At once She revealed to me a carriage and its driver. Here and there a few 










screws were loose. The carriage moved as the driver directed it. It had no power of its own. 



















"Why then do I take care of the body? It is to enjoy God, to sing His name and glories, and 










to go about visiting His jnanis and bhaktas." 



















MASTER'S SYMPATHY FOR NARENDRAS SUFFERING 



















Narendra was sitting on the floor in front of the Master. 



















MASTER (to Trailokya and the other devotees): "The joys and sorrows of the body are 










inevitable. Look at Narendra. His father is dead, and his people have been put to extreme 










suffering. He can't find any way out of it. God places one sometimes in happiness and sometimes 










in misery." 



















TRAILOKYA: "Revered sir, God will be gracious to Narendra." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "But when? It is true that no one starves at the temple of 










Annapurna in Benares; but some must wait for food till evening. 



















"Once Hriday asked Sambhu Mallick for some money. Sambhu held the views of 










'Englishmen' on such matters. He said to Hriday: 'Why should I give you money? You can earn your 










livelihood by working. Even now you are earning something. The case of a very poor person is 










different. The purpose of charity is fulfilled if one gives money to the blind or the lame.' Thereupon 










Hriday said: 'Sir, please don't say that. I don't need your money. May God help me not to become 










blind or deaf or extremely poor! I don't want you to give, and I don't want to receive.' " 



















The Master spoke as if piqued because God had not yet shown His kindness to Narendra. 










Now and then he cast an affectionate glance at his beloved disciple. 



















NARENDRA: "lam now studying the views of the atheists." 



















MASTER: "There are two doctrines: the existence and the non-existence of God. Why don't 










you accept the first?" 



















SURENDRA: "God is just. He must look after His devotees." 



















MASTER: "It is said in the scriptures that only those who have been charitable in their 










former births get money in this life. But to tell you the truth, this world is God's maya. And there 










are many confusing things in this realm of maya. One cannot comprehend them. 



















GOD S WAYS ARE INSCRUTABLE 



















"The ways of God are inscrutable indeed. Bhishma lay on his bed of arrows. The Pandava 










brothers visited him in Krishna's company. Presently Bhishma burst into tears. The Pandavas said 





































to Krishna: 'Krishna, how amazing this is! Our grandsire Bhishma is one of the eight Vasus. 










Another man as wise as he is not to be found. Yet even he is bewildered by maya and weeps at 










death.' 'But', said Krishna, 'Bhishma isn't weeping on that account. You may ask him about it.' 










When asked, Bhishma said: '0 Krishna, I am unable to understand anything of the ways of God; 










God Himself is the constant companion of the Pandavas, and still they have no end of trouble. That 










is why I weep. When I reflect on this, I realize that one cannot understand anything of God's ways.' 



















"God has revealed to me that only the Paramatman, whom the Vedas describe as the Pure 










Soul, is as immutable as Mount Sumeru, unattached, and beyond pain and pleasure. There is much 










confusion in this world of His maya. One can by no means say that 'this' will come after 'that' or 










'this' will produce 'that'." 



















SURENDRA (smiling): "If by giving away money in a previous birth one gets wealth in this 










life, then we should all give away money now." 



















MASTER: "Those who have money should give it to the poor and needy. (To Trailokya) 










Jaygopal Sen is well-to-do. He should be charitable. That he is not so is to his discredit. There are 










some who are miserly even though they have money. There is no knowing who will enjoy their 










money afterwards. 



















"Jaygopal came here the other day. He drove over here in a carriage. The lamps were 










broken, the horse seemed to have been returned from the charnel-house, and the coachman 










looked as if he had just been discharged from the Medical College Hospital. And he brought me 










two rotten pomegranates!" (All laugh.) 



















SURENDRA: "Jaygopal Babu belongs to the Brahmo Samaj. I understand that now there is 










not one worth-while man in Keshab's organization. Vijay Goswami, Shivanath, and other notables 










have organized the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Govinda Adhikari, it is said, would not keep good actors in his theatre 










lest they should claim a share of the profit. (All laugh.) 



















"The other day I saw a disciple of Keshab. A theatrical performance was being given in 










Keshab's house, and I saw the disciple dancing on the stage with a child in his arms. I understand 










that this man delivers 'lectures'. He had better lecture to himself." 



















Trailokya sang: 



















Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness waves of ecstatic love arise: Rapture divine! Play of 










God's Bliss! Oh, how enthralling! Wondrous waves of the sweetness of God, ever new and ever 










enchanting, Rise on the surface, ever assuming Forms ever fresh. Then once more in the Great 










Communion all are merged, as the barrier walls of time and space dissolve and vanish: Dance then, 










mind! Dance in delight, with hands upraised, chanting Lord Hari's holy name. 



















Sri Ramakrishna requested Trailokya to sing the song beginning, "0 Mother, make me mad 










with Thy love". 





































Trailokya sang: 





































Mother, make me mad with Thy love! What need have I of knowledge or reason? Make 










me drunk with Thy love's Wine: Thou who stealest Thy bhaktas' hearts, Drown me deep in the 










Sea of Thy love! Here in this world, this madhouse of Thine Some laugh, some weep, some dance 










for joy: Jesus, Buddha, Moses, Gauranga, All are drunk with the Wine of Thy love. Mother, when 










shall I be blessed By joining their blissful company? 



















RULES FOR HOUSEHOLDERS AND MONKS 



















Sunday, March 9, 1884 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar with many devotees. Among 










them were Mani Mallick, Mahendra Kaviraj, Balaram, M., Bhavanath, Rakhal, Latu, and Harish. 










The Master's injured arm was in a splint. In spite of the injury he was constantly absorbed in 










samadhi or instructing the devotees. 



















Mani Mallick and Bhavanath referred to the exhibition which was then being held near the 










Asiatic Museum. They said: "Many maharajas have sent precious articles to the exhibition-gold 










couches and the like. It is worth seeing." 



















MASTER (to the devotees, with a smile): "Yes, you gain much by visiting those things. You 










realize that those articles of gold and the other things sent by maharajas are mere trash. That is a 










great gain in itself. When I used to go to Calcutta with Hriday, he would show me the Viceroy's 










palace and say: 'Look, uncle! There is the Viceroy's palace with the big columns.' The Mother 










revealed to me that they were merely clay bricks laid one on top of another. 



















GOD AND HIS SPLENDOUR 



















"God and His splendour. God alone is real; the splendour has but a two days existence. The 










magician and his magic. All become speechless with wonder at the magic, but it is all unreal. The 










magician alone is real. The rich man and his garden. People see only the garden; they should look 










for its rich owner." 



















MANI MALLICK (to the Master): "What a big electric light they have at the exhibition! It 










makes us think how great He must be who has made such an electric light." 



















GOD HIMSELF HAS BECOME EVERYTHING 



















MASTER (to Mani): "But according to one view it is He Himself who has become everything. 










Even those who say that are He. It is Satchidananda Itself that has become all-the Creator, maya, 










the universe, and living beings." 



















The conversation turned to the museum. 



















INFLUENCE OF COMPANY 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "I visited the museum once. I was shown fossils. A whole animal 










has become stone! Just see what an effect has been produced by company! Likewise, by 










constantly living in the company of a holy man one verily becomes holy." 





































MANI (smiling): "Had you visited the exhibition only once, we could receive instruction for 










ten or fifteen years." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "How so? You mean illustrations?" 



















BALARAM: "No, you shouldn't go. Your arm won't heal if you go here and there." 



















MASTER: "I should like to have two pictures. One of a yogi seated before a lighted log, and 










another of a yogi smoking hemp and the charcoal blazing up as he pulls. Such pictures kindle my 










spiritual consciousness, as an imitation fruit awakens the idea of a real one. 



















OBSTACLES TO YOGA 



















"The obstacle to yoga is 'woman and gold'. Yoga is possible when the mind becomes pure. 










The seat of the mind is between the eyebrows; but its look is fixed on the navel and the organs of 










generation and evacuation, that is to say, on 'woman and gold'. But through spiritual discipline the 










same mind looks upward. 



















SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE 



















"What are the spiritual disciplines that give the mind its upward direction? One learns all 










this by constantly living in holy company. The rishis of olden times lived either in solitude or in the 










company of holy persons; therefore they could easily renounce 'woman and gold' and 'fix their 










minds on God. They had no fear nor did they mind the criticism of others. 



















WILL-POWER NEEDED FOR RENUNCIATION 



















"In order to be able to renounce, one must pray to God for the will power to do so. One 










must immediately renounce what one feels to be unreal. The rishis had this will-power. Through it 










they controlled the sense-organs. If the tortoise once tucks in its limbs, you cannot make it bring 










them out even by cutting it into four pieces. 



















MASTER DENOUNCES HYPOCRISY 



















"The worldly man is a hypocrite. He cannot be guileless. He professes to love God, but he is 










attracted by worldly objects. He doesn't give God even a very small part of the love he feels for 










'woman and gold'. But he says that he loves God. (To Mani Mallick) Give up hypocrisy." 



















MANI: "Regarding whom, God or man?" 



















MASTER: "Regarding everything-man as well as God. One must not be a hypocrite. 



















"How guileless Bhavanath is! After his marriage he came to me and asked, 'Why do I feel so 










much love for my wife?' Alas, he is so guileless! 



















"Isn't it natural for a man to love his wife? This is due to the world bewitching maya of the 










Divine Mother of the Universe. A man feels about his wife that he has no one else in the world so 










near and dear; that she is his very own in life and death, here and hereafter. 





































"Again, how much a man suffers for his wife! Still he believes that there is no other relative 










so near. Look at the sad plight of a husband. Perhaps he earns twenty rupees a month and is the 










father of three children. He hasn't the means to feed them well. His roof leaks, but he hasn't the 










wherewithal to repair it. He cannot afford to buy new books for his son. He cannot invest his son 










with the sacred thread. He begs a few pennies from his different friends. 



















THE IDEAL OF A SPIRITUAL FAMILY 



















"But a wife endowed with spiritual wisdom is a real partner in life. She greatly helps her 










husband to follow the religious path. After the birth of one or two children they live like brother 










and sister. Both of them are devotees of God-His servant and His handmaid. Their family is a 










spiritual family. They are always happy with God and His devotees. They know that God alone is 










their own, from everlasting to everlasting. They are like the Pandava brothers; they do not forget 










God in happiness or in sorrow. 



















"The longing of the worldly-minded for God is momentary, like a drop of water on a red-hot 










frying-pan. The water hisses and dries up in an instant. The attention of the worldly-minded is 










directed to the enjoyment of worldly pleasure. Therefore they do not feel yearning and 










restlessness for God. 



















DIFFERENT FORMS OF AUSTERITY 



















"People may observe the ekadasi in three ways. First, the 'waterless' ekadasi-they are not 










permitted to drink even a drop of water. Likewise, an all-renouncing religious mendicant 










completely gives up all forms of enjoyment. Second, while observing the ekadasi they take milk 










and sandesh. Likewise, a householder devotee keeps in his house simple objects of enjoyment. 










Third, while observing the ekadasi they eat luchi and chakka. They eat their fill. They keep a couple 










of loaves soaking in milk, which they will eat later on 



















"A man practises spiritual discipline, but his mind is on 'woman and gold'-it is turned toward 










enjoyment. Therefore, in his case, the spiritual discipline does not produce the right result. 



















"Hazra used to practise much japa and austerity here. But in the country he has his wife, 










children, and land. Therefore along with his Spiritual discipline he carried on the business of a 










broker. Such people cannot be true to their word. One moment they say they will give up fish, but 










the next moment they break their vow. 



















"Is there anything that a man will not do for money? He will even compel a brahmin or a 










holy man to carry a load. 



















"In my room sweets would turn bad; still I could not give them away to the worldly-minded. 










I could accept dirty water from others, but not even touch the jar of a worldly person. 



















"At the sight of rich people Hazra would call them to him. He would give them long lectures. 










He would say to them: 'You see Rakhal and the other youngsters. They do not practise any spiritual 










discipline. They simply wander about merrily.' 





































"A man may live in a mountain cave, smear his body with ashes, observe fasts; and practise 










austere discipline; but if his mind dwells on worldly objects, on 'woman and gold', I say, 'Shame on 










him!' But I say that a man is blessed indeed who eats, drinks, and roams about, but who keeps his 










mind free from 'woman and gold'. 



















(Pointing to Mani Mallick) "There is no picture of a holy man at his house. Divine feeling is 










awakened through such pictures." 



















MANUAL: "Yes, there is. In one room there is a picture of a pious Christian woman engaged 










in prayer. There is another picture in which a man holds to the Hill of Faith; below is an ocean of 










immeasurable depth. If he gives up his hold on faith, he will drop into the bottomless water. 










There is still a third picture. Several virgins are keeping vigil, feeding their lamps with oil in 










expectation of the Bridegroom. A sleeping virgin is by their side. She will not behold the 










Bridegroom when He arrives. God is described here as the Bridegroom." 



















MASTER (smiling): "That's very nice." 



















MANUAL: "I have other pictures too-one of the 'Tree of Faith' and another of 'Sin and 










Virtue'." 



















MASTER (to Bhavanath): "Those are good pictures. Go to his house and see them." 










The Master remained silent a few minutes. 



















SIN AND REPENTANCE 



















MASTER: "Now and then I reflect on these ideas and find that I do not like them. In the 










beginning of spiritual life a man should think about sin and how to get rid of it. But when, through 










the grace of God, devotion and ecstatic love are awakened in his heart, then he altogether forgets 










virtue and sin. Then he leaves the scriptures and their injunctions far behind. Thoughts of 










repentance and penance do not bother him at all. 



















"It is like going to your destination along a winding river. This requires great effort and a 










long time. But when there is a flood all around, then you can go straight to your destination in a 










short time. Then you find the land lying under water deep as a bamboo pole. 



















"In the beginning of spiritual life one goes by a roundabout way. One has to suffer a great 










deal. But the path becomes very easy when ecstatic love is awakened in the heart. It is like going 










over the paddy-field after the harvest is over. You may then walk in any direction. Before the 










harvest you had to go along the winding balk, but now you can walk in any direction. There may be 










stubble in the field, but you will not be hurt by it if you walk with your shoes on. Just so, an 










aspirant does not suffer if he has discrimination, dispassion, and faith in the guru's words." 



















RULES FOR CONCENTRATION 



















MANILAL (to the Master): "Well, what is the rule for concentration? Where should one 










concentrate?" MASTER: "The heart is a splendid place. One can meditate there or in the Sahasrara. 










These are rules for meditation given in the scriptures. But you may meditate wherever you like. 





































Every place is filled with Brahman-Consciousness. Is there any place where It does not exist? 










Narayana, in Vali's presence, covered with two steps the heavens, the earth, and the interspaces. 










Is there then any place left uncovered by God? A dirty place is as holy as the bank of the Ganges. 










It is said that the whole creation is the Virat, the Universal Form of God. 



















TWO FORMS OF MEDITATION 



















"There are two kinds of meditation, one on the formless God and the other on God with 










form. But meditation on the formless God is extremely difficult. In that meditation you must 










wipe out all that you see or hear. You contemplate only the nature of your Inner Self. Meditating 










on His Inner Self, Shiva dances about. He exclaims, 'What am I! What am I!' This is called the Shiva 










yoga'. While practising this form of meditation, one directs one's look to the forehead. It is 










meditation on the nature of one's Inner Self after negating the world, following the Vedantic 










method of 'Neti, neti'. 



















"There is another form of meditation, known as the 'Vishnu yoga', The eyes are fixed on the 










tip of the nose. Half the look is directed inward and the other half outward. This is how one 










meditates on God with form. Sometimes Shiva meditates on God with form, and dances. At that 










time he exclaims, 'Rama! Rama!' and dances about." 



















MEANING OF OM 



















Sri Ramakrishna then explained the sacred Word "Om" and the true Knowledge of Brahman 










and the state of mind after the attainment of Brahmajnana. 



















MASTER: "The sound Om is Brahman. The rishis and sages practised austerity to realize that 










Sound-Brahman. After attaining perfection one hears the sound of this eternal Word rising 










spontaneously from the navel. 



















'"What will you gain', some sages ask, 'by merely hearing this sound?' You hear the roar of 










the ocean from a distance. By following the roar you can reach the ocean. As long as there is the 










roar, there must also be the ocean. By following the trail of Om you attain Brahman, of which the 










Word is the symbol. That Brahman has been described by the Vedas as the ultimate goal. But such 










vision is not possible as long as you are conscious of your ego. A man realizes Brahman only when 










he feels neither T nor 'you', neither 'one' nor 'many'. 



















"Think of the sun and of ten jars filled with water. The sun is reflected in each jar. At first 










you see one real sun and ten reflected ones. If you break nine of the jars, there will remain only 










the real sun and one reflection. Each jar represents a jiva. Following the reflection one can find the 










real sun. Through the individual soul one can reach the Supreme Soul. Through spiritual discipline 










the individual soul can get the vision of the Supreme Soul. What remains when the last jar is 










broken cannot be described. 



















IGNORANCE, KNOWLEDGE, AND SUPREME WISDOM 



















"The jiva at first remains in a state of ignorance. He is not conscious of God, but of the 










multiplicity. He sees many things around him. On attaining Knowledge he becomes conscious that 





































God dwells in all beings. Suppose a man has a thorn in the sole of his foot. He gets another thorn 










and takes out the first one. In other words, he removes the thorn of ajnana, ignorance, by means 










of the thorn of jnana, knowledge. But on attaining vijnana, he discards both thorns, knowledge and 










ignorance. Then he talks intimately with God day and night. It is no mere vision of God. 



















"He who has merely heard of milk is 'ignorant'. He who has seen milk has 'knowledge'. But 










he who has drunk milk and been strengthened by it has attained vijnana." 



















Thus the Master described his own state of mind to the devotees. He was indeed a vijnani. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "There is a difference between, a Sadhu endowed with jnana 










and one endowed with vijnana. The Jnani Sadhu has a certain way of sitting. He twirls his 










moustache and asks the visitor, 'Well, sir! Have you any question to ask?' But the man who always 










sees God and talks to Him intimately has an altogether different nature. He is sometimes like an 










inert thing, sometimes like a ghoul, sometimes like a child, and sometimes like a madman. 



















"When he is in samadhi, he becomes unconscious of the outer world and appears inert. He 










sees everything to be full of Brahman-Consciousness; therefore he behaves like a ghoul. He is not 










conscious of the holy and the unholy. He does not observe any formal purity. To him everything is 










Brahman. He is not aware of filth as such. Even rice and other cooked food after a few days 










become like filth. 



















"Again, he is like a madman. People notice his ways and actions and think of him as insane. 










Or sometimes he is like a child-no bondage, no shame, no hatred, no hesitation, or the like. 



















"One reaches this state of mind after having the vision of God. When a boat passes by a 










magnetic hill, its screws and nails become loose and drop out. Lust, anger, and the other passions 










cannot exist after the vision of God. 



















"Once a thunderbolt struck the Kali temple. I noticed that it flattened the points of the 










screws. 



















"It is no longer possible for the man who has seen God to beget children and perpetuate the 










creation. When a grain of paddy is sown it grows into a plant; but a grain of boiled paddy does 










not germinate. 



















"He who has seen God retains his T only in name. No evil can be done by that T. It is a mere 










appearance, like the mark left on the coconut tree by its branch. The branch has fallen off. Only 










the mark remains. 



















THE TWO EGOS 



















"I said to Keshab Sen, 'Give up the ego that makes you feel, "I am the doer; I am teaching 










people." 'Keshab said to me, 'Sir, then I cannot keep the organization.' Thereupon I said to him, 










'Give up the "wicked ego".' One doesn't have to renounce the ego that makes one feel, 'I am the 










servant of God; I am His devotee.' One doesn't develop the 'divine ego' as long as one retains the 










'wicked ego'. If a man is in charge of the store-room, the master of the house doesn't feel 










responsible for it. 





































GOD'S MANIFESTATION THROUGH MAN 



















(To the devotees) "You see, my nature is changing on account of this injury to my arm. It is 










being revealed to me that there is a greater manifestation of God in man than in other created 










beings. God is telling me, as it were: 'I dwell in men. Be merry with men.' Among men God 










manifests Himself in a still greater degree in pure-souled devotees. That is why I feel great longing 










for Narendra, Rakhal, and other such youngsters. 



















"One often sees small holes along the edge of a lake. Fish and crabs accumulate there. 










Just so, there is a greater accumulation of divinity in man. It is said that man is greater than the 










salagram. Man is Narayana Himself. If God can manifest Himself through an image, then why not 










through man also? 



















"God is born as man for the purpose of sporting as man. Rama, Krishna, and Chaitanya are 










examples. By meditating on an incarnation of God one meditates on God Himself." 



















Bhagavan Das, a Brahmo devotee, arrived. 



















THE ETERNAL RELIGION 



















MASTER (to Bhagavan Das): "The Eternal Religion, the religion of the rishis, has been in 










existence from time out of mind and will exist eternally. There exist in this Sanatana Dharma all 










forms of worship-worship of God with form and worship of the Impersonal Deity as well. It 










contains all paths-the path of knowledge, the path of devotion, and so on. Other forms of religion, 










the modern cults, will remain for a few days and then disappear." 



















March 23, 1884 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room after his midday meal, with Rakhal, Ram, and some 










other devotees. He was not quite well. The injured arm was still bandaged. 



















But in spite of his illness, his room was a veritable mart of joy and he the centre of it. 










Devotees thronged there daily to see the Master. Spiritual talk went on incessantly, and, the very 










air of the room vibrated with bliss. Sometimes the Master would sing the name and glories of God, 










and sometimes he would go into samadhi, the devotees being amazed at the ease with which the 










Master freed himself from the consciousness of the body. 



















RAM: "There is talk of Narendra's marrying Mr. R. Mitra's daughter. Narendra has been 










offered a large dowry." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Yes, Narendra may thus become a leader of society or something like 










that. He will be an outstanding man, whatever career he follows." 



















The Master did not much encourage the conversation about Narendra. 



















MASTER (to Ram): "Well, can you tell me why I become so impatient when I am ill? 










Sometimes I ask this man and sometimes that man how I may be cured. You see, one must either 










believe everyone or no one at all. 





































"It is God Himself who has become the physicians. Therefore one must believe all of them. 










But one cannot have faith in them if one thinks of them as mere men. 



















"Sambhu was fearfully delirious. Dr. Sarvadhikari said that the delirium was due to the 










strong medicine. Haladhari asked the doctor to feel his pulse. The doctor said: 'Let me see your 










eyes. Oh, it is an enlargement of the spleen!' Haladhari said he had nothing of the sort. But Dr. 










Madhu gives good medicine." 



















RAM: "The medicine by itself does no good, though it greatly helps nature." 



















MASTER: "If that is so, why does opium cause constipation?" 



















Ram referred to Keshab Sen's death. 



















RAM: "You were quite right. You said that a gardener uncovers the roots of a good 










rose-plant so that it may absorb the dew and grow stronger and healthier. The words of a holy 










man have been fulfilled." 



















MASTER: "I don't know about that. I wasn't calculating when I said it. It is you who say that." 



















RAM: "The Brahmos have published something about you in their magazine." 



















MASTER: "Published about me? Why? Why should they write now? I eat and drink and 










make merry. I don't know anything else. 



















MAN TEACHES BY GOD'S POWER 



















"I once asked Keshab, 'Why have you written about me?' He said that it would bring people 










here. But man cannot teach by his own power. One cannot conquer ignorance without the power 










of God. 



















"At one time two men were engaged to wrestle. One of them was Hanuman Singh and the 










other a Mussalman from the Punjab. The Mussalman was a strong, stout man. He had eaten lustily 










of butter and meat for fifteen days before the day of the wrestling-match, and even on that day. 










All thought he would be the victor. Hanuman Singh, on the other hand, clad in a dirty cloth, had 










eaten sparingly for some days before the day of the match and devoted himself to repeating the 










holy name of Mahavir. On the day of the match he observed a complete fast. All thought that he 










would surely be defeated. But it was he who won, while the man who had feasted for fifteen days 










lost the fight. 



















"What is the use of printing and advertising? He who teaches men gets his power from God. 










None but a man of renunciation can teach others. I am the greatest of all fools!" (All laugh.) 



















A DEVOTEE: "Then how is it that the Vedas and the Vedanta, and many things besides, 










come out of your mouth?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "During my boyhood I could understand what the Sadhus read at the 










Lahas' house at Kamarpukur, although I would miss a little here and there. If a pundit speaks to me 










in Sanskrit I can follow him, but I cannot speak it myself. 





































"To realize God is the one goal of life. While aiming his arrow at the mark, Arjuna said, 'I see 










only the eye of the bird and nothing else-not the kings, not the trees, not even the bird itself.' 



















"The realization of God is enough for me. What does it matter if I don't know Sanskrit? 



















"The grace of God falls alike on all His children, learned and illiterate— whoever longs for 










Him. The father has the same love for all his children. Suppose a father has five children. One 










calls him 'Baba', some 'Ba', and some 'Pa'. These last cannot pronounce the whole word. Does the 










father love those who address him as 'Baba' more than those who call him 'Pa'? The father knows 










that these last are simply too young to say 'Baba' correctly. 



















"Since this injury to my arm a change has been coming over my mind. I have been feeling 










much inclined to the Naralila. It is God Himself who plays about as human beings. If God can be 










worshipped through a clay image, then why not through a man? 



















"Once a merchant was shipwrecked. He floated to the shore of Ceylon, where Bibhishana 










was the king of the monsters. Bibhishana ordered his servants to bring the merchant to him. At the 










sight of him Bibhishana was overwhelmed with joy and said: 'Ah! He looks like my Rama. The same 










human form!' He adorned the merchant with robes and jewels, and worshipped him. When I first 










heard this story, I felt such joy that I cannot describe it. 



















"Vaishnavcharan said to me, 'If a person looks on his beloved as his Ishta, he finds it very 










easy to direct his mind to God.' The men and women of a particular sect at Syambazar, near 










Kamarpukur, say to each other, 'Whom do you love?' 'I love so-and so.' 'Then know him to be your 










God.' When I heard this, I said to them: 'That is not my way. I look on all women as my mother.' I 










found out that they talked big but led immoral lives. The women then asked me if they would have 










salvation. 'Yes,' I said, 'if you are absolutely faithful to one man and look on him as your God. But 










you cannot be liberated if you live with five men.' " 



















RAM: "I understand that Kedar Babu has recently visited the Kartabhajas' place." 



















MASTER: "He gathers honey from various flowers. (To Ram, Nityagopal, and the others) If a 










devotee believes one hundred per cent that his Chosen Ideal is God, then he attains God and sees 










Him. 



















"People of bygone generations had tremendous faith. What faith Haladhari's father had! 










Once he was on the way to his daughter's house when he noticed some beautiful flowers and 










vilwa-leaves. He gathered them for the worship of the Family Deity and walked back five or six 










miles to his own house. 



















"Once a theatrical troupe in the village was enacting the life of Rama. When Kaikeyi asked 










Rama to go into exile in the forest, Haladhari's father, who had been watching the performance, 










sprang up. He went to the actor who played Kaikeyi, crying out, 'You wretch!', and was about to 










burn the actor's face with a torch. He was a very pious man. After finishing his ablutions he would 










stand in the water and meditate on the Deity, reciting the invocation: 'I meditate on Thee, of red 










hue and four faces', while tears streamed down his cheeks. 





































"When my father walked along the lanes of the village wearing his wooden sandals, the 










shopkeepers would stand up out of respect and say, 'there he comes!' When he bathed in the 










Haldarpukur, the villagers would not have the courage to get into the water. Before bathing they 










would inquire if he had finished his bath. 



















"When my father chanted the name of Raghuvir, his chest would turn crimson. This also 










happened to me. When I saw the cows at Vrindavan returning from the pasture, I was transported 










into a divine mood and my body became red. 



















"Very strong was the faith of the people in those days. One hears that God used to dance 










then, taking the form of Kali, while the devotee clapped his hands keeping time." 



















A hathayogi was staying in the hut at the Panchavati. Ramprasanna, the son of 










Krishnakishore of Ariadaha, and several other men had become his devotees: The yogi needed 










twenty-five rupees a month for his milk and opium; so Ramprasanna had requested Sri 










Ramakrishna to speak to his devotees about the yogi and get some money. The Master said to 










several devotees: "A hathayogi has come to the Panchavati. Go and visit him. See what sort of man 










he is." 



















A young man of twenty-seven or twenty-eight, known as Thakur Dada, entered the room 










with a few friends and saluted the Master. He lived at Baranagore and was the son of a brahmin 










pundit. He was practising the kathakata in order to earn money to meet his family's expenses. At 










one time he had been seized with the spirit of renunciation and had gone away from his family. 










Even now he practised spiritual discipline at home. 



















MASTER: "Have you come on foot? Where do you live?" 



















DADA: "Yes, sir, I have walked from home. I live at Baranagore." 



















MASTER: "Have you come here for any particular purpose?" 



















DADA: "I have come here to visit you. I pray to God. But why do I suffer now and then from 










worries? For a few days I feel very happy. Why do I feel restless afterwards?" 



















MASTER: "I see. Things have not been fitted quite exactly. The machine works smoothly if 










the mechanic fits the cogs of the wheels correctly. In your case there is an obstruction 










somewhere." 



















DADA: "Yes, sir. That must be so." 



















MASTER: "Are you initiated?" 



















DADA: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "Do you have faith in your mantra?" 



















A friend of Thakur Dada said that the latter could sing well. The Master asked him to sing. 










Thakur Dada sang: 





































I shall become a yogi and dwell in Love's mountain cave; I shall be lost in yoga beside the 










Fountain-head of Bliss. I shall appease my hunger for Knowledge with the fruit of Truth; I shall 










worship the feet of God with the flower of Dispassion. 



















I shall not seek a well to slake the burning thirst of my heart, but I shall draw the water of 










Peace into the jar of my soul. Drinking the glorious Nectar of Thy blessed Lotus Feet, I shall both 










laugh and dance and weep and sing on the heights of Joy. 



















MASTER: "Ah, what a nice song! 'Fountain-head of Bliss'! 'Fruit of Truth'! 'Laugh and dance 










and weep and sing'! Your song tastes very sweet to me. Why should you worry? 



















"Pleasure and pain are inevitable in the life of the world. One suffers now and then from a 










little worry and trouble. A man living in a room full of soot cannot avoid being a little stained." 



















DADA: "Please tell me what I should do now." 



















MASTER: "Chant the name of Hari morning and evening, clapping your hands. Come once 










more when my arm is healed a bit." 



















Mahimacharan entered the room and saluted the Master. Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "Ah! 










He has sung a nice song. Please sing it again." Thakur Dada repeated the song. 



















MASTER (to Mahima): "Please recite that verse, the one about devotion to Hari" 



















Mahimacharan recited, quoting from the Narada Pancharatra: 



















What need is there of penance if God is worshipped with love? What is the use of penance 










if God is not worshipped with love? What need is there of penance if God is seen within and 










without? What is the use of penance if God is not seen within and without? 



















MASTER: "Recite that part also-'Obtain from Him the love of God'." 



















Mahima recited: 



















Brahman! my child! Cease from practising further penances. Hasten to Sankara, the 










Ocean of Heavenly Wisdom; Obtain from Him the love of God, the pure love praised by devotees, 










which snaps in twain the shackles that bind you to the world. 



















MASTER: "Yes, Sankara will bestow the love of God." 



















MAHIMA: "One who is free from bondage is the eternal Shiva." 



















MASTER: "Shame, hatred, fear, hesitation-these are the shackles. What do you say?" 



















MAHIMA: "Yes, sir. And also the desire to conceal, and shrinking before praise." 



















SIGNS OF KNOWLEDGE 



















MASTER: "There are two signs of knowledge. First, an unshakable buddhi. No matter how 










many sorrows, afflictions, dangers, and obstacles one may be faced with, one's mind does not 










undergo any change. It is like the blacksmith's anvil, which receives constant blows from the 





































hammer and still remains unshaken. And second, manliness-very strong grit. If lust and anger 










injure a man, he must renounce them once for all. If a tortoise once tucks in its limbs, it won't put 










them out again though you may cut it into four pieces. 



















TWO KINDS OF RENUNCIATION 



















(To Thakur Dada and the others) There are two kinds of renunciation: intense and feeble. 










Feeble renunciation is a slow process; one moves in a slow rhythm. Intense renunciation is like the 










sharp edge of a razor. It cuts the bondage of maya easily and at once. 



















"One farmer labours for days to bring water from the lake to his field. But his efforts are 










futile because he has no grit. Another farmer, after labouring for two or three days, takes a vow 










and says, 'I will bring water into my field today, and not till then will I go home.' He puts aside all 










thought of his bath or his meal. He labours the whole day and feels great joy when in the evening 










he finds water entering his field with a murmuring sound. Then he goes home and says to his wife: 










'Now give me some oil. I shall take my bath.' After finishing his bath and his meal he lies down to 










sleep with a peaceful mind. 



















"A certain woman said to her husband: 'So-and-so has developed a spirit of great dispassion 










for the world, but I don't see anything of the sort in you. He has sixteen wives. He is giving them up 










one by one.' The husband, with a towel in his shoulder, was going to the lake for his bath. He said 










to his wife: 'You are crazy! He won't be able to give up the world. Is it ever possible to renounce bit 










by bit? I can renounce. Look! Here I go.' He didn't stop even to settle his household affairs. He left 










home just as he was, the towel on his shoulder, and went away. That is intense renunciation. 



















"There is another kind of renunciation, called 'Markata Vairagya', 'monkey renunciation'. A 










man, harrowed by distress at home, puts on an ochre robe and goes away to Benares. For many 










days he does not send home any news of himself. Then he writes to his people: 'Don't be worried 










about me. I have got a job here.' 



















"There is always trouble in family life. The wife may be disobedient. Perhaps the husband 










earns only twenty rupees a month. He hasn't the means to perform the 'rice eating ceremony' for 










his baby. He cannot educate his son. The house is dilapidated. The roof leaks and he hasn't the 










money to repair it. 



















ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSEHOLDER'S LIFE 



















"Therefore when the youngsters come here I ask them whether they have anyone at home. 










(To Mahima) Why should householders renounce the world? What great troubles the wandering 










monks pass through! The wife of a certain man said to him: 'You want to renounce the world? 










Why? You will have to beg morsels from eight different homes. But here you get all your food at 










one place. Isn't that nice?' 



















"Wandering monks, while searching for a sadavrata, may have to go six miles out of their 










way. I have seen them travelling along the regular road after their pilgrimage to Puri and making a 










detour to find an eating-place. 





































"You are leading a householder's life. That is very good. It is like fighting from a fort. There 










are many disadvantages in fighting in an open field. So many dangers, too. Bullets may hit you. 



















"But one should spend some time in solitude and attain Knowledge. Then one can lead the 










life of a householder. Janaka lived in the world after attaining Knowledge. When you have gained 










it, you may live anywhere. Then nothing matters." 



















MAHIMA: "Sir, why does a man become deluded by worldly objects?" 



















MASTER: "It is because he lives in their midst without having realized God. Man never 










succumbs to delusion after he has realized God. The moth no longer enjoys darkness if it has once 










seen the light. 



















PRACTICE OF CONTINENCE 



















"To be able to realize God, one must practise absolute continence. Sages like Sukadeva are 










examples of an urdhvareta. Their chastity was absolutely unbroken. There is another class, who 










previously have had discharges of semen but who later on have controlled them. A man 










controlling the seminal fluid for twelve years develops a special power. He grows a new inner 










nerve called the nerve of memory. Through that nerve he remembers all, he understands all. 



















"Loss of semen impairs the strength. But it does not injure one if one loses it in a dream. 










That semen one gets from food. What remains after nocturnal discharge is enough. But one must 










not know a woman. 



















"The semen that remains after nocturnal discharge is very 'refined'. The Lahas kept jars of 










molasses in their house. Every jar had a hole in it. After a year they found that the molasses had 










crystallized like sugar candy. The unnecessary watery part had leaked out through the hole. 



















SANNYASI'S ABSOLUTE SELF-CONTROL 



















"A sannyasi must absolutely renounce woman. You are already involved; but that doesn't 










matter. "A sannyasi must not look even at the picture of a woman. But this is too difficult for an 










ordinary man. Sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni are the seven notes of the scale. It is not possible to keep 










your voice on 'ni' a long time. 



















"To lose semen is extremely harmful for a sannyasi. Therefore he must live so carefully that 










he will not have to see the form of a woman. He must keep himself away from a woman even if 










she is a devotee of God. It is injurious for him to look even at the picture of a woman. He will lose 










semen in a dream, if not in the waking state. 



















"A sannyasi may have control over his senses, but to set an example to mankind he should 










not talk with women. He must not talk to one very long, even if she is a devotee of God. . 



















"Living as a sannyasi is like observing the ekadasi without drinking even a drop of water. 










There are two other ways of observing the day. You may eat fruit or take luchi and curry. With the 










luchi and curry you may also take slices of bread soaked in milk. (All laugh.) 



















(Smiling) "Absolute fasting is not possible for you. 





































"Once I saw Krishnakishore eating luchi and curry on an ekadasi day. I said to Hriday, 'Hridu, 










I want to observe Krishnakishore's ekadasi!' (All laugh.) And so I did one day. I ate my fill. The next 










day I had to fast." (Laughter.) 



















The devotees who had gone to the Panchavati to visit the hathayogi came back. 



















MASTER (addressing them): "Well, what do you think of him? I dare say you have measured 










him with your own tape." 



















Sri Ramakrishna saw that very few of the devotees were willing to give money to the 










hathayogi. 



















MASTER: "You don't like a Sadhu if you have to give him money. Rajendra Mitra draws a 










salary of eight hundred rupees a month. He had been to Allahabad to see the kumbhamela. I asked 










him, 'Well, what kind of Sadhus did you see at the fair?' Rajendra said: 'I didn't find any very great 










Sadhu there. I noticed one, it is true. But even he accepted money.' 



















"I say to myself, 'If no one gives money to a Sadhu, then how will he feed himself?' There is 










no collection plate here; therefore all come. And I say to myself: 'Alas! They love their money. 










Let them have it.' " 



















The Master rested awhile. A devotee sat on the end of the small couch and gently stroked 










his feet. The Master said to him softly: "That which is formless again has form. One should believe 










in the forms of God also. By meditating on Kali the aspirant realizes God as Kali. Next he finds that 










the form merges in the Indivisible Absolute. That which is the Indivisible Satchidananda is verily 










Kali." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the semicircular porch west of his room, talking with 










Mahima and other devotees about the hathayogi. The talk drifted to Ramprasanna, the son of 










Krishnakishore. The Master was fond of the young man. 



















MASTER: "Ramprasanna roams about aimlessly. The other day he came here and sat in the 










room, but he did not speak a word. He pressed his nostrils with his fingers, practising pranayama. I 










offered him something to eat, but he wouldn't take it. On another occasion I had asked him to sit 










by me. He squatted on the floor placing one leg upon the other. He was rather discourteous to 










Captain. I weep at his mother's suffering. 



















(To Mahima) "Ramprasanna asked me to speak to you about the hathayogi. The yogi's daily 










expenses are six and a half annas. But he won't tell you about it himself." 



















MAHIMA: "Who will listen to him even if he does?" 



















Mani Sen of Panihati entered the room with several friends, one of whom was a physician. 










Mani asked the Master about his injured arm. The doctor did not approve of the medicine 










prescribed by Pratap Mazumdar. The Master said to him: "Why should you say that? Pratap is no 










fool. " 



















Suddenly Latu cried out, "Oh! The medicine bottle has dropped and broken." 





































It was not yet dusk. The Master, seated on the couch, was talking to M. Mahimacharan was 










on the semicircular porch engaged in a loud discussion of the scriptures with the physician friend 










of Mani Sen. Sri Ramakrishna heard it and with a smile said to M.: "There! He is delivering himself. 










That is the characteristic of rajas. It stimulates the desire to 'lecture' and to show off one's 










scholarship. But sattva makes one introspective. It makes one hide one's virtues. But I must say 










that Mahima is a grand person. He takes such delight in spiritual talk." 



















Adhar entered the room, saluted the Master, and sat by M.'s side. He had not come for the 










past few days. 



















MASTER: "Hello! Why haven't you come all these days?" 



















ADHAR: "Sir, I have been busy with so many things. I had to attend a conference of the 










school committee and various other meetings." 



















MASTER: "So you completely lost yourself in schools and meetings and forgot everything 



















else?" 



















ADHAR: "Everything else was hidden away in a corner of my mind. How is your arm?" 



















MASTER: "Just look. It is not yet healed. I have been taking medicine prescribed by Pratap." 



















After a time the Master suddenly said to Adhar: "Look here. All these are unreal-meetings, 










school, office, and everything else. God alone is the Substance, and all else is illusory. One should 










worship God with one's whole mind." 



















Adhar sat without speaking a word. 



















MASTER: "All else is illusory. This moment the body is and the next moment it is not. One 










must make haste to worship God. 



















"But you don't have to renounce everything. Live in the world the way the tortoise does. 










The tortoise roams about in the water but keeps its eggs on land. Its whole mind is on the eggs. 



















"What a nice state of mind Captain has developed! He looks like a rishi when he is seated to 










perform worship. He performs the Arati with lighted camphor and recites beautiful hymns. When 










he rises from his seat after finishing the worship, his eyes are swollen from emotion, as if bitten by 










ants. Besides, he always devotes himself to the study of the sacred books, such as the Gita and the 










Bhagavata. Once I used one or two English words before him, and that made him angry. He said, 










'English-educated people are profane.' " 



















After a while Adhar said humbly to the Master: "Sir, you haven't been to our place for a long 










time. The drawing-room smells worldly and everything else appears to be steeped in darkness." 



















The Master was deeply touched by these words of his devotee. He suddenly stood up and 










blessed M. and Adhar in an ecstatic mood, touching their heads and hearts. In a voice choked with 










love the Master said: "I look upon you as Narayana Himself. You are indeed my own." 



















Mahimacharan entered the room. 





































MASTER (to Mahima): "What I said about aspirants practising continence is true. Without 










chastity one cannot assimilate these teachings. 



















"Once a man said to Chaitanya: 'You give the devotees so much instruction. Why don't they 










make much progress?' Chaitanya said: 'They dissipate their powers in the company of women. 










That is why they cannot assimilate spiritual instruction. If one keeps water in a leaky jar, the water 










escapes little by little through the leak.' " 



















Mahima and the other devotees remained silent. After a time Mahima said, "Please pray to 










God for us that we may acquire the necessary strength." 



















MASTER: "Be on your guard even now. It is difficult, no doubt, to check the torrent in the 










rainy season. But a great deal of water has gone out. If you build the embankment now it will 










stand. 



















A DAY AT DAKSHINESWAR 



















Saturday, April 5, 1884 



















IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK in the morning when M. arrived at the temple garden and 










found Sri Ramakrishna seated on the small couch in his room. A few devotees were sitting on the 










floor. The Master was talking to them. Prankrishna Mukherji was there. 



















Prankrishna belonged to an aristocratic family and lived in the northern part of Calcutta. He 










held a high post in an English business firm. He was very much devoted to Sri Ramakrishna and, 










though a householder, derived great pleasure from the study of Vedanta philosophy. He was a 










frequent visitor at the temple garden. Once he invited the Master to his house in Calcutta and held 










a religious festival. Every day, early in the morning, he bathed in the holy water of the Ganges. 










Whenever it was convenient, he would come to Dakshineswar in a hired country boat. 



















That morning he had hired a boat and invited M. to accompany him to Dakshineswar. The 










boat had hardly left shore when the river became choppy. M. had become frightened and begged 










Prankrishna to put him back on land. In spite of assurances, M. had kept saying: "You must put me 










ashore. I shall walk to Dakshineswar." And so M. came on foot and found Sri Ramakrishna talking 










to Prankrishna and the others. 



















HOW THE LORD HIMSELF IS DELUDED BY HIS OWN MAYA 



















MASTER (to Prankrishna): "But there is a greater manifestation of God in man. You may ask, 










'How is it possible for God to be incarnated as a man who suffers from hunger, thirst, and the 










other traits of an embodied being, and perhaps also from disease and grief?' The reply is, 'Even 










Brahman weeps, entrapped in the snare of the five elements.' 



















"Don't you know how Rama had to weep, stricken with grief for Sita? Further, it is said that 










the Lord incarnated Himself as a sow in order to kill the demon Hiranyaksha. Hiranyaksha was 










eventually killed, but God would not go back to His abode in heaven. He enjoyed His sow's life. 










He had given birth to several young ones and was rather happy with them. The gods said among 










themselves: 'What does this mean? The Lord doesn't care to return to heaven!' They all went to 





































Shiva and laid the matter before him. Shiva came down and urged the Lord to leave the sow body 










and return to heaven. But the sow only suckled her young ones. (Laughter.) Then Shiva destroyed 










the sow body with his trident, and the Lord came out laughing aloud and went back to His own 










abode." 



















THE ANAHATA SOUND 



















PRANKRISHNA (to the Master): "Sir, what is the Anahata sound?" 



















MASTER: "It is a spontaneous sound constantly going on by itself. It is the sound of the 










Pranava, Om. It originates in the Supreme Brahman and is heard by yogis. People immersed in 










worldliness do not hear it. A yogi alone knows that this sound originates both from his navel and 










from the Supreme Brahman resting on the Ocean of Milk." 



















REINCARNATION 



















PRANKRISHNA: "Sir, what is the nature of the life after death?" 



















MASTER: "Keshab Sen also asked that question. As long as a man remains ignorant, that is 










to say, as long as he has not realized God, so long will, he be born. But after attaining Knowledge 










he will not have to come back to this earth or to any other plane of existence. 



















"The potter puts his pots in the sun to dry. Haven't you noticed that among them there are 










both baked and unbaked ones? When a cow happens to walk over them, some of the pots get 










broken to pieces. The broken pots that are already baked, the potter throws away, since they are 










of no more use to him. But the soft ones, though broken, he gathers up. He makes them into a 










lump and out of this forms new pots. In the same way, so long as a man has not realized God, he 










will have to come back to the Potter's hand, that is, he will have to be born again and again. 



















"What is the use of sowing a boiled paddy grain? It will never bring forth a shoot. Likewise, 










if a man is boiled in the fire of Knowledge, he will not be used for new creation. He is liberated. 



















THE "EGO OF DEVOTION" 



















"According to the Puranas, the bhakta and the Bhagavan are two separate entities. T am 










one and 'You' are another. The body is a plate, as it were, containing the water of mind, 










intelligence, and ego. Brahman is like the sun. It is reflected in the water. Therefore the devotee 










sees the divine form. 



















THE "EGO OF KNOWLEDGE" 



















"According to the Vedanta, Brahman alone is real and all else is maya, dreamlike and 










unsubstantial. The ego, like a stick, lies across the Ocean of Satchidananda. (To M.) Listen to what I 










am saying. When this ego is taken away, there remains only one undivided Ocean of 










Satchidananda. But as long as the stick of ego remains, there is an appearance of two: here is one 










part of the water and there another part. Attaining the Knowledge of Brahman one is established 










in samadhi. Then the ego is effaced. 





































"But Sankaracharya retained the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach men. 










THE SIGNS OF A JNANI 



















(To Prankrishna) But there are signs that distinguish the man of Knowledge. Some people 










think they have Knowledge. What are the characteristics of Knowledge? A Jnani cannot injure 










anybody. He becomes like a child. If a steel sword touches the philosopher's stone, it is 










transformed into gold. Gold can never cut. It may seem from the outside that a Jnani also has 










anger or egotism, but in reality he has no such thing. 



















THE EGO OF A JNANI 



















"From a distance a burnt string lying on the ground may look like a real one; but if you come 










near and blow at it, it disappears altogether. The anger and egotism of a Jnani are mere 










appearances; they are not real. 



















"A child has no attachment. He makes a play house, and if anyone touches it, he will jump 










about and cry. The next moment he himself will break it. This moment he may be very attached to 










his cloth. He says: 'My daddy has given it to me. I won't part with it.' But the next moment you can 










cajole him away from it with a toy. He will go away with you, leaving the cloth behind. 



















"These are the characteristics of a Jnani. Perhaps he has many luxuries at home— couch, 










chairs, paintings, and equipage. But any day he may leave all these and go off to Benares. 



















JNANI looks on the world as illusory 



















"According to Vedanta the waking state, too, is unreal. Once a wood-cutter lay dreaming, 










when someone woke him up. Greatly annoyed, he said: 'Why have you disturbed my sleep? I was 










dreaming that I was a king and the father of seven children. The princes were becoming well 










versed in letters and military arts. I was secure on my throne and ruled over my subjects. Why 










have you demolished my world of joy?' 'But that was a mere dream', said the other man. 'Why 










should that bother you?' 'Fool!' said the wood-cutter. 'You don't understand. My becoming a king 










in the dream was just as real as is my being a wood-cutter. If being a wood-cutter is real, then 










being a king in a dream is real also.' " 



















THE STATE OF A VIJNANI 



















Prankrishna always talked about jnana. Was this why the Master described the state of the 










Jnani? Now he proceeded to describe the state of the vijnani. 



















MASTER: "Jnana is the realization of Self through the process of 'Neti, neti', 'Not this, not 










this'. One goes into samadhi through this process of elimination and realizes the Atman. 



















"But vijnana means Knowledge with a greater fullness. Some have heard of milk, some have 










seen milk, and some have drunk milk. He who has merely heard of it is 'ignorant'. He who has seen 










it is a Jnani. But he who has drunk it has vijnana, that is to say, a fuller knowledge of it. After 










having the vision of God one talks to Him as if He were an intimate relative. That is vijnana. 





































"First of all you must discriminate, following the method of 'Neti, neti': 'He is not the five 










elements, nor the sense-organs, nor the mind, nor the intelligence, nor the ego. He is beyond all 










these cosmic principles.' You want to climb to the roof; then you must eliminate and leave behind 










all the steps one by one. The steps are by no means the roof. But after reaching the roof you find 










that the steps are made of the same materials— brick, lime, and brick-dust— as the roof. It is the 










Supreme Brahman that has become the universe and its living beings and the twenty-four cosmic 










principles. That which is Atman has become the five elements. You may ask why the earth is so 










hard, if it has come out of Atman? All is possible through the will of God. Don't you see that bone 










and flesh are made from blood and semen? How hard 'sea-foam' becomes! 



















"After attaining vijnana one can live in the world as well. Then one clearly realizes that God 










Himself has become the universe and all living beings, that He is not outside the world. 



















(To Prankrishna) "The fact is that one must have the 'spiritual eye'. You will develop that eye 










as soon as your mind becomes pure. Take for instance the Kumari Puja. I worshipped a virgin. 










The girl, to be sure, had all her human imperfections; still I regarded her as the Divine Mother 










Herself. 



















"On one side is the wife and on the other the son. Love is bestowed on both, but in 










different ways. Therefore it comes to this, that everything depends upon the mind. The pure mind 










acquires a new attitude. Through that mind one sees God in this world. Therefore one needs 










spiritual discipline. 



















"Yes, spiritual discipline is necessary. You should know that a man becomes easily attached 










to a woman. A woman naturally loves a man, and a man also naturally loves a woman. Therefore 










both fall speedily from their spiritual ideal. But it also must be said that there is a great advantage 










in leading the life of a householder. In case of urgent necessity a man may live with his wife. 



















(Smiling) "Well, M., why are you smiling?" 



















M. (to himself): "The Master makes this much allowance for house-holders since they 










cannot renounce everything. Is complete and absolute continence impossible for a householder?" 



















The hathayogi who had been living in the Panchavati entered the room. He was in the habit 










of taking milk and opium. He did not eat rice or other food and had no money to buy the milk and 










opium. The Master had talked with him in the Panchavati. The hathayogi had told Rakhal to ask 










the Master to make some provision for him, and Sri Ramakrishna had promised to speak about it 










to the visitors from Calcutta. 



















HATHAYOGI (to the Master): "What did you say to Rakhal about me?" 



















MASTER: "I said that I would ask some rich visitors to help you. But (to Prankrishna) you, 










perhaps, do not like these yogis?" 



















Prankrishna remained silent. The hathayogi left the room and the conversation went on. 





































MASTER'S ADHERENCE TO TRUTH 



















MASTER (to Prankrishna and the others): "If a man leads a householder's life he must have 










unflagging devotion to truth. God can be realized through truth alone. Formerly I was very 










particular about telling the truth, though now my zeal has abated a little. If I said, 'I shall bathe', 










then I would get into the water of the Ganges, recite the mantra, and sprinkle a little water over 










my head. But still there would remain some doubt in me as to whether my bath was complete. 










Once I went to Ram's house in Calcutta. I happened to say, 'I shall not take any luchi.' When I sat 










down for the meal I felt hungry. But I had said I would not eat the luchi; so I had to fill my stomach 










with sweets. (All laugh.) 



















"But my zeal for truthfulness has abated a little now. Once I said I would go to the 










pine-grove, but then I felt I had no particular urge to go. What was to be done? I asked Ram about 










it. He said I didn't have to go. Then I reasoned to myself: 'Well, everyone is Narayana. So Ram, too, 










is Narayana. Why shouldn't I listen to him? The elephant is Narayana no doubt; but the mahut is 










Narayana too. Since the mahut asked me not to go near the elephant, then why shouldn't I obey 










him?' Through reasoning like this my zeal for truthfulness is slightly less strong now than before. 



















"I find a change, coming over me. Years ago Vaishnavcharan said to me, 'One attains Perfect 










Knowledge when one sees God in man.' Now I see that it is God alone who is moving about in 










various forms: as a holy man, as a cheat, as a villain. Therefore I say, 'Narayana in the guise of the 










Sadhu, Narayana in the guise of the cheat, Narayana in the guise of the villain, Narayana in the 










guise of the lecher.' 



















"Now my problem is how I can feed all of you. I want to feed everyone. So I keep one at a 










time with me and feed him." 



















Prankrishna (looking at M. and smiling): "A fine man, indeed! (To the Master) He would not 










let us go till we put him ashore." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Why? What happened?" 



















PRANKRISHNA: "He was in our boat. Seeing that the river was slightly rough, he insisted on 










being put ashore. (To M.) 'How did you come?" 



















M. (smiling): "On foot." 



















Sri Ramakrishna laughed. 



















PRANKRISHNA (to the Master): "Sir, I am thinking now of giving up my work. One who is 










involved in activity cannot accomplish anything. (Pointing to his companion) I am training him to 










do my work. After I resign, he will relieve me. Work has become intolerable." 



















MASTER: "Yes, work is very troublesome. It is now good for you to meditate on God for a 










few days in solitude. No doubt you say that you would like to give up your work. Captain said the 










same thing. Worldly people talk that way; but they don't succeed in carrying out their intention. 



















"There are many pundits who speak words of wisdom. But they merely talk; they don't live 










up to them. They are like vultures, which soar very high but keep their gaze fixed on the 





































charnel-pit. What I mean is that these pundits are attached to the world, to 'woman and gold'. If I 










hear that pundits are practising discrimination and dispassion, then I fear them. Otherwise I look 










upon them as mere goats and dogs." 



















Prankrishna saluted the Master and took his leave. He said to M., "Will you come with us?" 



















M: "No, sir! Catch me going with you again! Good-bye." 



















Prankrishna laughed and said, "I see you won't come in the boat." 



















M. took a little stroll near the Panchavati and bathed in the river. Then he went to the 










temples of Radhakanta and Kali and prostrated himself before the images. He said to himself: "I 










have heard that God has no form. Then why do I bow before these images? Is it because Sri 










Ramakrishna believes in gods and goddesses with form? I don't know anything about God, nor do I 










understand Him. The Master believes in images; then why shouldn't I too, who am so insignificant 










a creature, accept them?" 



















M. looked at the image of Kali. He saw that the Divine Mother holds in Her two left hands a 










man's severed head and a sword. With Her two right hands She offers boons and reassurance to 










Her devotees. In one aspect She is terrible, and in another She is the ever affectionate Mother of 










Her devotees. The two ideals are harmonized in Her. She is compassionate and affectionate to Her 










devotees: to those who are submissive and helpless. It is also true that She is terrible, the "Consort 










of Death". She alone knows why She assumes two aspects at the same time. 



















M. remembered this interpretation of Kali given by the Master. He said to himself, "I have 










heard that Keshab accepted Kali in Sri Ramakrishna's presence. Is this, as Keshab used to say, the 










Goddess, all Spirit and Consciousness; manifesting Herself through a clay image?" 



















M. returned to the Master's room and sat on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna offered him some 










fruit and sweets to eat. On account of trouble in the family, M. had recently rented a house in 










another section of Calcutta near his school, his father and brothers continuing to live in the 










ancestral home. But Sri Ramakrishna wanted him to return to his own home, since a joint family 










affords many advantages to one leading a religious life. Once or twice the Master had spoken to 










M. to this effect, but unfortunately he had not yet returned to his family. Sri Ramakrishna referred 










to the matter again. 



















MASTER: "Tell me that you are going to your ancestral home." 



















M: "I can never persuade myself to enter that place." 



















MASTER: "Why? Your father is making over the whole house." 



















M: "I have suffered too much there. I can by no means make up my mind to go there." 










MASTER: "Whom do you fear?" 










M: "All of them." 



















MASTER (seriously): "Isn't that like your being afraid to get into the boat?" 





































The midday worship and the offering of food in the temples were over. The bells, gongs, 










and symbals of the Arati were being played, and the temple garden was filled with joyful activity. 










Beggars, Sadhus, and guests hurried to the guest-house for the noonday meal, carrying leaf or 










metal plates in their hands. M. also took some of the Prasad from the Kali temple. 



















Sri Ramakrishna had been resting awhile after his meal when several devotees, including 










Ram and Girindra, arrived. They sat down after saluting the Master. The conversation turned to 










the New Dispensation Church of Keshab Chandra Sen. 



















RAM (to the Master): "Sir, I don't think the Navavidhan has done people any good. If Keshab 










Babu himself was a genuine man, why are his disciples left in such a plight? I don't think there is 










anything at all in the New Dispensation. It is like rattling some potsherds in a room and then 










locking it up. People may take it to be the jingling of coins, but inside there is nothing but 










potsherds. Outsiders don't know what is inside." 



















MASTER: "There must be some substance in it. Otherwise, why should so many people 










respect Keshab? Why isn't Shivanath honoured as much as Keshab? Such a thing cannot happen 










without the will of God. 



















A TEACHER MUST RENOUNCE THE WORLD 



















"But a man cannot act as an Acharya without renouncing the world. People won't respect 










him. They will say: 'Oh, he is a worldly man. He secretly enjoys "woman and gold" himself but tells 










us that God alone is real and the world unsubstantial, like a dream. 'Unless a man renounces 










everything his teachings cannot be accepted by all. Some worldly people may follow him. Keshab 










led the life of a householder; hence his mind was directed to the world also. He had to safeguard 










his family interests. That is why he left his affairs in such good order though he delivered so many 










religious lectures. What an aristocratic man he married his daughter to! Inside Keshab's inner 










apartments I saw many big bedsteads. All these things gradually come to one who leads a 










householder's life. The world is indeed a place for enjoyment." 



















RAM: "Keshab Sen inherited those bedsteads when his ancestral property was divided. And 










for Keshab to take part in the division of property! Whatever you may say, sir, Vijay Babu told me 










that Keshab had said to him, 'I am a partial manifestation of Christ and Gauranga. I suggest that 










you declare yourself as Advaita.' Do you know what else he said? He said that you too were a 










follower of the New Dispensation." (All laugh.) 



















MASTER (laughing): "Who knows? But as for myself, I don't even know what the term 'New 










Dispensation' means." (Laughter.) 



















RAM: "Keshab's disciples say that he was the first to harmonize jnana and bhakti." 



















SYNTHESIS OF JNANA AND BHAKTI 



















MASTER (in surprise): "How is that? What then of the Adhyatma Ramayana? It is written 










there that, while praying to Rama, Narada said: '0 Rama, Thou art the Supreme Brahman 










described in the Vedas. Thou dwellest with us as a man; Thou appearest as a man. In reality Thou 





































art not a man; Thou art that Supreme Brahman.' Rama said: 'Narada, I am very much pleased with 










you. Accept a boon from Me.' Narada replied: 'What boon shall I ask of Thee? Grant me pure love 










for Thy Lotus Feet, and may I never be deluded by Thy world-bewitching maya!' The Adhyatma 










Ramayana is full of such statements regarding jnana and bhakti." 



















The conversation turned to Amrita, a disciple of Keshab. 



















RAM: "Amrita Babu seems to be in very bad shape." 



















MASTER: "Yes, he looked very ill when I saw him the other day." 



















RAM: "Sir, let me tell you about the lectures of the New Dispensation. While the drum is 










being played, the members cry out, 'Victory unto Keshab!' You say that 'dal' grows only in a 










stagnant pool. So Amrita said one day in the course of his sermon: 'The holy man has no doubt said 










that 'dal' grows in a stagnant pool. But, brothers, we want 'dal', we want a sect. Really and truly, I 










tell you that we want a sect.' " 



















MASTER: "What nonsense! Shame on him! What kind of sermon is that?" 



















The conversation drifted to the desire of some people for praise. 



















MASTER: "They took me to Keshab's house to see a performance of the Nimai-sannyas. I 










heard, that day, someone speaking of Keshab and Pratap as Chaitanya and Nityananda. Prasanna 










asked me, 'Who are you then?' Keshab looked at me to see what I would say. I said to him, 'I am 










the servant of your servant, the dust of the dust of your feet.' Keshab said with a smile, 'You can't 










catch him!'" 



















RAM: "Sometimes Keshab used to say you were John the Baptist." 



















A DEVOTEE: "But Keshab also said you were the Chaitanya of the nineteenth century [said in 










English]." 



















MASTER: "What does that mean?" 



















DEVOTEE: "That Chaitanya has been incarnated again in the present century of the Christian 










era, and that you are he." 



















MASTER (absent-mindedly): "What of it? Can you tell me now how my arm can be cured? 










This arm is worrying me so much." 



















They talked about Trailokya's music. Trailokya sang devotional songs in Keshab's Brahmo 



















Samaj. 



















MASTER: "Ah! How nice his songs are!" 










RAM: "Do you think they are genuine?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, they are. Otherwise, why should I be so drawn to them?" 





































RAM: "He has composed his songs by borrowing your ideas. While conducting the worship, 










Keshab Sen described your feelings and realizations, and Trailokya Babu composed songs 










accordingly. Take this song, for instance: 



















There is an overflow of Joy in the market-place of Love; See how the Lord sports with His 










own in the ecstasy of Bliss! 



















He saw you enjoying divine bliss in the company of devotees and wrote songs like this." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "Stop! Don't torment me any more. Why should I be involved in all 










this?" (All laugh.) 



















GIRINDRA: "The Brahmos say that the Paramahamsa Deva has no faculty for organization 










[said in English]." 



















MASTER: "What does that mean?" 



















M: "That you don't know how to lead a sect; that your intellect is rather dull. They say 










things like that." (All laugh.) 



















MASTER (to Ram): "Now tell me why my arm was hurt. Stand up and deliver a lecture on 










that. (Laughter.) 



















"The Brahmos insist that God is formless. Suppose they do. It is enough to call on Him with 










sincerity of heart. If the devotee is sincere, then God, who is the Inner Guide of all, will certainly 










reveal to the devotee His true nature. 



















FRICTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS SECTS 



















"But it is not good to say that what we ourselves think of God is the only truth and what 










others think is false; that because we think of God as formless, therefore He is formless and cannot 










have any form; that because we think of God as having form, therefore He has form and cannot be 










formless. Can a man really fathom God's nature? 



















"This kind of friction exists between the Vaishnavas and the Shaktas. The Vaishnava says, 










'My Kesava is the only Saviour', whereas the Shakta insists, 'My Bhagavati is the only Saviour.' 



















"Once I took Vaishnavcharan to Mathur Babu. Now, Vaishnavcharan was a very learned 










Vaishnava and an orthodox devotee of his sect. Mathur, on the other hand, was a devotee of the 










Divine Mother. They were engaged in a friendly discussion when suddenly Vaishnavcharan said, 










'Kesava is the only Saviour.' No sooner did Mathur hear this than his face became red with anger 










and he blurted out, 'You rascal!' (All laugh.) He was a Shakta. Wasn't it natural for him to say that? 










I gave Vaishnavcharan a nudge. 



















HARMONY OF RELIGIONS 



















"I see people who talk about religion constantly quarrelling with one another. Hindus, 










Mussalmans, Brahmos, Shaktas, Vaishnavas, Saivas, all quarrel with one another. They haven't the 










intelligence to understand that He who is called Krishna is also Shiva and the Primal Sakti, and that 





































it is He, again, who is called Jesus and Allah. There is only one Rama and He has a thousand 










names.' 



















"Truth is one; only It is called by different names. All people are seeking the same Truth; the 










variance is due to climate, temperament, and name. A lake has many ghats. From one Ghat the 










Hindus take water in jars and call it 'jal'. From another Ghat the Mussalmans take water in leather 










bags and call it 'pani'. From a third the Christians take the same thing and call it 'water'. (All laugh.) 










Suppose someone says that the thing is not 'jal' but 'pani', or that it is not 'pani' but 'water', or that 










it is not 'water' but 'jal'. It would indeed be ridiculous. But this very thing is at the root of the 










friction among sects, their misunderstandings and quarrels. This is why people injure and kill one 










another, and shed blood, in the name of religion. But this is not good. Everyone is going toward 










God. They will all realize Him if they have sincerity and longing of heart. 



















(To M.) "This is for you. All scriptures-the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras-seek Him alone 










and no one else, only that one Satchidananda. That which is called Satchidananda Brahman in the 










Vedas is called Satchidananda Shiva in the Tantra. Again it is He alone who is called Satchidananda 










Krishna in the Puranas." 



















The Master was told that now and then Ram cooked his own food at home. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Do you too cook your own meals?" 



















M: "No, sir." 



















MASTER: "You may try it. With your meals take a little clarified butter made from cow's 










milk. That will purify your body and mind." 



















A long conversation ensued about Ram's household affairs. Ram's father was a devout 










Vaishnava and worshipped Krishna daily at home. He had married a second time when Ram was 










quite young. Both the father and the stepmother lived with Ram at Ram's house. But Ram was 










never happy with his stepmother, and this sometimes created a misunderstanding between 










himself and his father. 



















They were talking about this when Ram said, "My father has gone to the dogs!" 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Did you hear that? The father has gone to the dogs and the son 










is all right!" 



















RAM: "There is no peace when my stepmother comes home. There is always some trouble 










or other. Our family is about to break up. So I say, let her live with her father." 



















GIRINDRA (to Ram): "Why don't you too keep your wife at her father's home?" (Laughter.) 



















MASTER (smiling): "Are husband and wife like earthen pots or jars, that you may keep the 










pot in one place and the lid in another? Shiva in one place and Sakti in another?" 



















RAM: "Sir, we are quite happy. But when she comes the family is broken up. If such is the 



















case-" 





































OUR DUTIES TO FATHER AND MOTHER 



















MASTER: "Then build them a separate home. That will be a different thing. You will defray 










their monthly expenses. How worthy of worship one's parents are! Rakhal asked me if he could 










take the food left on his father's plate. 'What do you mean?' I said. 'What have you become that 










you cannot?' But it is also true that good people won't give anyone, even a dog, the food from 










their plates." 



















GIRINDRA: "Sir, suppose one's parents are guilty of a terrible crime, a heinous sin?" 



















MASTER: "What if they are? You must not renounce your mother even if she commits 










adultery. The woman guru of a certain family became corrupt. The members of the family said that 










they would like to make the son of the guru their spiritual guide. But I said: 'How is that? Will you 










accept the shoot and give up the yam? Suppose she is corrupt; still you must regard her as your 










Ishta. 'Though my guru visits the tavern, still to me he is the holy Nityananda.' " 



















"Are father and mother mere trifles? No spiritual practice will bear fruit unless they are 










pleased. Chaitanya was intoxicated with the love of God. Still, before taking to the monastic life, 










for how many days did he try to persuade his mother to give him her permission to become a 










monk! He said to her: 'Mother, don't worry. I shall visit you every now and then.' 



















(To M., reproachfully) "And let me say this to you. Your father and mother brought you up. 










You yourself are the father of several children. Yet you have left home with your wife. You have 










cheated your parents. You have come away with your wife and children, and you feel you have 










become a holy man. Your father doesn't need any money from you; otherwise I should have cried, 










'Shame on you!'" 



















Everybody in the room became grave and remained silent. 



















MASTER: "A man has certain debts to pay: his debts to the gods and rishis, and his debts to 










mother, father, and wife. He cannot achieve anything without paying the debt he owes to his 










parents. A man is indebted to his wife as well. Harish has renounced his wife and is living here. If 










he had left her unprovided for, then I should have called him an abominable wretch. 



















"After attaining Knowledge you will regard that very wife as the manifestation of the Divine 










Mother Herself. It is written in the Chandi, 'The Goddess dwells in all beings as the Mother.' It is 










She who has become your mother. 



















"All the women you see are only She, the Divine Mother. That is why I cannot rebuke even 










Brinde, the maidservant. There are people who spout verses from the scriptures and talk big, but 










in their conduct they are quite different. Ramprasanna is constantly busy procuring opium and 










milk for the hathayogi. He says that Manu enjoins it upon man to serve the Sadhu. But his old 










mother hasn't enough to eat. She walks to the market to buy her own groceries. It makes me very 










angry. 



















THROUGH DIVINE LOVE MAN TRANSCENDS HIS WORLDLY DUTIES 



















"But here you have to consider another thing. When a man is intoxicated with ecstatic love 










of God, then who is his father or mother or wife? His love of God is so intense that he becomes 





































mad with it. Then he has no duty to perform. He is free from all debts. What is this divine 










intoxication? In this state a man forgets the world. He also forgets his own body, which is so dear 










to all. Chaitanya had this intoxication. He plunged into the ocean not knowing that it was the 










ocean. He dashed himself again and again on the ground. He was not aware of hunger, of thirst, or 










of sleep. He was not at all conscious of any such thing as his body." 



















All at once Sri Ramakrishna exclaimed, "Ah, Chaitanya!" and stood up. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Chaitanya means 'Undivided Consciousness'. 



















Vaishnavcharan used to say that Gauranga was like a bubble in the Ocean of Undivided 










Consciousness. 



















(To the elder Gopal) "Do you intend to go on a pilgrimage now?" 










GOPAL: "Yes, sir. I should like to wander about a little." 



















RAM (to Gopal): "He [meaning the Master] says that one becomes a kutichaka after being a 










vahudaka. The Sadhu that visits many holy places is called a vahudaka. He whose craving for travel 










has been satiated and who sits down in one place is called a kutichaka. 



















"He also tells us a parable. Once a bird sat on the mast of a ship. When the ship sailed 










through the mouth of the Ganges into the 'black waters' of the ocean, the bird failed to notice the 










fact. When it finally became aware of the ocean, it left the mast and flew north in search of land. 










But it found no limit to the water and so returned. After resting awhile it flew south. There too it 










found no limit to the water. Panting for breath the bird returned to the mast. Again, after resting 










awhile, it flew east and then west. Finding no limit to the Water in any direction, at last it settled 










down on the mast of the ship." 



















MASTER (to the elder Gopal and the other devotees): "As long as a man feels that God is 










'there', he is ignorant. But he attains Knowledge when he feels that God is 'here'. 



















"A man wanted a smoke. He went to a neighbour's house to light his charcoal. It was the 










dead of night and the household was asleep. After he had knocked a great deal, someone came 










down to open the door. At sight of the man he asked, 'Hello! What's the matter?' The man replied: 










'Can't you guess? You know how fond I am of smoking. I have come here to light my charcoal.' The 










neighbour said: 'Ha! Ha! You are a fine man indeed! You took the trouble to come and do all this 










knocking at the door! Why, you have a lighted lantern in your hand!' (All laugh.) 



















"What a man seeks is very near him. Still he wanders about from place to place." 



















RAM: "Sir, I now realize why a guru asks some of his disciples to visit the four principal holy 










places of the country. Once having wandered about, the disciple discovers that it is the same here 










as there. Then he returns to the guru. All this wandering is only to create faith in the guru's 










words." 





































After this conversation had come to an end, Sri Ramakrishna extolled Ram's virtues. 





































MASTER (to the devotees): "How many fine qualities Ram possesses! How many devotees 










he serves and looks after! (To Ram) Adhar told me that you showed him great kindness." 



















Adhar, a beloved householder devotee of the Master, had recently arranged some religious 










music at his house. The Master and many devotees had been present. But Adhar had forgotten to 










invite Ram, who was a very proud man and had complained about it to his friends. So Adhar had 










gone to Ram's house to express his regret for the mistake. 



















RAM: "It wasn't really Adhar's mistake. I have come to know that Rakhal is to blame. Rakhal 










was given charge-" 



















MASTER: "You mustn't find fault with Rakhal. He's a mere child. Even now you can bring out 










his mother's milk by squeezing his throat." 



















RAM: "Sir, why should you speak that way? It was such an occasion!" 



















MASTER: (interrupting): "Adhar simply didn't remember to invite you. He is absentminded. 










The other day he went with me to Jadu Mallick's house. As we took our leave, I said to him, 'You 










haven't offered anything to the Goddess in the chapel' 'Sir,' he said, 'I didn't know one should.' 



















(To Ram) "Suppose he didn't invite you to his house. Why such a fuss about going to a place 










where the name of the Lord was sung? One may go unasked to participate in religious music. One 










doesn't have to be invited." 



















ADVICE TO AN ACTOR 



















Saturday, May 24, 1884 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting on the small couch in his room. Rakhal , M., and, several 










other devotees were present. A special worship of Kali had been performed in the temple the 










previous night. In connection with the worship a theatrical performance of the Vidyasundar had 










been staged in the Natmandir. The Master had watched a part of it that morning. The actors came 










to his room to pay him their respects. The Master, in a happy mood, became engaged in 










conversation with a fair complexioned young man who had taken the part of Vidya and played his 










part very well. 



















MASTER (to the actor): "Your acting was very good. If a person excels in singing, music, 










dancing, or any other art, he can also quickly realize God provided he strives sincerely. 



















"Just as you practise much in order to sing, dance, and play on instruments, so one should 










practise the art of fixing the mind on God. One should practise regularly such disciplines as 










worship, japa, and meditation. 



















"Are you married? Any children?" 



















ACTOR: "Yes, sir. I had a girl who died. Another child has been born." 



















MASTER: "Ah! A death and a birth, and all so quickly! You are so young! There is a saying: 










'My husband died just after our marriage. There are so many nights for me to weep!' You are no 





































doubt realizing the nature of worldly happiness. The world is like a hog plum. The hog plum has 










only pit and skin, and after eating it you suffer from colic. 



















"You are an actor in the theatre. That's fine. But it is a very painful profession. You are 










young now; so you have a full, round face. Afterwards there will be hollows in your cheeks. Almost 










all actors become like that; they get hollow cheeks and big bellies. (Laughter.) 



















"Why did I stay to watch your performance? I found the rhythm, the music, and the melody 










all correct. Then the Divine Mother showed me that it was God alone who acted in the 










performance in the roles of the players." 



















ACTOR: "Sir, what is the difference between lust and desire?" 



















MASTER: "Lust is like the root of the tree, and desires are branches and twigs. 



















Passions should be directed to God 



















"One cannot completely get rid of the six passions: lust, anger, greed, and the like. 










Therefore one should direct them to God. If you must have desire and greed, then you should 










desire love of God and be greedy to attain Him. If you must be conceited and egotistic, then feel 










conceited and egotistic thinking that you are the servant of God, the child of God. 



















"A man cannot see God unless he gives his whole mind to Him. The mind is wasted on 










'woman and gold'. Take your own case. You have children and are occupied with the theatre. The 










mind cannot be united with God on account of these different activities. 



















"As long as there is bhoga, there will be less of yoga. Furthermore, bhoga begets suffering. 










It is said in the Bhagavata that the Avadhuta chose a kite as one of his twenty-four gurus. The kite 










had a fish in its beak; so it was surrounded by a thousand crows. Whichever way it flew with the 










fish, the crows pursued it crying, 'Caw! Caw!' When all of a sudden the fish dropped from its beak, 










the crows flew after the fish, leaving the kite alone. 



















"The 'fish' is the object of enjoyment. The 'crows' are worries and anxiety. Worries and 










anxiety are inevitable with enjoyment. No sooner does one give up enjoyment than one finds 










peace. 



















MONEY IS THE SOURCE OF TROUBLE 



















"What is more, money itself becomes a source of trouble. Brothers may live happily, but 










they get into trouble when the property is divided. Dogs lick one another's bodies; they are 










perfectly friendly. But when the house-holder throws them a little food, they get into a scrap. 



















"Come here now and then. (Pointing to M. and the others) They come here on Sundays and 










other holidays." 



















ACTOR: "We have holidays for three months, during the rainy and harvest seasons. It is our 










good fortune to be able to visit you. On our way to Dakshineswar we heard of two persons- 










yourself and Jnanarnava." 





































MASTER: "Be on friendly terms with your brothers. It looks well. You must have noticed in 










your theatrical performance that if four singers sing each in a different way, the play is spoiled." 



















Actor: "Yes, sir. Many birds are trapped in a net; if they all fly together and drag the net in 










one direction, then many of them may be saved. But that doesn't happen if they try to fly in 










different directions. 



















"One also sees in a theatrical performance a person keeping a pitcher of water on his head 










and at the same time dancing about." 



















DO YOUR DUTIES AND REMEMBER GOD 



















MASTER: "Live in the world but keep the pitcher steady on your head; that is to say, keep 










the mind firmly on God. 



















"I once said to the sephoys from the barracks: 'Do your duty in the world but remember 










that the "pestle of death" will some time smash your hand. Be alert about it.' 



















"In Kamarpukur I have seen the women of carpenter families making flattened rice with a 










husking-machine. One woman kicks the end of the wooden beam, and another woman, while 










nursing her baby, turns the paddy in the mortar dug in the earth. The second woman is always 










alert lest the pestle of the machine should fall on her hand. With the other hand she fries the 










soaked paddy in a pan. Besides, she is talking with customers; she says: 'You owe us so much 










money. Please pay it before you go.' Likewise, do your different duties in the world, fixing your 










mind on God. But practice is necessary, and one should also be alert. Only in this way can one 










safeguard both— God and the world." 



















MASTER: "Proof? God can be seen. By practising spiritual discipline one sees God, through 










His grace. The rishis directly realized the Self. One cannot know the truth about God through 










science. Science gives us information only about things perceived by the senses, as for instance: 










this material mixed with that material gives such and such a result, and that material mixed with 










this material gives such and such a result. 



















"For this reason a man cannot comprehend spiritual things with his ordinary intelligence. To 










understand them he must live in the company of holy persons. You learn to feel the pulse by living 










with a physician." 



















ACTOR: "Yes, sir. Now I understand." 



















MASTER: "You must practise tapasya. Only then can you attain the goal. It will avail you 










nothing even if you learn the texts of the scriptures by heart. You cannot become intoxicated by 










merely saying 'siddhi' over and over. You must swallow some. 



















"One cannot explain the vision of God to others. One cannot explain conjugal happiness to a 










child five years old." 



















ACTOR: "How does One realize the Atman?" 





































Just then Rakhal was about to take his meal in the Master's room. He hesitated at the sight 










of so many people. During those days the Master looked on Rakhal as Gopala and on himself as 










Mother Yasoda. 



















MASTER (to Rakhal): "Why don't you eat? Let the people stand aside if you wish it. (To a 










devotee) Keep some ice for Rakhal. (To Rakhal) Do you intend to go to Vanhooghly? Don't go in 










this sun." 



















Rakhal sat down to his meal. Sri Ramakrishna again spoke to the actor. 



















MASTER: "Why didn't all of you take your meal from the kitchen of the Kali temple? That 










would have been nice." 



















ACTOR: "All of us don't have the same opinion about food; so our food is cooked separately. 










All don't like to eat in the guest-house." 



















While Rakhal was taking his meal, the Master and the devotees sat on the porch and 










continued their conversation. 



















MEANS OF SELF-REALIZATION 



















MASTER (to the actor): "You asked me about Self-realization. Longing is the means of 










realizing Atman. A man must strive to attain God with all his body, with all his mind, and with all 










his speech. Because of an excess of bile one gets jaundice. Then one sees everything as yellow; one 










perceives no colour but yellow. Among you actors, those who take only the roles of women 










acquire the nature of a woman; by thinking of woman your ways and thoughts become womanly. 










Just so, by thinking day and night of God one acquires the nature of God. 



















"The mind is like white linen just returned from the laundry. It takes on the colour you dip it 



















in." 



















ACTOR: "But it must first be sent to the laundry." 



















MASTER: "Yes. First is the purification of the mind. Afterwards, if you direct the mind to the 










contemplation of God, it will be coloured by God-Consciousness. Again, if you direct the mind to 










worldly duties, such as the acting of a play, it will be coloured by worldliness." 



















Sri Ramakrishna had rested on his bed only a few minutes when Hari, Narayan, Narendra 










Bannerji, and other devotees arrived from Calcutta and saluted him. Narendra Bannerji was the 










son of the professor of Sanskrit at the Presidency College of Calcutta. Because of friction with 










other members of the family, he had rented a separate house where he lived with his wife and 










children. Narendra was a very simple and guileless man. He practised spiritual discipline and, at 










the time of meditation, heard various sounds-the sound of a gong, and so on. He had travelled in 










different parts of India and he visited the Master now and then. 



















Narayan was a school boy sixteen or seventeen years old. He often visited the Master, who 










was very fond of him. 





































Hari lived with his brothers at their Baghbazar house. He had studied up to the 










matriculation class in the General Assembly Institution. Then he had given up his studies and 










devoted his time at home to the contemplation of God, the reading of the scriptures, and the 










practice of yoga. He also visited the Master now and then. 



















Sri Ramakrishna often sent for Hari when he went to Balaram's house in Baghbazar. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "I have heard a great deal about Buddha. He is one of the ten 










Incarnations of God. 2 Brahman is immovable, immutable, inactive, and of the nature of 










Consciousness. When a man merges his buddhi, his intelligence, in Bodha, 



















Consciousness, then he attains the Knowledge of Brahman; he becomes buddha, 










enlightened. 



















"Nangta used to say that the mind merges in the buddhi, and the buddhi in Bodha, 










Consciousness. 



















"The aspirant does not attain the Knowledge of Brahman as long as he is conscious of his 










ego. The ego comes under one's control after one has obtained the Knowledge of Brahman and 










seen God. Otherwise the ego cannot be controlled. It is difficult to catch one's own shadow. But 










when the sun is overhead, the shadow is within a few inches of the body." 



















A DEVOTEE: "What is the vision of God like?" 



















MASTER: "Haven't you seen a theatrical performance? The people are engaged in 










conversation, when suddenly the curtain goes up. Then the entire mind of the audience is directed 










to the play. The people don't look at other things any longer. Samadhi is to go within oneself like 










that. When the curtain is rung down, people look around again. Just so, when the, curtain of maya 










falls, the mind becomes externalized. 



















(To Narendra Bannerji) "You have travelled a great deal. Tell us some thing about the 










sadhus." 



















Narendra told the story of two yogis in Bhutan who used to drink daily a pound of the bitter 










juice of neem-leaves. He had also visited the hermitage of a holy man on the bank of the Narmada. 










At the sight of the Bengali Babu dressed in European clothes, the sadhu had remarked, "He has a 










knife hidden under his clothes, next to his belly." 



















KEEPING THE PICTURES OF HOLY PERSONS 



















MASTER: "One should keep pictures of holy men in one's room. That constantly quickens 










divine ideas." 



















BANNERJI: "I have your picture in my room; also the picture of a sadhu living in the 










mountains, blowing on a piece of lighted charcoal, in a bowl of hemp." 



















MASTER: "It is true that one's spiritual feelings are awakened by looking at the picture of a 










sadhu. It is like being reminded of the custard-apple by looking at an imitation one, or like 





































stimulating the desire for enjoyment by looking at a young woman. Therefore I tell you that you 










should constantly live in the company of holy men. 



















(To Bannerji) "You know very well the suffering of the world. You suffer whenever you 










accept enjoyment. As long as the kite kept the fish in its beak, it was tormented by the flock of 










crows. 



















"One finds peace of mind in the company of holy men. The alligator remains under water a 










long time. But every now and then it rises to the surface and breathes with a deep wheezing noise. 










Then it gives a sigh of relief." 



















ACTOR: "Revered sir, what you have just said about enjoyment is very true. One ultimately 










courts disaster if one prays to God for enjoyment. Various desires come to the mind and by no 










means all of them are good. God is the Kalpataru, the Wish-fulfilling Tree. A man gets whatever he 










asks of God. Suppose it comes to his mind: 'God is the Kalpataru. Well, let me see if a tiger will 










appear before me.' Because he thinks of the tiger, it really appears and devours him." 



















MASTER: "Yes, you must remember that the tiger comes. What more shall I tell you? Keep 










your mind on God. Don't forget Him. God will certainly reveal Himself to you if you pray to Him 










with sincerity. Another thing, Sing the name of God at the end of each performance. Then the 










actors, the singers, and the audience will go home with the thought of God in their minds." 



















The actors saluted the Master and took their leave. 



















Two ladies, devotees of Sri Ramakrishna, entered the room and saluted the Master. They 










had been fasting in preparation for this visit. They were sisters-in-law, the wives of two brothers, 










and were twenty-two or twenty-three years old. They were mothers of children. Both of them had 










their faces covered with veils. 



















MASTER (to the ladies): "Worship Siva. This worship is described in a book called the 










Nityakarma. Learn the rituals from it. In order to perform the worship of God you will be 










preoccupied for a longtime with such religious duties as plucking flowers, making sandal-paste, 










polishing the utensils of worship, and arranging offerings. As you perform these duties your mind 










will naturally be directed to God. You will get rid of meanness, anger, jealousy, and so forth. When 










you two sisters talk to each other, always talk about spiritual matters. 



















"The thing is somehow to unite the mind with God. You must not forget Him, not even 










once. Your thought of Him should be like the flow of oil, without any interruption. If you worship 










with love even a brick or stone as God, then through His grace you can see Him. 



















"Remember what I have just said to you. One should perform such worship as the Siva Puja. 










Once the mind has become mature, one doesn't have to continue formal worship for long. The 










mind then always remains united with God; meditation and contemplation become a constant 










habit of mind." 



















ELDER SISTER-IN-LAW: "Will you please give us some instruction?" 





































MASTER (affectionately): "I don't give initiation. If a guru gives initiation he must assume 










responsibility for the disciple's sin and suffering. The Divine Mother has placed me in the state of a 










child. Perform the Siva Puja as I told you. Come here now and then. We shall see what happens 










later on through the will of God. I asked you to chant the name of Hari at home. Are you doing 










that?" 



















ELDER SISTER-IN-LAW: "Yes." 



















MASTER: "Why have you fasted? You should take your meal before you come here. Women 










are but so many forms of my Divine Mother. I cannot bear to see them suffer; You are all images of 










the Mother of the Universe. Come here after you have eaten, and you will feel happy." 



















Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna asked Ramlal to give the ladies some food. They were given 










fruit, sweets, drinks, and other offerings from the temple. 



















The Master said: "You have eaten something. Now my mind is at peace. I cannot bear to see 










women fast." 



















It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of the 










Siva temples. Adhar, Dr. Nitai, M., and several other devotees were with him. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "I want to tell you something. A change has been coming over 










my nature." 



















The Master came down a step and sat near the devotees. It seemed that he intended to 










communicate some of his deeper experiences to them. 



















GOD IN HUMAN FORMS 



















MASTER: "You are devotees. I have no hesitation in telling you this. Nowadays I don't see 










the Spirit-form of God. He is revealed to me in human form. It is my nature to see the form of God, 










to touch and embrace Him. God is saying to me, 'You have assumed a body; therefore enjoy God 










through His human forms.' 



















"God no doubt dwells in all, but He manifests Himself more through man than through 










other beings. Is man an insignificant thing? He can think of God, he can think of the Infinite, while 










other living beings cannot. God exists in other living beings-animals, plants, nay, in all beings-, but 










He manifests Himself more through man than through these others. Fire exists in all beings, in all 










things; but its presence is felt more in wood. Rama said to Lakshmana: 'Look at the elephant, 










brother. He is such a big animal, but he cannot think of God.' 



















DIVINE INCARNATION 



















"But in the Incarnation there is a greater manifestation of God than in other men. Rama 










said to Lakshmana, 'Brother, if you see in a man ecstatic love of God, if he laughs, weeps, and 










dances in divine ecstasy, then know for certain that I dwell in him." 



















The Master remained silent. After a few minutes he resumed the conversation. 





































MASTER AND KESHAB 



















MASTER: "Keshab Sen used to come here frequently. As a result he changed a great deal. Of 










late he became quite a remarkable man. Many a time he came here with his party; but he also 










wanted to come alone. In the earlier years of his life Keshab didn't have much opportunity to live 










in the company of holy men. 



















"I visited him at his house in Colootola Street. Hriday was with me. We were shown into the 










room where Keshab was working. He was writing something. After a long while he put aside his 










pen, got off his chair, and sat on the floor with us. But he didn't salute us or show us respect in any 










other way. 



















"He used to come here now and then. One day in a spiritual mood I said to him: 'One should 










not sit before a sadhu with one leg over the other. That increases one's rajas.' As soon as he and 










his friends would arrive, I would salute them before they bowed to me. Thus they gradually learnt 










to salute a holy man, touching the ground with their foreheads. 



















"I said to Keshab: 'Chant the name of Hari. In the Kaliyuga one should sing the name and 










glories of God.' After that they began to sing the name of God with drums and cymbals. "Do you 










know how my faith in the name of Hari was all the more strengthened? Holy men, as you know, 










frequently visit the temple garden. Once a sadhu from Multan arrived. He was waiting for a party 










going to Gangasagar. (Pointing to M.) The sadhu was of his age. It was he who said to me, 'The way 










to realize God in the Kaliyuga is the path of bhakti as prescribed by Narada.' 



















"One day Keshab came here with his followers. They stayed till ten at night. We were all 










seated in the Panchavati. Pratap and several others said they would like to spend the night here. 










Keshab said: 'No, I must go. I have some work to do.' I laughed and said: 'Can't you sleep without 










the smell of your fish-basket? 



















Once a fishwife was a guest in the house of a gardener who raised flowers. She came there 










with her empty basket, after selling fish in the market, and was asked to sleep in a room where 










flowers were kept. But, because of the fragrance of the flowers, she couldn't get to sleep for a long 










time. Her hostess saw her condition and said, "Hello! Why are you tossing from side to side so 










restlessly?" The fishwife said: "I don't know, friend. Perhaps the smell of the flowers has been 










disturbing my sleep. Can you give me my fish-basket? Perhaps that will put me to sleep." 



















The basket was brought to her. She sprinkled water on it and set it near her nose. Then she 










fell sound asleep and snored all night.' 



















"At this story the followers of Keshab burst into loud laughter. 



















GOD, THE SCRIPTURE, AND THE DEVOTEE ARE IDENTICAL 



















"Keshab conducted the prayer that evening at the bathing-ghat on the river. After the 










worship I said to him: 'It is God who manifests Himself, in one aspect, as the scriptures; therefore 










one should worship the sacred books, such as the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras. In another 










aspect He has become the devotee. The heart of the devotee is God's drawing-room. One can 





































easily find one's master in the drawing-room. Therefore, by worshipping His devotee, one 










worships God Himself.' 



















"Keshab and his followers listened to my words with great attention. It was a full-moon 










night. The sky was flooded with light. We were seated in the open court at the top of the stairs 










leading to the river. I said, 'Now let us all chant, "Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan." ' All chanted in 










unison, 'Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan.' Next I said to them, 'Say, "Brahman is verily Sakti; Sakti is 










verily Brahman." ' Again they chanted in unison. 'Brahman is verily Sakti; Sakti is verily Brahman.' I 










said to them: 'He whom you address as Brahma is none other than She whom I call Mother. 










Mother is a very sweet name.' 



















"Then I said to them, 'Say, "Guru-Krishna-Vaishnava."' At this Keshab said: 'We must not go 










so far, sir. If we do that, then all will take us for orthodox Vaishnavas.' 



















BRAHMAN AND SAKTI 



















"I used to tell Keshab now and then: 'He whom you address as Brahma is none other than 










She whom I call Sakti, the Primal Energy. It is called Brahman in the Vedas when it transcends 










speech and thought and is without attributes and action. I call it Sakti, Adyasakti, and so forth, 










when I find it creating, preserving, and destroying the universe.' 



















DIFFICULTIES OF HOUSEHOLDER'S LIFE 



















"I said to Keshab: 'It is extremely difficult to realize God while leading a worldly life. How 










can a typhoid patient be cured if he is kept in a room where tamarind, pickle, and jars of water are 










kept? Therefore one should go into solitude now and then to practise spiritual discipline. When 










the trunk of a tree becomes thick and strong, an elephant can be tied to it; but a young sapling is 










eaten by cattle.' That is why Keshab would say in his lectures, 'Live in the world after being 










strengthened in spiritual life.' 



















(To the devotees) "You see, Keshab was a great scholar. He lectured in English. Many people 










honoured him. Queen Victoria herself talked to him. But when Keshab came here he would be 










bare-bodied and bring some fruit, as one should when visiting a holy man. He was totally free from 










egotism. 



















(To Adhar) "You are a scholar and a deputy magistrate, but with all that you are henpecked. 










Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandal-wood there are many more valuable things: silver-mines, 










gold-mines, diamonds, and other gems. The wood-cutter was chopping wood in the forest; the 










brahmachari said to him, 'Go forward.' " 



















Sri Ramakrishna came down from the steps of the Siva temples and went to his own room 










through the courtyard. The devotees were with him. Just then Ram Chatterji came and said that 










the Holy Mother's attendant had had an attack of cholera. 



















RAM (to the Master): "I told you about it at ten o'clock this morning, but you didn't pay any 










attention to me." 





































MASTER: "What could I do?" 





































RAM: "Yes, what could you do! But there were Rakhal, Ramlal, and others. Even they didn't 










pay any attention." 



















M: "Kishori has gone to Alambazar to get medicine." 



















MASTER: "Alone? Where will he get medicine?" 



















M: "Yes, alone. He will get it at Alambazar." 



















MASTER (to M.): "Tell the nurse what to do if the illness takes a turn for the worse or if the 










patient feels better." 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















The ladies mentioned before saluted the Master and were about to take their leave. Sri 










Ramakrishna again said to them: "Perform the Siva Puja according to my instruction. And have 










something to eat before you come here. Otherwise I shall feel unhappy. Come another day." 



















Sri Ramakrishna sat down on the porch west of his room. Narendra Bannerji, Hari, M., and 










others sat by his side. The Master knew about Narendra's family difficulties. 



















MASTER: "You see, all these sufferings are 'because of a piece of loin cloth'. A man takes a 










wife and begets children; therefore he must secure a job. The sadhu is worried about his 










loin-cloth, and the householder about his wife. Further, the householder may not live on good 










terms with his relatives; so he must live separately with his wife. (With a laugh) Chaitanya once 










said to Nityananda: 'Listen to me, brother. A man entangled in worldliness can never be free.' " 



















M. (to himself): "Perhaps the Master is referring to the world of avidya. It is the world of 










avidya that entangles a householder." 



















M. was still living in a separate house with his wife, on account of a misunderstanding with 










the other members of his family. 



















MASTER (to Bannerji, pointing to M.): "He also lives in a separate house. You two will get 










along very well. Once two men happened to meet. One said to the other, 'Who are you?' 'Oh, I am 










away from my country', was the other's reply. The second man then asked the first, 'And who are 










you, pray?' 'Oh, I am away from my beloved', was the answer. Both were in the same plight; so 










they got along very well. (All laugh.) 



















"But one need not have any fear if one takes refuge in God. God protects His devotee." 



















HARI: "Well, why does it take many people such a long time to realize Him?" 



















MASTER: "The truth is that a man doesn't feel restless for God unless he is finished with his 










enjoyments and duties. The physician says, referring to the patient: 'Let a few days pass first. Then 










a little medicine will do him good.' 



















"Narada said to Rama: 'Rama, You are passing your time in Ayhodhya. How will Ravana be 










killed? You have taken this human body for that purpose alone.' Rama replied: 'Narada, let the 





































right time come. Let Ravana's past actions begin to bear fruit. Then everything will be made ready 










for his death.' " 



















HARI: "Why is there so much suffering in the world?" 



















MASTER: "This world is the Ilia of God. It is like a game. In this game there are joy and 










sorrow, virtue and vice, knowledge and ignorance, good and evil. The game cannot continue if sin 










and suffering are altogether eliminated from the creation. 



















"In the game of hide-and-seek one must touch the 'granny' in order to be free. But the 










'granny' is never pleased if she is touched at the very outset. It is God's wish that the play should 










continue for some time. Then-Out of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free; 










And Thou dost laugh and clap Thy hands, Mother, watching them! 



















In other words, after the practice of hard spiritual discipline, one or two have the vision of 










God, through His grace, and are liberated. Then the Divine Mother claps Her hands in joy and 










exclaims, 'Bravo! There they go!' " 



















HARI: "But this play of God is our death." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Please tell me who you are. God alone has become all this-maya, the 










universe, living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles. 'As the snake I bite, and as the 










charmer I cure.' It is God Himself who has become both vidya and avidya. He remains deluded by 










the maya of avidya, ignorance. Again, with the help of the guru, He is cured by the maya of vidya, 










Knowledge. 



















"Ignorance, Knowledge, and Perfect Wisdom. The Jnani sees that God alone exists and is the 










Doer, that He creates, preserves, and destroys. The vijnani sees that it is God who has become all 










this. 



















"After attaining mahabhava and prema one realizes that nothing exists but God. Bhakti 










pales before bhava. Bhava ripens into mahabhava and prema. 



















(To Bannerji) "Do you still hear that gong-like sound at the time of meditation?" 



















BANNERJI: "Yes, sir. Every day. Besides, I have visions of God's form. Do such things stop 










after the mind has once experienced them?" 



















MASTER: "True. Once the wood catches fire, it cannot be put out. (To the devotees) He 










knows many things about faith." 



















BANNERJI: "I have too much faith." 



















MASTER: "Bring the women of your family with those of Balaram's." 










BANNERJI: "Who is Balaram?" 



















MASTER: "Don't you know Balaram? He lives at Bosepara." 





































Sri Ramakrishna loved guileless people. Narendra Bannerji was absolutely guileless. The 










Master loved Niranjan because he, too, was without guile. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Why do I ask you to see Niranjan? It is to find out if he is truly guileless." 



















Sunday, May 25, 1884 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the cement platform that encircled the trunk of the old 










banyan-tree in the Panchavati. Vijay, Surendra, Bhavanath, Rakhal , and other devotees were 










present, a few of them sitting with the Master on the platform, the rest on the ground below. The 










devotees had thought of celebrating the Master's birthday, which had had to be put off because of 










his illness. Since Sri Ramakrishna now felt much better, the devotees wanted to have the 










celebration that day. A woman musician, a famous singer of kirtan, was going to entertain them 










with devotional songs. 



















It was one o'clock in the afternoon. M. had been looking for Sri Ramakrishna in the Master's 










room. When he did not find him there, he went to the Panchavati and eagerly asked the devotees, 










"Where is he?" He was standing right in front of the Master but in his excitement did not notice 










him. The devotees laughed loudly. A moment later M. saw Sri Ramakrishna and felt very much 










embarrassed. He prostrated himself before the Master, who sat there facing the south and smiling 










happily. Kedar and Vijay were sitting at his left. These two devotees had had a misunderstanding 










recently when Kedar had cut off his connexion with the Brahmo Samaj. 



















MASTER (to M., with a smile): "You see how I have united them?" The Master had brought a 










madhavi creeper from Vrindavan in the year 1868 and had planted it in the Panchavati. The 










creeper had grown big and strong. Some children were jumping and swinging from it. The Master 










observed them and laughed. He said: "They are like young monkeys. They will not give up swinging 










even though they sometimes fall to the ground." Noticing that Surendra was standing before him, 










the Master said to him affectionately: "Come up and sit with us on the platform. Then you can 










dangle your feet comfortably." Surendra went up and took his seat. Bhavanath had his coat on. 










Surendra said to him, "Are you going to England?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "God is our England. Now and then I used to leave off my clothes and 










joyfully roam about naked. Once Sambhu said to me: 'It is very comfortable to walk about naked. 










That is why you do it. Once I did it myself.' " 



















SURENDRA: "On returning from the office, as I put away my coat and trousers, I say to the 










Divine Mother, '0 Mother, how tightly You have bound me to the world!' " 



















MASTER: "There are eight fetters with which man is bound: shame; hatred, fear, pride of 










caste, hesitation, the desire to conceal, and so forth." 



















Sri Ramakrishna sang: 



















Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart, that even with Thee for Mother, and 










though I am wide awake, There should be robbery in my house. . . . 





































He continued: 





































In the world's busy market-place, Syama, Thou art flying kites; High up they soar on the 










wind of hope, held fast by maya's string. Their frames are human skeletons, their sails of the three 










gunas made; but all their curious workmanship is merely for ornament. Upon the kite-strings Thou 










hast rubbed the manja-paste of worldliness, So as to make each straining strand all the more sharp 










and strong. Out of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free; And Thou does 










laugh and clap Thy hands, Mother, watching them! On favouring winds, says Ramprasad, the 










kites set loose will speedily Be borne away to the Infinite, across the sea of the world. 



















MASTER: '"Maya's string' means wife and children. 



















Upon the kite-strings Thou hast rubbed the manja-paste of worldliness. 



















'Worldliness' means 'woman and gold'. 



















THE THREE GUNAS 



















"The three gunas— sattva, rajas, and tamas— have men under their control. They are like 










three brothers: As long as sattva exists, it calls on rajas for help; and rajas can get help from tamas. 










The three gunas are so many robbers. Tamas kills and rajas binds. Sattva no doubt releases man 










from his bondage, but it cannot take him to God." 



















VIJAY (smiling): "It is because sattva, too, is a robber." 



















MASTER (smiling): "True. Sattva cannot take man to God, but it shows him the way." 










BHAVANATH: "These are wonderful words indeed." 










MASTER: "Yes, This is a lofty thought." 



















Listening to these words of the Master, the devotees felt very happy. 










The bondage of "woman and gold" 



















MASTER: '"Woman and gold' is the cause of bondage. 'Woman and gold' alone constitutes 










samsara, the world. It is 'woman and gold' that keeps one from seeing God. (Holding the towel in 










front of his face) Do you see my face any more? Of course not. The towel hides it. No sooner is the 










covering of 'woman and gold' removed than one attains Chidananca, Consciousness and Bliss. 



















CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF LUST 



















"Let me tell you something. He who has renounced the pleasure of a wife has verily 










renounced the pleasure of the world. God is very near to such a person." 



















The devotees listened to these words in silence. 



















MASTER (to Kedar, Vijay, and the other devotees): "He who has renounced the pleasure of a 










wife has verily renounced the pleasure of the world. It is 'woman and gold' that hides God. You 










people have such imposing moustaches, and yet you too are involved in 'woman and gold'. Tell me 










if it isn't true. Search your heart and answer me." 





































VIJAY: "Yes, it is true." 





































Kedar remained silent. 



















MASTER: "I see that all are under the control of woman. One day I went to Captain's house. 










From there I was to go to Ram's house. So I said to Captain, 'Please give me my carriage hire.' He 










asked his wife about it. She too held back and said: 'What's the matter? What's the matter?' At last 










Captain said, 'Ram will take care of it.' You see, the Gita, the Bhagavata, and the Vedanta all bow 










before a woman! (All laugh.) 



















"A man leaves his money, his property, and everything in the hands of his wife. But he says 










with affected simplicity, 'I have such a nature that I cannot keep even two rupees with me.' 



















"A man went to an office in search of a job. There were many vacancies, but the manager 










did not grant his request. A friend said to the applicant, 'Appeal to Golapi, and you will get the job.' 










Golapi was the manager's mistress. 



















"Men do not realize how far they are dragged down by women. Once I went to the Fort in a 










carriage, feeling all the while that I was going along a level road. At last I found that I had gone four 










storeys down. It was a sloping road. 



















"A man possessed by a ghost does not know he is under the ghost's control. He thinks he is 










quite normal." 



















VIJAY (smiling): "But he can be cured by an exorcist if he finds one." 



















In answer to Vijay Sri Ramakrishna only said, "That depends on the will of God." Then he 










went on with his talk about women. 



















MASTER: "Everyone I talk to says, 'Yes, sir, my wife is good.' Nobody says that his wife is 










bad. (All laugh.) Those who constantly live with 'woman and gold' are so infatuated with it that 










they don't see things properly. Chess-players oftentimes cannot see the right move for their pieces 










on the board. But those who watch the game from a distance can understand the moves more 










accurately. 



















"Woman is the embodiment of maya. In the course of his hymn to Rama, Narada said: '0 










Rama, all men are parts of Thee. All women are parts of Sita, the personification of Thy maya. 










Please deign to grant that I may have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet and that I may not be deluded 










by Thy world bewitching maya. I do not want any other favour than that.' " 



















Surendra's younger brother and his nephews were present. The brother worked in an office 










and one of the nephews was studying law. 



















MASTER (to Surendra's relatives): "My advice to you is not to become attached to the 










world. You see, Rakhal now understands what is knowledge and what is ignorance. He can 










discriminate between the Real and the unreal. So I say to him: 'Go home. You may come here once 










in a while and spend a day or two with me.' 



















"Have a friendly relationship with one another. That will be for your good and make you all 










happy. In a theatre the performance goes well only if the musicians sing with one voice. And that 










also gladdens the hearts of the audience. 





































"Do your worldly duties with a part of your mind and direct most of it to God. A sadhu 










should think of God with three quarters of his mind and with one quarter should do his other 










duties. He should be very alert about spiritual things. The snake is very sensitive in its tail. Its whole 










body reacts when it is hurt there. Similarly, the whole life of a sadhu is affected when his 










spirituality is touched." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was going to the pine-grove and asked Gopal of Sinthi to take his umbrella 










to his room. Arrangements had been made in the Panchavati for the kirtan. When the Mister had 










returned and taken his seat again among the devotees, the musician began her song. Suddenly 










there came a rain-storm. The Master went back to his room with the devotees, the musician 










accompanying them to continue her songs there. 



















MASTER (to Gopal): "Have you brought the umbrella?" 



















GOPAL: "No, sir. I forgot all about it while listening to the music." 



















The umbrella had been left in the Panchavati and Gopal hurried to fetch it. 



















MASTER: "I am generally careless, but not to that extent. Rakhal also is very careless. 










Referring to the date of an invitation, he says 'the eleventh' instead of 'the thirteenth'. And 










Gopal-he belongs in a herd of cows!" 



















The musician sang a song about the monastic life of Chaitanya. Now and then she 










improvised lines: "He will not look upon a woman; for that is against the sannyasi's duty." "Eager 










to take away men's sorrows, he will not look upon a woman." "For the Lord's birth as Sri Chaitanya 










otherwise would be in vain." 



















The Master stood up, as he heard about Chaitanya's renunciation, and went into samadhi. 










The devotees put garlands of flowers around his neck. Bhavanath and Rakhal supported his body 










lest he should fall on the ground. Vijay, Kedar, Ram, M., Latu, and the other devotees stood around 










him in a circle, recalling one of the scenes of Chaitanya's kirtan. 



















The Master gradually came down to the sense plane. He was talking to Krishna, now and 










then uttering the word "Krishna". He could not say it very distinctly because of the intensity of his 










spiritual emotion. He said: "Krishna! Krishna! Krishna! Krishna Satchidananda! Nowadays I do not 










see Your form. Now I see You both inside me and outside. I see that it is You who have become the 










universe, all living beings, the twenty-four cosmic principles, and everything else. You alone have 










become mind, intelligence, everything. It is said in the 'Hymn of Salutation to the Guru': 'I bow 










down to the Guru by whose grace I have realized Him who pervades the indivisible universe of the 










animate and the inanimate.' 



















"You alone are the Indivisible. Again, it is You who pervade the universe of the animate and 










the inanimate. You are verily the manifold universe; again, You alone are its basis. Krishna! You 










are my life. Krishna! You are my mind. Krishna! You are my intelligence. Krishna! You are my 










soul. Govinda! You are my life-breath. You are my life itself." 



















Vijay was also in an ecstatic mood. The Master asked him, "My dear sir, have you too 










become unconscious?" "No, sir", said Vijay humbly. 





































The music went on. The musician was singing about the blinding love of God. As she 










improvised the lines: 



















Beloved of my soul! Within the chamber of my heart I would have kept You day and 



















night! 



















The Master again went into samadhi. His injured arm rested on Bhavanath's shoulder. 



















Sri Ramakrishna partly regained outer consciousness. The musician improvised: 



















Why should one who, for Thy sake, has given up everything Endure so much of suffering? 



















The Master bowed to the musician and sat down to listen to the music. Now and then he 










became abstracted. When the musician stopped singing, Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to the 










devotees. 



















PREMA 



















MASTER (to Vijay and the others): "What is prema? He who feels it, this intense and ecstatic 










love of God, not only forgets the world but forgets even the body, which is so dear to all. Chaitanya 










experienced it." 



















The Master explained this to the devotees by singing a song describing the ecstatic state of 










prema: 



















Oh, when will dawn the blessed day When tears of joy will flow from my eyes As I repeat 










Lord Hari's name? . . . 



















The Master began to dance, and the devotees joined him. He caught M. by the arm and 










dragged him into the circle. Thus dancing, Sri Ramakrishna again went into samadhi. Standing 










transfixed, he looked like a picture on canvas. 



















Kedar repeated the following hymn to bring his mind down from the plane of samadhi: 



















We worship the Brahman-Consciousness in the Lotus of the Heart, The Undifferentiated, 










who is adored by Hari, Hara, and Brahma; Who is attained by yogis in the depths of their 










meditation; The Scatterer of the fear of birth and death, The Essence of Knowledge and Truth, the 










Primal Seed of the world. 



















Sri Ramakrishna gradually came back to the plane of normal consciousness. He took his seat 










and chanted the names of God: "Om Satchidananda! Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Yogamaya! 










Bhagavata-Bhakta-Bhagavan!" 



















The Master took dust from the place where the kirtan had been sung and touched it to his 










forehead. 



















A little later Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the semicircular porch facing the Ganges, the 










devotees sitting by his side. Now and then the Master would exclaim, "Ah, Krishnachaitanya!" 





































MASTER (to Vijay and the others): "There has been much chanting of the Lord's name in the 










room. That is why the atmosphere has become so intense." 



















BHAVANATH: "Words of renunciation, too." 



















The Master said, "Ah, how thrilling!" Then he sang about Gauranga and Nityananda : 



















Gora bestows the Nectar of prema; Jar after jar he pours it out, And still there is no end! 










Sweetest Nitai is summoning all; Beloved Gora bids them come; Shantipur is almost drowned, And 










Nadia is flooded with prema! 



















STRICT RULES FOR SANNYASI'S LIFE 



















MASTER (to Vijay and the others): "The musician sang rightly: 'A sannyasi must not look at a 










woman.' This is the sannyasi's dharma. What a lofty ideal!" 



















VIJAY: "Yes indeed, sir." 



















MASTER: "Others learn from the sannyasi's example. That is why such strict rules are 










prescribed for him. A sannyasi must not look even at the portrait of a woman. What a strict rule! 










The slaughtering of a black goat is prescribed for the worship of the Divine Mother; but a goat with 










even a slight wound cannot be offered. A sannyasi must not only not have intercourse with 










woman; he must not even talk to her" 



















VIJAY: "Young Haridas talked with a pious woman. For that reason Chaitanya banished him 










from his presence." 



















MASTER: "A sannyasi associated with 'woman and gold' is like a beautiful damsel with a bad 










odour. The odour makes her beauty useless. 



















"Once a Marwari devotee wanted to give me some money. Mathur wanted to deed me 










some land. But I couldn't accept either. 



















"The rules for the life of a sannyasi are very strict indeed. If a man takes the garb of a 










sannyasi, he must act exactly like one. Haven't you noticed in the theatre that the man who takes 










the part of the king acts like a king, and the man who takes the part of a minister acts like a 










minister? 



















"But on attaining the state of the paramahamsa one becomes like a child. A child five years 










old doesn't know the difference between a man and a woman. But even a paramahamsa must be 










careful, so as not to set a bad example to others." 



















Referring to Keshab's association with "woman and gold", which had hindered his work as a 










spiritual teacher, Sri Ramakrishna said to Vijay, "He-do you understand?" 



















VIJAY: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "He couldn't achieve very much because he wanted to satisfy both God and the 










world." 





































VIJAY: "Chaitanya said to Nityananda: 'Nitai, I shall not be able to do the people any good 










unless I renounce the world. All will imitate me and want to lead the life of a householder. No one 










will try to direct his whole mind to the Lotus Feet of God, renouncing "woman and gold." 



















MASTER: "Yes. Chaitanyadeva renounced the world to set an example to mankind. 



















The sannyasi is a world teacher 



















"The sannyasi must renounce 'woman and gold' for his own welfare. Even if he is 










unattached, and consequently not in danger, still, in order to set an example to others, he must 










not keep 'woman and gold' near him. The sannyasi, the man of renunciation, is a world teacher. It 










is his example that awakens the spiritual consciousness of men." 



















It was nearly dusk. The devotees saluted the Master and took their leave. 



















FESTIVAL AT SURENDRA'S HOUSE 



















Sunday, June 15, 1884 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA arrived in the morning at the garden house of Surendra, one of his 










beloved householder disciples, in the village of Kankurgachi near Calcutta. Surendra had invited 










him and a large number of the devotees to a religious festival. 



















Occasions like this were a source of great happiness and rejoicing to the Master's devotees. 










He was then seen at his best. He joined with the others in devotional music and in chanting the 










names of God, frequently going into ecstasy. He poured out his entire soul in inspired talk, 










explaining the various phases of God-Consciousness. The impressions of such a festival lingered in 










the minds of all for many days. 



















The devotees stood in rows inside the big hall of the garden house to hear the music sung 










by the professional singers. The floor of the room was covered with a carpet over which was 










spread a white sheet; a few bolsters, pillows, and cushions lay here and there. 



















KRISHNA AND GOPIS AT VRINDAVAN 



















The musicians were singing of the episodes in the life of Sri Krishna especially associated 










with His divine love for the gopis of Vrindavan. This was a theme which always appealed to the 










Master and would throw him into ecstatic moods. 



















Krishna, God Incarnate, lived the years of His boyhood in Vrindavan as a cowherd. He 










tended His cows on the green meadows along the bank of the Jamuna and played His flute. The 










milkmaids could not resist the force of His divine attraction. At the sound of His flute they would 










leave their household duties and go to the bank of the sacred river. Their love for Krishna 










destroyed their attachment to worldly things. Neither the threats of their relatives nor the 










criticism of others could make them desist from seeking the company of Krishna. In the love of the 










gopis for Krishna there was not the slightest trace of worldliness. It was the innate attraction of 










God for pure souls, as of the magnet for iron. The author of the Bhagavata has compared this love 










to the all-consuming love of a woman for her beloved. Before the on rush of that love all barriers 





































between man and God are swept away. The devotee surrenders himself completely to his Divine 










Beloved and in the end becomes one with Him. 



















Radha was the foremost of the gopis, and Krishna's chief playmate. She felt an indescribable 










longing for union with Him. A moment's separation from Krishna would rend her heart and soul. 



















During many a moonlit night Krishna would dance with Radha and the gopis in the sacred 










groves of Vrindavan, and on such occasions the gopis would experience the highest religious 










ecstasy. At the age of eleven Krishna was called to be the king of 



















Mathura. He left the gopis, promising them, however, His divine vision whenever they 










concentrated on Him in their hearts. 



















For centuries and centuries the lovers of God in India have been worshipping the Divine by 










recreating in themselves the yearning of the gopis for Krishna. Many of the folk-songs of India have 










as their theme this sweet episode of Krishna's life. Sri Chaitanya revived this phase of Hindu 










religious life by his spiritual practice and his divine visions. In his ecstatic music Chaitanya assumed 










the role of Radha and manifested the longing to be united with Krishna. For a long period Sri 










Ramakrishna also worshipped God as his beloved Krishna, looking on himself as one of the gopis or 










as God's handmaid. 



















At Surendra's garden house the kirtan had begun early in the morning. The musicians were 










singing about the love of Krishna and Radha for each other. The Master was frequently in samadhi. 










The room was crowded with devotees, among them Bhavanath, Niranjan, Rakhal , Surendra, Ram, 










and M., and many members of the Brahmo Samaj. 



















In accordance with the custom, the kirtan had begun with, an introductory song about 










Gauranga. 



















Gauranga embraces monastic life. He is being consumed with longing for a vision of Krishna. 










He leaves Navadvip and goes away as a wandering monk to seek out his Beloved. His devotees, 










unable to bear the pangs of separation, weep bitterly and beg Gauranga to return. 



















The musician sang: 



















Gaur, come back to Nadia! 



















MASTER'S ECSTASY 



















Next the musician sang about the anguish of Radha at her separation from Krishna. When 










Sri Ramakrishna heard the song he suddenly stood up. Assuming the mood of Radha, he sang in a 










voice laden with sorrow, improvising the words: "0 friend, either bring my beloved Krishna here or 










take me to Him." Thus singing, he completely lost himself in Radha and could not continue the 










song. He became speechless, his body motionless, his eyes half closed, his mind totally 










unconscious of the outer world. He was in deep samadhi. 





































RADHA'S ANGUISH AT SEPARATION FROM KRISHNA 



















After a long time he regained normal consciousness and said in the same heart-rending 










voice: "0 friend, take me to my beloved Krishna and make me your bondslave. I shall be your 










handmaid for ever. friend, it was you who taught me how to love Krishna. Krishna! Beloved 










of my soul!" 



















The professional musicians continued their song. They took the part of Radha and sang as if 










she were talking to her friend: "0 friend, I shall not go again to the Jamuna to draw water. Once I 










beheld my beloved Friend under the kadamba tree. Whenever I pass it I am overwhelmed." 



















The Master again became abstracted. Heaving a deep sigh he said, "Ah me! Ah me!" 



















The song went on. Radha says: 



















Even the desire for Krishna's presence Has cooled and refreshed my feverish body. 



















Now and then, the musicians improvised lines to the music, continuing in the attitude of 



















Radha: 



















"0 friends, you can wait. Show me Krishna, my Beloved." 



















Again: "Do not bother about my ornaments. I have lost my most precious Ornament." 



















And again: "Alas! I have fallen on evil days. My happy days are over." And finally: "This 










unhappy time lingers so long!" 



















Sri Ramakrishna improvised a line himself: "Are not better times yet in sight for me?" The 










musicians then improvised: "Such a long time has passed! Are not better times yet in sight for 










me?" 



















The musicians sang Radha's words to a friend: 



















friend, I am dying! Surely I die. The anguish of being kept apart From Krishna is more than 










I can bear. Alas! To whom then shall I leave. My priceless Treasure? When I am dead, I beg you, do 










not burn my body; do not cast it into the river. See that it is not given to the flames; Do not cast it 










into the water. In this body I played with Krishna. Bind my lifeless form, I beg you, To the black 










tamala's branches; Tie it to the tamala tree. Touching tamala it touches black. Krishna is black, and 










black is tamala; Black is the colour that I love. From earliest childhood I have loved it. To the black 










Krishna my body belongs; Let it not lie apart from black! 



















Radha reaches her last extremity. She faints away. 



















Radha has fallen to the ground; She lies there lost to outward sense, Repeating her precious 










Krishna's name, And straightway doses both her eyes. Ah, has the drama reached its end? 



















What ails you, delight of Krishna? Only a moment ago you spoke. Her friends, anointing 










Radha's form with cool and soothing sandal-paste, Attempt to bring her back to earth. Some of 










them weep in bitter grief; they cannot bear to see her die. Some sprinkle water on her face; 










perhaps she will revive again! But, oh, can water give back life to one who dies of Krishna's love? 





































Radha's friends chant Krishna's sweet name in her ears. This brings her back to partial 










consciousness. She looks at the black tamala tree and thinks that Krishna stands before her. 



















Krishna's name restores her life; Once more her two eyes gaze around, But Krishna's face 










she cannot see. Alas, how bitterly she weeps! "Where is my Krishna? Where is He whose name you 










chanted in my ears? Bring Him but once before me here!" Seeing the black tamala tree, She stares 










at it and cries aloud: "There is His crest! I see it clearly! There is my "Krishna's lovely crest!" But 










only a peacock did she see, whose glistening feathers she mistook for the gay feather on Krishna's 










crest. 



















Krishna has gone to Mathura to assume His royal duties. He has discarded His cowherd's 










dress and flute and put on the royal regalia. Radha's friends, after a hurried consultation, send a 










gopi to Mathura as messenger. She meets a woman of that city, of her own age, who asks her 










where she comes from. 



















Radha's friend says: "I don't have to call Krishna. He Himself will come to me." But none the 










less, she follows the woman of Mathura and goes to Krishna's palace. In the street she weeps 










overcome with grief, and prays to Krishna: "0 Hari, where are You? Life of the gopis! 










Enchanter of our hearts! Beloved of Radha! Hari, Remover of Your devotees' shame! Come to 










us once more! With great pride I said to the people of Mathura that You Yourself would come to 










me. Please do not humiliate me." 



















In scorn says the woman of Mathura: 



















"Oh, you are only a simple milkmaid! How can you go to see our King, Our Krishna, in your 










beggar's rags? Behind seven doors His chamber stands. You cannot enter. How can you go? I die of 










shame to see your boldness. Tell me, how will you manage to enter?" 



















Says the gopi: 



















"Krishna! Beloved! Soul of the gopis! Oh, where are You? Come to me here and save my life. 










Where are You, adorable Soul of the gopis? Come to me, Lord of Mathura! And save the life of 










Your sorrowing handmaid. Ah, where are You, Beloved of Radha? Lord of our hearts and Friend of 










our souls! Hari, Destroyer of our shame! priceless Treasure of the gopis! Come to Your 










handmaid and save her honour." 



















Thus the messenger weeps and cries out for Krishna. 



















When the musicians sang, "Where are You, adorable Soul of the gopis?" the Master went 










into samadhi. As the music neared its end the musicians sang louder. Sri Ramakrishna was on his 










feet, again in deep samadhi. Regaining partial consciousness, he said in a half articulate voice, 










"Kitna! Kitna!" He was too much overwhelmed to utter Krishna's name distinctly. 



















The kirtan was coming to a close. At the reunion of Radha and Krishna the Master sang with 










the musicians, composing the lines himself: 



















Behold, there Radha stands by Krishna; On His bosom she reclines. Behold her standing at 










His left, Like a golden creeper twining Round a black tamala tree! 





































As the music came to a close the Master led the chorus. All chanted together, to the 










accompaniment of drums and cymbals: "Victory to Radha and Krishna! Hallowed be the names of 










Radha and Krishna!" The devotees felt a surge of divine emotion and danced around the Master. 










He too danced in an ecstasy of joy. The names of God echoed and reechoed in the house and 










garden. 



















MASTER'S PRAISE OF NIRANJAN 



















After the music the Master sat with the devotees. Just then Niranjan arrived and prostrated 










himself before him. At the very sight of this beloved disciple the Master stood up; with beaming 










eyes and smiling face, and said: "You have come too! (To M.) You see, this boy is absolutely 










guileless. One cannot be guileless without a great deal of spiritual discipline in previous births. A 










hypocritical and calculating mind can never attain God. 



















"Don't you see that God incarnates Himself only in a family where innocence exists? How 










guileless Dasaratha was! So was Nanda, Krishna's father. There is a saying: 'Ah, how innocent a 










man he is! 



















He is just like Nanda.' 



















(To Niranjan) "I feel as if a dark veil has covered your face. It is because you have accepted a 










job in an office. One must keep accounts there. Besides, one must attend to many other things, 










and that always keeps the mind in a state of worry. You are serving in an office like other worldly 










people; but there is a slight difference, in that you are earning money for the sake of your mother. 










One must show the highest respect to one's mother, for she is the very embodiment of the Blissful 










Mother of the Universe. If you had accepted the job for the sake of wife and children, I should 










have said: 'Fie upon you! Shame! A thousand shames!' 



















(To Mani Mallick, pointing to Niranjan) "Look at this boy. He is absolutely guileless. But he 










has one fault: he is slightly untruthful nowadays. The other day he said that he would visit me 










again very soon, but he didn't come. (To Niranjan) That is why Rakhal asked you why you didn't 










come to see me while you were at Ariadaha, so near Dakshineswar." 



















NIRANJAN: "I was there only a couple of days." 



















MASTER (to Niranjan, pointing to M.) "He is the headmaster of a school. At my bidding he 










went to see you. (To M.) Did you send Baburam to me the other day?" 



















The Master went to an adjoining room and began to talk with some devotees there. 



















BE MAD FOR GOD ALONE 



















MASTER (to M.): "Ah! How wonderful was the yearning of the gopis for Krishna! They were 










seized with divine madness at the very sight of the black tamala tree. Separation from Krishna 










created such a fire of anguish in Radha's heart that it dried up even the tears in her eyes! Her tears 










would disappear in steam. There were other times when nobody could notice the depth of her 










feeling. People do not notice the plunge of an elephant in a big lake." 





































M: "Yes, sir, that is true. Chaitanya, too, experienced a similar feeling. He mistook a forest 










for the sacred grove of Vrindavan, and the dark water of the ocean for the blue Jamuna" 



















MASTER: "Ah! If anyone has but a particle of such prema! What yearning! What love! Radha 










possessed not only one hundred per cent of divine love, but one hundred and twenty-five per 










cent. 



















This is what it means to be intoxicated with ecstatic love of God. The sum and substance of 










the whole matter is that a man must love God, must be restless for Him. It doesn't matter whether 










you believe in God with form or in God without form. You may or may not believe that God 










incarnates Himself as man. But you will realize Him if you have that yearning. Then He Himself will 










let you know what He is like. If you must be mad, why should you be mad for the things of the 










world? If you must be mad, be mad for God alone." 



















Presently Sri Ramakrishna returned to the main hall of the house. A big pillow was placed 










near him for his use. Before touching it he said, "Om Tat Sat" Perhaps the pillow had been used by 










many worldly people, and that was why he purified it in this way. Bhavanath, M., and other 










devotees sat near him. It was getting late, but there was no indication that the meal was going to 










be served. The Master became impatient, like a child, and said: "I don't see any sign of food. 



















What's the matter? Where is Narendra?" 



















A DEVOTEE (with a smile): "Sir, Ram Babu is the manager of the feast. He is superintending 










everything." 



















MASTER (laughing): "Oh, Ram is the manager! Then we know what to expect." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Things like this always happen when he is the supervisor." (All laugh.) 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Where is Surendra? What a nice disposition he has now! He is 










very outspoken; he isn't afraid to speak the truth. He is unstinting in his liberality. No one that goes 










to him for help comes away empty-handed. (To M.) You went to Bhagavan Das. What sort of man 










is he?" 



















M: "He is very old now. I saw him at Kalna. It was night. He lay on a carpet and a devotee 










fed him with food that had been offered to God. He can hear only if one speaks loudly into his ear. 



















Hearing me mention your name he said, 'You have nothing to worry about.'" 



















BHAVANATH (to M.): "You haven't been to Dakshineswar for a long time. The Master asked 










me about you and said one day, 'Has M. lost all taste for this place?' " 



















Bhavanath laughed as he said these words. The Master heard their conversation and said to 










M. in a loving voice: "Yes, that is true. Why haven't you been to Dakshineswar for such a long 










time?" 



















M. could only stammer some lame excuses. 



















Just then Mahimacharan arrived. He lived at Cossipore near Calcutta. Mahimacharan held 










the Master in great respect and was a frequent visitor at the temple garden. He was a man of 





































independent means, having inherited some ancestral property. He devoted his time to religious 










thought and to the study of the scriptures. He was a man of some scholarship, having studied 










many books, both Sanskrit and English. 



















MASTER (to Mahima): "What is this? I see a steamship here. (All laugh.) We expect here a 










small boat at the most, but a real steamship has arrived. But then I know. It's the rainy season!" 










(Laughter.) 



















The Master was conversing with Mahimacharan. He asked him: "Isn't feeding people a kind 










of service to God? God exists in all beings as fire. To feed people is to offer oblations to that 










Indwelling Spirit. But then one shouldn't feed the wicked, I mean people who are entangled in 










gross worldliness or who have committed heinous crimes like adultery. Even the ground where 










such people sit becomes impure to a depth of seven cubits. Once Hriday fed a number of people at 










his native place. A good many of them were wicked. I said to Hriday: 'Look here. If you feed such 










people I shall leave your house at once.' (To Mahima) I hear that you used to feed people; but now 










you don't give any such feasts. Is it because your expenses have gone up?" (Laughter.) 



















The meal was to be served on the south verandah of the house. Leaf-plates were being 










placed on the floor. The Master said to Mahimacharan: "Please go there and see what they are 










doing. You may help them a little in serving the food. But I shouldn't ask you." Mahimacharan said: 










"Let them bring in the food. I shall see." Hemming and hawing, he went toward the kitchen, but 










presently he came back. 



















Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees enjoyed the meal greatly. Afterwards he rested awhile. 










About two o'clock in the afternoon Pratap Chandra Mazumdar of the Brahmo Samaj arrived. He 










was a co-worker of Keshab Chandra Sen and had been to Europe and America in connection with 










the Brahmo missionary work. He greeted Sri Ramakrishna, and the Master, too, bowed before him 










with his usual modesty. 



















They were soon engaged in conversation. 



















PRATAP: "I have been to Darjeeling recently for a change of air." 



















MASTER: "But your health hasn't much improved. What are you suffering from?" 



















PRATAP: "The same-illness that Keshab died of." 



















They began to talk about Keshab. Pratap said: "Even in boyhood he showed non-attachment 










to worldly things, seldom making merry with other boys. He was a student in the Hindu College. At 










that time he became friendly with Satyendra and through him made the acquaintance of his 










father, Devendranath Tagore. Keshab cultivated bhakti and at the same time practised meditation. 










At times he would be so much overcome with divine love that he would become unconscious. The 










main purpose of his life was to introduce religion among householders. 



















The conversation next turned to a certain Marhatta lady. 





































PRATAP: "Some women of our country have been to England. This Marhatta lady, who is 










very scholarly, also visited England. Later she embraced Christianity. Have you heard her name, 










sir?" 



















EGOTISM BRINGS CALAMITY 



















MASTER: "No. But from what you say it seems to me that she has a desire for name and 










fame. That kind of egotism is not good. The feeling 'I am the doer' is the outcome of ignorance. But 










the feeling that God does everything is due to knowledge. God alone is the Doer; all others are 










mere instruments in His hands. 



















PARABLE OF THE CALF 



















"The misfortune that befalls a man on account of his egotism can be realized if you only 










think of the condition of the calf. The calf says, 'Hamma! Hamma!' that is, 'I! I!' And just look at its 










misfortune! At times it is yoked to the plough and made to work in the field from sunup to 










sundown, rain or shine. Again, it may be slaughtered by the butcher. In that case the flesh is eaten 










and the skin tanned into hide. From the hide shoes are made. People put on these shoes and walk 










on the rough ground. Still that is not the end of its misfortunes. Drums are made from its skin and 










mercilessly beaten with sticks. At last its entrails are made into strings for the bow used in carding 










cotton. When used by the carder the string gives the sound 'Tuhu! Tuhu!','Thou! Thou!'-that is, 'It 










is Thou, Lord! It is Thou!' It no longer says, 'Hamma! Hamma!', 'I! I!' Only then does the calf's 










trouble come to an end, and it is liberated. It doesn't return to the world of action. 



















"Likewise, when the embodied soul says: '0 God, I am not the doer; Thou art the Doer. I am 










the machine and Thou art its Operator', only then does its suffering of worldly life come to an end; 










only then does it obtain liberation. It no longer has to be reborn in this world of action." 



















A DEVOTEE: "How can a man get rid of his ego?" 



















MASTER: "You cannot get rid of it until you have realized God. If you find a person free from 










ego, then know for certain that he has seen God." 



















SIGNS OF GOD-VISION 



















DEVOTEE: "What, sir, are the signs of God-vision?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, there are such signs. It is said in the Bhagavata that a man who has seen God 










behaves sometimes like a child, sometimes like a ghoul, sometimes like an inert thing, and 










sometimes like a madman. 



















"The man who has seen God becomes like a child. He is beyond the three gunas; he is 










unattached to any of them. He behaves like a ghoul, for he maintains the same attitude toward 










things holy and unholy. Again, like a madman, he sometimes laughs and sometimes weeps. Now 










he dresses himself like a dandy and the next moment he goes entirely naked and roams about with 










his cloth under his arm. Therefore he seems to be a lunatic. Again, at times he sits motionless like 










an inert thing." 





































HARMLESS EGO 



















DEVOTEE: "Does the ego disappear altogether after the realization of God?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, sometimes God totally effaces the ego of His devotee, as in the state of 










samadhi. 



















But in many cases He keeps a trace of ego. But that doesn't injure anybody. It is like the ego 










of a child. A five-year-old child no doubt says T, but that ego doesn't harm anybody. At the touch 










of the philosopher's stone, steel is turned into gold; the steel sword becomes a sword of gold. 



















The gold sword has the form of a sword, no doubt, but it cannot injure anybody. One 










cannot cut anything with a gold sword. 



















(To Pratap) "You have been to England. Tell us what you saw there." 



















PRATAP: "The English people worship what you call 'gold'. Of course, there are also some 










good people in England, those who live an unattached life. But generally one finds there a great 










display of rajas in everything. I saw the same thing in America." 



















SECRET OF WORK 



















MASTER (to Pratap): "It is not in England alone that one sees attachment to worldly things. 










You see it everywhere. But remember that work is only the first step in spiritual life. God cannot be 










realized without sattva-love, discrimination, kindness, and so on. It is the very nature of rajas to 










involve a man in many worldly activities. That is why rajas degenerates into tamas. If a man is 










entangled in too many activities he surely forgets God. He becomes more and more attached to 










'woman and gold'. 



















"But it is not possible for you to give up work altogether. Your very nature will lead you to it 










whether you like it or not. Therefore the scriptures ask you to work in a detached spirit, that is to 










say, not to crave the work's results. For example, you may perform devotions and worship, and 










practise austerities, but your aim is not to earn people's recognition or to increase your merit. 



















"To work in such a spirit of detachment is known as karmayoga. But it is very difficult. We 










are living in the Kaliyuga, when one easily becomes attached to one's actions. You may think you 










are working in a detached spirit, but attachment creeps into the mind from nobody knows where. 










You may worship in the temple or arrange a grand religious festival or feed many poor and starving 










people. You may think you have done all this without hankering after the results. But unknown to 










yourself the desire for name and fame has somehow crept into your mind. Complete detachment 










from the results of action is possible only for one who has seen God." 



















THE PATH OF BHAKTI FOR THIS AGE 



















A DEVOTEE: "Then what is the way for those who have not seen God? Must they give up all 










the duties of the world?" 



















MASTER: "The best path for this age is bhaktiyoga, the path of bhakti prescribed by Narada: 










to sing the name and glories of God and pray to Him with a longing heart, '0 God, give me 





































knowledge, give me devotion, and reveal Thyself to me!' The path of karma is extremely difficult. 










Therefore one should pray: '0 God, make my duties fewer and fewer; and may I, through Thy 










grace, do the few duties that Thou givest me without any attachment to their results! May I have 










no desire to be involved in many activities!' 



















"It is not possible to give up work altogether. Even to think or to meditate is a kind of work. 



















As you develop love for God, your worldly activities become fewer and fewer of themselves. 










And you lose all interest in them. Can one who has tasted a drink made of sugar candy enjoy a 










drink made of ordinary molasses?" 



















FIRST GOD AND THEN WORLDLY DUTIES 



















A DEVOTEE: "The English people always exhort us to be active. Isn't action the aim of life 



















then?" 



















MASTER: "The aim of life is the attainment of God. Work is only a preliminary step; it can 










never be the end. Even unselfish work is only a means; it is not the end. 



















"Sambhu Mallick once said to me, 'Please bless me, sir, that I may spend all my money for 










good purposes, such as building hospitals and dispensaries; making roads, and digging wells.' I said 










to him: 'It will be good if you can do these things in a spirit of detachment. But that is very difficult. 










Whatever you may do, you must always remember that the aim of this life of yours is the 










attainment of God and not the building of hospitals and dispensaries. Suppose God appeared 










before you and said to you, "Accept a boon from Me." Would you then ask Him, "0 God, build me 










some hospitals and dispensaries"? Or would you not rather pray to Him: "0 God, may I have pure 










love at Your Lotus Feet! May I have Your uninterrupted vision!"? Hospitals, dispensaries, and all 










such things are unreal. God alone is real and all else unreal. Furthermore, after realizing God one 










feels that He alone is the Doer and we are but His instruments. Then why should we forget Him 










and destroy ourselves by being involved in too many activities? After realizing Him, one may, 










through His grace, become His instrument in building many hospitals and dispensaries.' 



















"Therefore I say again that work is only the first step. It can never be the goal of life. Devote 










yourself to spiritual practice and go forward. Through practice you will advance more and more in 










the path of God. At last you will come to know that God alone is real and all else is illusory, and 










that the goal of life is the attainment of God. 



















THE STORY OF THE WOOD-CUTTER 



















"Once upon a time a wood-cutter went into a forest to chop wood. There suddenly he met 










a brahmachari. The holy man said to him, 'My good man, go forward.' On returning home the 










wood-cutter asked himself, 'Why did the brahmachari tell me to go forward?' Some time passed. 










One day he remembered the brahmachari's words. He said to himself, 'Today I shall go deeper into 










the forest.' Going deep into the forest, he discovered innumerable sandal-wood trees. He was very 










happy and returned with cart-loads of sandal-wood. He sold them in the market and became very 










rich. 





































"A few days later he again remembered the words of the holy man to go forward. He went 










deeper into the forest and discovered a silver-mine near a river. This was even beyond his dreams. 










He dug out silver from the mine and sold it in the market. He got so much money that he didn't 










even know how much he had. 



















"A few more days passed. One day he thought: 'The brahmachari didn't ask me to stop at 










the silver-mine; he told me to go forward.' This time he went to the other side of the river and 










found a gold-mine. Then he exclaimed: 'Ah, just see! This is why he asked me to go forward.' 



















"Again, a few days afterwards, he went still deeper into the forest and found heaps of 










diamonds and other precious gems. He took these also and became as rich as the god of wealth 










himself. 



















GO FORWARD 



















"Therefore I say that, whatever you may do, you will find better and better things if only 










you go forward. You may feel a little ecstasy as the result of japa, but don't conclude from this that 










you have achieved everything in spiritual life. Work is by no means the goal of life. Go forward, and 










then you will be able to perform unselfish work. But again I say that it is most difficult to perform 










unselfish work. Therefore with love and longing in your heart pray to God: '0 God, grant me 










devotion at Thy Lotus Feet and reduce my worldly duties. Please grant me the boon that the few 










duties I must do may be done in a detached spirit.' If you go still farther you will realize God. 



















You will see Him. In time you will converse with Him." 



















Next the conversation turned to the quarrels among the members of the Brahmo Samaj. 










They had had a misunderstanding about the right to preach in the temple after Keshab's death. 



















MASTER (to Pratap): "I hear that some members of the Samaj have quarrelled with you 










about the altar. But they are most insignificant persons-mere nobodies. 



















(To the devotees): "People like Pratap and Amrita are like good conchshells, which give out 










a loud sound. And the rest, about whom you hear so much, don't give out any sound at all." (All 










laugh.) 



















PRATAP: "Speaking of sounds, even such a worthless thing as a mangostone makes a 










sound!" 



















MASTER (to Pratap): "One can very well understand the inner feeling of a teacher of your 










Brahmo Samaj by hearing his preaching. Once I went to a meeting of a Hari Sabha. The preacher of 










the day was a pundit named Samadhyayi. And can you imagine what he said? He said in the course 










of his sermon: 'God is dry. We must make Him sweet and fresh with our love and devotion.' I was 










stunned to hear these words. Then I was reminded of a story. A boy once said: 'At my uncle's 










house there are many horses. Oh, yes! His whole cow-shed is full of them.' Now if it was really a 










cow-shed, then horses could not be kept there. Possibly he had only cows. What did people think 










on hearing such an incoherent statement? They believed that there were surely no such animals as 










horses in the shed." (Laughter.) 





































A DEVOTEE: "True, sir, there were not only no horses, but possibly there were also no 










cows!" (Laughter.) 



















MASTER: "Just fancy, to describe God, who is of the very nature of Love and Bliss, as dry! It 










only proves that the man has never experienced what God is like. 



















MASTER'S ADVICE TO PRATAP 



















(To Pratap) "Let me tell you something. You are a learned and intelligent and 










serious-minded soul. Keshab and you were like the two brothers, Gaur and Nitai. You have had 










enough of lectures, arguments, quarrels,discussions, and dissensions. Can such things interest you 










any more? Now gather your whole mind and direct it to God. Plunge deep into God." 



















PRATAP: "Yes, sir, you are right. That is surely my only duty now. But I am doing all these 










things only to perpetuate Keshab's name." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "No doubt you say now that you are doing all this to keep his name 










alive; but in a few days you won't feel that way. Listen to a story. A man had built a house on a hill. 



















It was only a mud hut, but he had built it with great labour. A few days after, there came a 










violent storm and the hut began to rock. The man became very anxious to save it and prayed to 










the god of the winds,'0 god of the winds, please don't wreck the house!' But the god of the winds 










paid no heed to his prayer. The house was about to crash. Then he thought of a trick. He 










remembered that Hanuman was the son of the god of the winds. At once he cried out with great 










earnestness: '0 revered sir, please don't pull down the house. It belongs to Hanuman. I beseech 










you to protect it.' But still the house continued to shake violently. Nobody seemed to listen to his 










prayer. He repeated many times, 'Oh, this house belongs to Hanuman!' But the fury of the wind 










did not abate. Then he remembered that Hanuman was the devoted servant of Rama, whose 










younger brother was Lakshmana. Desperately the man prayed, crying aloud, 'Oh, this house 










belongs to Lakshmana!' But that also failed to help matters. So the man cried out as a last resort: 










'This is Rama's house. Don't break it down, god of the winds! I beseech you most humbly.' But 










this too proved futile, and the house began to crash down. Whereupon the man, who now had to 










save his own life, rushed out of it with the curse: 'Let it go! This is the devil's own hut!' 



















(To Pratap): "You don't have to perpetuate Keshab's name. Remember that he achieved all 










his success through the will of God. Through the divine will his work was established, and through 










the divine will it is disintegrating. What can you do about it? Now it is your bounden duty to give 










your entire mind to God, to plunge deep into the Ocean of His Love." 



















Saying these words the Master sang in his sweet voice: 



















Dive deep, mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God's Beauty; if you descend to the uttermost 










depths, There you will find the gem of Love. 



















Go seek, mind, go seek Vrindavan in your heart, where with His loving devotees Sri 










Krishna sports eternally. 





































Light up, mind, light up true wisdom's shining lamp, and let it burn with steady flame 










unceasingly within your heart. 



















Who is it that steers your boat across the solid earth? It is your guru, says Kubir; Meditate 










on his holy feet. 



















The Master continued, addressing Pratap: "Did you listen to the song? You have had enough 










of lectures and quarrels. Now dive deep into the Ocean of God. There is no fear of death from 










plunging into this Ocean, for this is the Ocean of Immortality. Don't think that this will make you 










lose your head. Never for a moment harbour the idea that by thinking too much of God one 










becomes insane. Once I said to Narendra" 



















PRATAP: "Who is Narendra, sir?" 



















MASTER: "Oh, never mind. There is a young man of that name. I said to Narendra: 'Look 










here, my boy. God is the Ocean of Bliss; don't you want to plunge into this Ocean? Suppose there 










is a cup of syrup and you are a fly. Where will you sit to sip the syrup?' Narendra said, 'I will sit on 










the edge of the cup and stick my head out to drink it.' 'Why?' said I. 'Why should you sit on the 










edge?' He replied, 'If I go far into the syrup, I shall be drowned and lose my life.' Then I said to him: 










'But, my child, there is no such fear in the Ocean of Satchidananda. It is the Ocean of Immortality. 










By plunging into it a man does not die; he becomes immortal. Man does not lose his consciousness 










by being mad about God. 



















KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE 



















(To the devotees) "The feeling of 'I ' and 'mine' is ignorance. People say that Rani Rasmani 










built the Kali temple; but nobody says it was the work of God. They say that such and such a 










person established the Brahmo Samaj; but nobody says it was founded through the will of God. 










This feeling, 'I am the doer', is ignorance. On the contrary, the idea, '0 God, Thou art the Doer and 










I am only an instrument; Thou art the Operator and I am the machine', is Knowledge. After 










attaining Knowledge a man says: '0 God, nothing belongs to me-neither this house of worship nor 










this Kali temple nor this Brahmo Samaj. These are all Thine. Wife, son, and family do not belong to 










me. They are all Thine.' 



















"To love these objects, regarding them as one's own, is maya. But to love all things is daya, 










compassion. To love only the members of the Brahmo Samaj or of one's own family is maya; to 










love one's own countrymen is maya. But to love the people of all countries, to love the members 










of all religions, is daya. Such love comes from love of God, from daya. 



















"Maya entangles a man and turns him away from God. But through daya one realizes God. 










Sages like Sukadeva and Narada always cherished daya in their hearts." 



















PRATAP: "Revered sir, are those who live with you making progress in spiritual life?" 



















MASTER: "I tell people that there is nothing wrong in the life of the world. But they must 










live in the world as a maidservant lives in her master's house.' 





































Referring to her master's house, she says, 'That is our house.' But her real home is perhaps 










in a far-away village. Pointing out her master's house to others, she says, no doubt, 'This is our 










house', but in her heart she knows very well that it doesn't belong to her and that her own house 










is in a faraway village. She brings up her master's son and says, 'My Hari has grown very naughty', 










or 'My Hari doesn't like sweets.' Though she repeats, 'My Hari' with her lips, yet she knows in her 










heart that Hari doesn't belong to her, that he is her master's son. 



















"Thus I say to those who visit me: 'Why don't you live in the world? There is no harm in that. 



















But always keep your mind, on God. Know for certain that house, family and property are 










not yours. They are God's. Your real home is in God.' Also I ask them to pray always with a longing 










heart for love of God's Lotus Feet." 



















Again the conversation turned to the English people. A devotee said, "Sir, I understand that 










nowadays the pundits of England do not believe in the existence of God." 



















PRATAP: "However they may talk, I don't believe that any of them is a real atheist. Many of 










them have had to admit that there is a great power behind the activities of the universe." 



















MASTER: "Well, that is enough. They believe in Sakti, don't they? Then why should they be 










atheists?" 



















PRATAP: "They also believe in the moral government of the universe." 










Pratap was now about to take leave of the Master. 



















MASTER (to Pratap): "What more shall I say to you? My only request is that you do not 










involve yourself in quarrels and dissensions any more. Another thing. It is 'woman and gold' that 










keeps men away from God. That is the barrier. Don't you find that everyone has nothing but praise 










for his own wife? (All laugh.) A wife may be good or bad; but if you ask her husband about her he 










will always say, 'Oh, she is very good-'" 



















At this point Pratap bade the Master good-bye. He did not wait to hear the end of Sri 










Ramakrishna's words about the renunciation of "woman and gold". Those burning words touched 










the hearts of the devotees and were carried away on the wind through the gently rustling leaves in 










the garden. 



















A few minutes later Mani Mallick said to Sri Ramakrishna: "Sir, it is time for you to leave for 










Dakshineswar. Today Keshab's mother and the other ladies of his family are going to the temple 










garden to visit you. They will be hurt if they do not find you there." 



















Keshab had passed away only a few months before. His old mother and his other relatives 










wanted to visit the Master. 



















MASTER (to Mani Mallick): "Don't hurry me, please. I didn't sleep well. I can't rush. They are 










going to Dakshineswar. What am I to do about it? They will stroll in the garden and enjoy it 










thoroughly." 





































After resting a little the Master was ready to leave for Dakshineswar. He was thinking of 










Surendra's welfare. He visited the different rooms, softly chanting the holy name of God. 



















Suddenly he stood still and said: "I didn't eat any luchi at meal time. Bring me a little now." 



















He ate only a crumb and said: "There is much meaning in my asking for the luchi. If I should 










remember that I hadn't eaten any at Surendra's house, then I should want to come back for it." 



















(All laugh.) 



















MANI MALLICK: "That would have been nice. Then we too should have come with you." 










The devotees laughed. 










Friday, June 20, 1884 



















It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room, absorbed in contemplation of the 










Divine Mother. Now and then he was chanting Her name. Rakhal , Adhar, M., and several other 










devotees were with him. 



















After a while the evening worship began in the temples. Adhar left the room to see the 










worship. 



















Sri Ramakrishna and M. conversed. 



















MASTER: "Tell me, does Baburam intend to continue his studies? I said to him, 'Continue 










your studies to set an example to others.' After Sita had been set free, Bibhishana refused to 










become king of Ceylon. Rama said to him: 'You should become king to open the eyes of the 










ignorant. 



















Otherwise they will ask you what you have gained as a result of serving Me. They will be 










pleased to see you acquire the kingdom.' 



















BABURAM S SPIRITUAL NATURE 



















"I noticed the other day that Baburam, Bhavanath, and Harish have a feminine nature. In a 










vision I saw Baburam as a goddess with a necklace around her neck and with woman companions 










about her. 



















He has received something in a dream. His body is pure. Only a very little effort will awaken 










his spiritual consciousness. 



















CONCERNING RAKHAL 



















"You see, I am having some difficulty about my physical needs. It will be nice if Baburam 










lives with me. The nature of these attendants of mine is undergoing a change. Latu is always tense 










with spiritual emotion. He is about to merge himself in God. Rakhal is getting into such a spiritual 










mood that he can't do anything even for himself. I have to get water for him. He isn't of much 










service to me. 





































"Among the youngsters Baburam and Niranjan are rather exceptional. If other boys come in 










the future, they will, it seems to me, receive instruction and then go away. 



















"But I don't want Baburam to tear himself away from his family. It may make trouble at 



















home. 



















(Smiling) When I ask him, 'Why don't you come?' he says, 'Why not make me come?' He 










looks at Rakhal and weeps. He says, 'Rakhal is very happy here.' 



















"Rakhal now lives here as one of the family. I know that he will never again be attached to 










the world. He says that worldly enjoyments have become tasteless to him. His wife came here on 










her way to Konnagar. She is fourteen. He too was asked to go to Konnagar, but he didn't go. He 










said, 'I don't like merriment and gaiety.' 



















"What do you think of Niranjan?" M: "He is very handsome." 



















NIRANJAN'S GUILELESSNESS 



















MASTER: "No, I am not asking about his looks. He is guileless. One can easily realize God if 










one is free from guile. Spiritual instruction produces quick results in a guileless heart. Such a heart 










is like well cultivated land from which all the stones have been removed. No sooner is the seed 










sown than it germinates. The fruit also appears quickly. 



















"Niranjan will not marry. It is 'woman and gold' that causes entanglement. Isn't that so?" 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "What will one gain by renouncing betel-leaf and tobacco? The real renunciation is 










the renunciation of 'woman and gold.' 



















"I came to know in an ecstatic mood that, though Niranjan had accepted a job in an office, 










he would not be stained by it. He is earning money for his mother. There is no harm in that. 



















"The work you are doing won't injure you either. What you are doing is good. Suppose a 










clerk is sent to jail; he is shut up there and chained, and at last he is released. Does he cut capers 










after his release? Of course not. He works again as a clerk. It is not your intention to accumulate 










money. You only want to support your family. Otherwise, where will they go?" 



















M: "I shall be relieved if someone takes charge of them." 



















MASTER: "That is true. But now do 'this' as well as 'that' " 



















M: "It is great luck to be able to renounce everything." 



















MASTER: "That is true. But people act according to their inherent tendencies. You have a 










few more duties to perform. After these are over you will have peace. Then you will be released. A 










man cannot easily get out of the hospital once his name is registered there. He is discharged only 










when he is completely cured. 





































TWO CLASSES OF MASTER'S DEVOTEES 



















"The devotees who come here may be divided into two groups. One group says, '0 God, 










give me liberation.' Another group, belonging to the inner circle, doesn't talk that way. They are 










satisfied if they can know two things: first, who 16 am; second, who they are and what their 










relationship to me is. You belong to this second group; otherwise. . . 



















"Bhavanath, Baburam, and a few others have a feminine nature. Harish sleeps in a woman's 



















cloth. 



















Baburam says that he too likes the womanly attitude. So I am right. Bhavanath also is like 



















that. 



















But Narendra, Rakhal, and Niranjan have a masculine nature. 



















SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MASTER S INJURING HIS ARM 



















"Please tell me one thing. What is the significance of my having hurt my arm? Once my 










teeth were broken while I was in a state of ecstasy. It is the arm this time." 



















Seeing M. silent, the Master himself continued the conversation. 



















MASTER: "My arm was broken in order to destroy my ego to its very root. Now I cannot find 










my ego within myself any more. When I search for it I see God alone. One can never attain God 










without completely getting rid of the ego. You must have noticed that the chatak bird has its nest 










on the ground but soars up very high. 



















"Captain says I haven't acquired any occult powers because I eat fish. I tremble with fear 










lest I should acquire those powers. If I should have them, then this place would be turned into a 










hospital or a dispensary. People would flock here and ask me to cure their illness. Is it good to have 










occult powers?" 



















M: "No, sir. You have said to us that a man cannot realize God if he possesses even one of 










the eight occult powers." 



















MASTER: "Right you are. Only the small-minded seek them. If one asks something of a rich 










man, one no longer receives any favour from him. The rich man doesn't allow such a person to ride 










in the same carriage with him. Even if he does, he doesn't allow the man to sit near him. Therefore 










love without any selfish motive is best. 



















"God with form and the formless God are both equally true. What do you say? One cannot 










keep one's mind on the formless God a long time. That is why God assumes form for His devotees. 



















"Captain makes a nice remark in this connexion. He says that when a bird gets tired of 










soaring very high it perches on a tree and rests. First is the formless God, and then comes God with 










form. 



















"I shall have to go to your house once. I saw in a vision that the houses of Adhar, Balaram, 










and Surendra were so many places for our forgathering. But it makes no difference to me whether 










they come here or not." 





































M: "That's right. Why shouldn't it be so? One must feel misery if one feels happiness. But 










you are beyond both." 



















MASTER: "Yes. Further, I think of the magician and his magic. The magician alone is real. His 










magic is illusory, like a dream. I realized this when I heard the Chandi recited. Sumbha and 










Nisumbha were scarcely born when I learnt that they both were dead." 



















M: "Yes, sir. Once I was going to Kalna with Gangadhar in a steamer. A country boat struck 










our ship and sank with twenty or twenty-five passengers. They all disappeared in the water, like 










foam churned up by the steamer. 



















"May I ask you one thing? Does a man watching magic really feel compassion when he sees 










suffering in the performance? Does he feel, at that time, any sense of responsibility? One thinks of 










compassion only when one feels responsibility. Isn't that so?" 



















HOW A JNANI LOOKS ON THE ILLUSORY WORLD 



















MASTER: "A Jnani sees everything at once-God, maya, the universe, and living beings. He 










sees that Vidya-maya, Avidya-maya, the universe, and all living beings exist and at the same time 










do not exist. As long as he is conscious of T, he is conscious of 'others' too. Nothing whatsoever 










exists after he cuts through the whole thing with the sword of jnana. Then even his T becomes as 










unreal as the magic of the magician." 



















M. was reflecting on these words, when the Master said: "Do you know what it is like? It is 










as if there were a flower with twenty-five layers of petals, and you cut them all with one stroke. 



















"The idea of responsibility! Goodness gracious! Men like Sankaracharya and Sukadeva kept 










the 'ego of Knowledge'. It is not for man to show compassion, but for God. One feels compassion 










as long as one has the 'ego of Knowledge'. And it is God Himself who has become the 'ego of 










Knowledge'. 



















SUPREME POWER OF ADYASAKTI IN THE RELATIVE WORLD 



















"You may feel a thousand times that it is all magic; but you are still under the control of the 










Divine Mother. You cannot escape Her. You are not free. You must do what She makes you do. A 










man attains Brahmajnana only when it is given to him by the Adyasakti, the Divine Mother. Then 










alone does he see the whole thing as magic; otherwise not. 



















"As long as the slightest trace of ego remains, one lives within the jurisdiction of the 










Adyasakti. One is under Her sway. One cannot go beyond Her. 



















"With the help of the Adyasakti, God sports as an Incarnation. God, through His Sakti, 










incarnates Himself as man. Then alone does it become possible for the Incarnation to carry on His 










work. 



















EVERYTHING IS DUE TO THE SAKTI OF THE DIVINE MOTHER. 



















"When anyone asked the former manager of the temple garden a great favour, the 










manager would say, 'Come after two or three days.' He must ask the proprietor's permission. 





































"God will incarnate Himself as Kalki at the end of the Kaliyuga. He will be born as the son of 










a brahmin. Suddenly and unexpectedly a sword and horse will come to him. . . ." 



















Adhar returned to the Master's room after watching the evening worship in the temples. 



















MASTER (to Adhar and the others): "Bhuvan was here and brought me twenty-five Bombay 










mangoes and some sweets. She said to me, 'Will you eat a mango?' I said, 'My stomach is heavy 










today.' And to tell you the truth, I am feeling uncomfortable after eating a few of the sweets." 



















Bhuvanmohini was a nurse who used to visit Sri Ramakrishna now and then. 



















The Master could not eat the food offerings of everyone, especially of physicians and 










nurses. It was because they accepted money from the sick in spite of the suffering of these people. 



















MASTER: "Keshab Sen's mother, sisters, and other relatives came here; so I had to dance a 



















little. 



















I had to entertain them. What else could I do? They were so grief-stricken!" 



















PUNDIT SHASHADHAR 



















Wednesday, June 25, 1884 



















IT WAS THE DAY of the Rathyatra the Car Festival of the Hindus. At Ishan's invitation Sri 










Ramakrishna went to his house in Calcutta. For some time the Master had had a desire to meet 










Pundit Shashadhar. Tarkachudamani, who had been staying with one of Ishan's neighbours. So it 










was decided that he would visit the pundit in the afternoon. 



















A few devotees, including Hazra, accompanied the Master to Ishan's house. Ishan had 










invited one or two brahmin scholars and a devotee who followed the Tantrik method of worship. 










Shrish and Ishan's other sons were also present. 



















The Master noticed that the Tantrik worshipper had a vermilion mark on his forehead, and 










smilingly said, "I see he is branded." 



















After a while M. and Narendra arrived and bowed before Sri Ramakrishna. The Master had 










previously informed M. that he would be at Ishan's house. 



















The Master joked about the delay in serving their meal. One of the scholars quoted a 










Sanskrit verse about the anxiety created in people's minds by the pangs of hunger. Proceeding to 










explain the verse he said: "The study of philosophy is indeed edifying, but poetry is more 










fascinating than philosophy. People listening to good poems think of the study of 










philosophy-Vedanta, Nyaya, Samkhya, and so forth as dry and insipid. Again, music is more 










attractive than poetry. Music melts even a heart of stone. But a beautiful woman has an even 










greater attraction for a man's heart than music. Such a woman, passing by, diverts a man's 










attention from both poetry and music. But when a man feels the pangs of hunger, everything else 










poetry, music and woman appears as of no consequence. Thus, hunger is the most arresting 










thing." 





































The Master remarked with a smile, "The pundit is witty." 



















Soon Narendra began to sing. A few moments later the Master went upstairs for a little 










rest. M. and Shrish accompanied him. M. introduced Shrish to the Master, saying: "He is a scholar 










and a man of peaceful nature. We were fellow students in our boyhood. Now he is a lawyer." 



















MASTER: "It is a pity that such a man should practise law." 



















M: "Yes, sir. It was a mistake on his part." 



















MASTER: "I know a few lawyers. One of them shows me great respect. He is a 










straightforward man. (To Shrish) What is your idea about the most essential thing in life?" 



















SHRISH: "God exists and He alone does everything. But the attributes we ascribe to Him are 










not the right ones. How can a man canceive of Him? His nature is infinite." 



















MASTER: "What need is there of your counting the number of trees and branches in an 










orchard? You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes. Do that and be happy. The aim of human 










birth is to love God. Realize that love and be at peace. 



















"Suppose you have entered a tavern for a drink. Is it necessary for you to know how many 










gallons of wine there are in the tavern? One glass is enough for you. What need is there of your 










knowing the infinite qualities of God? You may discriminate for millions of years about God's 










attributes and still you will not know them." 



















The Master remained silent a few minutes. A brahmin pundit came into the room. 



















SUFFERINGS IN THE WORLDLY LIFE 



















MASTER (to M.): "There is no substance whatsoever in the worldly life. The members of 










Ishan's family are good; so he has some peace here. Suppose his sons had been lewd, disobedient, 










and addicted to drink and other vices. Then there would have been no end to his troubles. One 










very seldom comes across such a religious family, in which all the members are devoted to God. I 










have seen only two or three such families. Generally one finds quarrels, misunderstanding, 










jealousy, and friction. Besides, there are disease, grief, and poverty in the world. Seeing this 










condition, I prayed to the Divine Mother, '0 Mother, turn my mind at once from the world to God.' 



















"Look at Narendra's troubles. His father is dead and the members of his family are starving. 










He has been trying his utmost to secure a position, but he has not yet found one. Just see how 










unsettled his mind is! 



















(To M.) "You used to come to Dakshineswar very frequently. But why have you become 










such a rare visitor? Perhaps you have become particularly friendly with your wife. Is it true? Why 










should I blame you? The influence of 'woman and gold' is everywhere. Therefore I pray, '0 Divine 










Mother, please don't make me a worldly man if I am to be born again in a human body.' " 



















BRAHMIN SCHOLAR: "Why should you say that, sir? The scriptures extol the life of a 










householder." 





































MASTER: "Yes, that is true. But it is very difficult to lead the true life of a householder. (To 










M.) How wrong of us! They are singing, especially Narendra, and we have left the room." 



















About four o'clock in the afternoon the Master left in a carriage for the house where Pundit 










Shashadhar was staying. As soon as Sri Ramakrishna got into the carriage he went into samadhi. 










His physical frame was very tender as a result of the austerities he had undergone during the long 










years of his spiritual discipline and his constant absorption in God-Consciousness. 



















The Master would suffer from the slightest physical discomfort and even from the vibration 










of worldly thoughts around him. Once Keshab Chandra Sen had said that Sri Ramakrishna, Christ, 










and Sri Chaitanya belonged to a delicate species of humanity that should be kept in a glass case 










and protected from the vulgar contact of the world. 



















It was the rainy season, and a fine drizzle of rain had made the road muddy. The sky was 










overcast. The devotees followed the carriage on foot. As the carriage stopped in front of the 










house, the host and his relatives welcomed the Master and took him upstairs to the 










drawing-room. There the Master met the pundit. 



















PUNDIT SHASHADHAR 



















Pundit Shashadhar, a man of fair complexion and no longer young, had a string of rudraksha 










beads around his neck. He was one of the renowned Sanskrit scholars of his time-a pillar of 










orthodox Hinduism, which had reasserted itself after the first wave of Christianity and Western 










culture had passed over Hindu society. His clear exposition of the Hindu scriptures, his ringing 










sincerity, and, his stirring eloquence had brought back a large number of the educated young 










Hindus of Bengal to the religion of their forefathers. 



















The pundit saluted the Master with reverence. Narendra, Rakhal , Ram, Hazra, and M., who 










had come with the Master, seated themselves in the room as near the Master as they could, 










anxious not to miss one of his words. 



















At the sight of the pundit the Master again went into samadhi. After a while, still remaining 










in that state, he looked at the pundit and said with a smile, "Very well, very well." Then, addressing 










the pundit, the Master said, "Tell me how you give lectures." 



















PUNDIT: "Sir, I try to explain the teachings of the Hindu scriptures." 



















Efficacy of bhakti for modern times MASTER: "For the Kaliyuga the path of devotion 










described by Narada is best. Where can people find time now to perform their duties according to 










the scriptural injunctions? Nowadays the decoctions of roots and herbs of the orthodox Hindu 










physicians cannot be given to a fever patient. By the time that kind of medicine begins its slow 










process of curing, the patient is done for. Therefore only a drastic medicine like the allopathic 










'fever mixture' is effective now. You may ask people to practise scriptural rites and rituals; but, 










when prescribing the rituals, remove the 'head and tail'. I tell people not to bother about the 










elaborate rituals of the sandhya as enjoined in the scriptures. I say that it will be enough for them 










to repeat the Gayatri alone. If you must give instruction about scriptural ceremonies, do so only to 










a very few, like Ishan. 





































FUTILITY OF LECTURING 



















"You may deliver thousands of lectures, but they won't make the slightest impression on 










worldly people. Can one drive a nail into a stone wall? The point of the nail will sooner break than 










make a dent in the stone. What will you gain by striking the tough skin of the crocodile with a 










sword? The sadhu's water-bowl, made from the shell of a bitter gourd, may visit the four principal 










holy places of India with its owner, but it will still remain as bitter as ever. Your lectures are not 










helping worldly people very much; and you will realize this by and by. The calf cannot stand on its 










legs all at once. Now it drops to the ground and now it stands up. So it learns to stand finally on its 










legs and walk. 



















"You cannot distinguish a lover of God from a worldly person. It isn't your fault, of course. 










When the first onrush of the gale shakes the trees, it is impossible to distinguish one tree from 










another-the mango from the tamarind, for instance. 



















RITUALS PREPARE THE WAY FOR DIVINE LOVE 



















"Without having realized God one cannot give up rituals altogether. How long should one 










practise the sandhya and other forms of ritualistic worship? As long as one does not shed tears of 










joy at the name of God and feel a thrill in one's body. You will know that your ritualistic worship 










has come to an end when your eyes become filled with tears as you repeat 'Om Rama'. Then you 










do not have to continue your sandhya or other rituals. 



















"When the fruit appears the blossom drops off. Love of God is the fruit, and rituals are the 










blossom. When the daughter-in-law of the house becomes pregnant, she cannot do much work. 










Her mother-in-law gradually lessens her duties in the house. When her time arrives she does 










practically nothing. And after the child is born her only work is to play with it. She doesn't do any 










household duties at all. The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om, and, Om in 










samadhi. It is like the sound of a bell: t-a-m. The yogi, by following in the trail of the sound Om, 










gradually merges himself in the Supreme Brahman. His sandhya and other ritualistic duties 










disappear in samadhi. Thus the duties of the Jnani come to an end." 



















As the Master talked of samadhi, he himself went into that state. His face radiated a 










heavenly light. Bereft of outer consciousness, he could not utter another word. His gaze was 










indrawn and transfixed in communion with the Self. After a long time the Master began to 










recognize the world around him and said, like a child, "I shall have a drink of water." Whenever 










after samadhi the Master asked for a drink of water, his devotees knew that he was gradually 










becoming conscious of the outer world. 



















Still lingering in the state of ecstasy, he said to the Divine Mother: "0 Mother, the other day 










You showed me Pundit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar. Then I told You that I should like to see another 










pundit, and so You have brought me here." 



















Looking at the pundit, he said: "My child, add a little more to your strength. Practise 










spiritual discipline a few days more. You have hardly set your foot on the tree, yet you expect to 










lay hold of a big cluster of fruit. But, of course, you are doing all this for the welfare of others." 










With these words he bowed his head before the pundit. 





































The Master continued: "When I first heard about you, I inquired whether you were merely 










erudite or whether you had discrimination and renunciation. A pundit who doesn't know how to 










discriminate between the Real and the unreal is no pundit at all. 



















PREACHER WITH GOD'S COMMISSION 



















"There is no harm in teaching others if the preacher has a commission from the Lord. 










Nobody can confound a preacher who teaches people after having received the command of God. 










Getting a ray of light from the goddess of learning, a man becomes so powerful that before him big 










scholars seem mere earthworms. 



















"When the lamp is lighted the moths come in swarms. They don't have to be invited. In the 










same way, the preacher who has a commission from God need not invite people to hear him. He 










doesn't have to announce the time of his lectures. He possesses such irresistible attraction that 










people come to him of their own accord. People of all classes, even kings and aristocrats, gather 










around him. They say to him: 'Revered sir, what can we offer you? Here are mangoes, sweets, 










money, shawls, and other things. What will you be pleased to accept?' In that case I say to them: 










'Go away. I don't care, for these. I don't want anything.' 



















"Does the magnet say to the iron, 'Come near me?' That is not necessary. Because of the 










attraction of the magnet, the iron rushes to it. 



















DIVINE WISDOM IS INEXHAUSTIBLE 



















"Such a preacher may not be a scholarly person, but don't conclude from that that he has 










any lack of wisdom. Does book-learning make one wise? He who has a commission from God 










never runs short of wisdom. That wisdom comes from God; it is inexhaustible. At Kamarpukur I 










have seen people measuring grain. It lies in a heap. One man keeps pushing grain from the heap 










toward another man, who weighs it on a scales. So the man who weighs doesn't run short of grain. 










It is the same with the preacher who has received a commission from God. As he teaches people, 










the Divine Mother Herself supplies him with fresh knowledge from behind. That knowledge never 










comes to an end. 



















"Can a preacher ever lack knowledge if but once he is favoured with a benign glance from 










the Divine Mother? Therefore I ask you whether you have received any commission from God." 



















HAZRA: "Oh yes, he must have it. (To the pundit) Isn't it true, sir?" 



















PUNDIT: "Commission? No, sir, I am afraid I haven't received any such thing." 



















HOST: "He may not have received the commission, but he preaches from a sense of duty." 



















MASTER: "What will a man accomplish by mere lectures without the commission from God? 










Once a Brahmo preacher said in the course of his sermon, 'Friends, how much I used to drink!' and 










so on. Hearing this the people began to whisper among themselves: 'What is this fool saying? He 










used to drink!' Now these words produced a very unfavourable effect. This shows that preaching 










cannot bring a good result unless it comes from a good man. 





































"A high government official from Barisal once said to me, 'Sir, if you begin the work of 










preaching, I too shall gird my loins.' I told him the story of people's dirtying the bank of the 










Haldarpukur and of its being stopped only when a constable, armed with authority from the 










government, put up a notice prohibiting it. 



















"So I say, a worthless man may talk his head off preaching, and yet he will produce no 










effect. But people will listen to him if he is armed with a badge of authority from God. One cannot 










teach others without the commission from God. A teacher of men must have great power. 










There's many a Hanumanpuri in Calcutta. It is with them that you will have to wrestle. (Pointing to 










the people assembled there) These are mere sheep! 



















"Chaitanyadeva was an Incarnation of God. How little is left of what he accomplished-not to 










speak of a lecturer who preaches without authority from God! What good will a lecturer do? 



















Master exhorts the pundit to cultivate divine love 



















"Therefore I say to you, dive deep in God-Consciousness." 



















Saying this, the Master began to sing in an ecstasy of love for God: 



















Dive deep, mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God's Beauty; if you descend to the uttermost 










depths, there you will find the gem of Love. . . . 



















The Master continued: "One does not die if one sinks in this Ocean. This is the Ocean of 










Immortality. Once I said to Narendra: 'God is the Ocean of Bliss. Tell me if you want to plunge into 










It. Just imagine there is some syrup in a cup and that you have become a fly. Now tell me where 










you will sit to sip the syrup.' Narendra answered: 'I will, sit on the edge of the cup and stretch out 










my neck to drink, because I am sure to die if I go far into the cup.' Then I said to him: 'But my child, 










this is the Ocean of Satchidananda. There is no fear of death in it. This is the Ocean of Immortality. 










Only ignorant people say that one should not have an excess of devotion and divine love. How 










foolish ! Can there be any excess of divine love?' 



















(To the pundit) "Therefore I say to you, dive into the Ocean of Satchidananda. Nothing will 










ever worry you if you but realize God. Then you will get His commission to teach people. 



















MANY PATHS TO REALIZE GOD 



















"There are innumerable pathways leading to the Ocean of Immortality. The essential thing 










is to reach the Ocean. It doesn't matter which path you follow. Imagine that there is a reservoir 










containing the Elixir of Immortality. You will be immortal if a few drops of the Elixir somehow get 










into your mouth. You may get into the reservoir either by jumping into it, or by being pushed into 










it from behind, or by slowly walking down the steps. The effect is one and the same. You will 










become immortal by tasting a drop of that Elixir. 





































THREE YOGAS EXPLAINED BY MASTER 



















"Innumerable are the ways that lead to God. There are the paths of jnana, of karma, and of 










bhakti. If you are sincere, you will attain God in the end, whichever path you follow. Roughly 










speaking, there are three kinds of yoga: jnanayoga, karma yoga, and bhaktiyoga. 



















"What is jnanayoga? The Jnani seeks to realize Brahman. He discriminates, saying, 'Not this, 










not this'. He discriminates, saying, 'Brahman is real and the universe illusory.' He discriminates 










between the Real and the unreal. As he comes to the end of discrimination, he goes into samadhi 










and attains the Knowledge of Brahman. 



















"What is karmayoga? Its aim is to fix one's mind on God by means of work. That is what you 










are teaching. It consists of breath-control, concentration, meditation, and so on, done in a spirit of 










detachment. If a householder performs his duties in the world in a spirit of detachment, 










surrendering the results to God and with devotion to God in his heart, he too may be said to 










practise karmayoga. Further, if a person performs worship, japa, and other forms of devotion, 










surrendering the results to God, he may be said to practise karmayoga. Attainment of God alone is 










the aim of karmayoga. 



















"What is bhaktiyoga? It is to keep the mind on God by chanting His name and glories. For 










the Kaliyuga the path of devotion is easiest. This is indeed the path for this age. 



















Difficulties of the paths of jnana and karma 



















"The path of karma is very difficult. First of all, as I have just said, where will one find the 










time for it nowadays? Where is the time for a man to perform his duties as enjoined in the 










scriptures? Man's life is short in this age. Further, it is extremely difficult to perform one's duties in 










a spirit of detachment, without craving the result. One cannot work in such a spirit without first 










having realized God. Attachment to the result somehow enters the mind, though you may not be 










aware of it. 



















"To follow jnanayoga in this age is also very difficult. First, a man's life depends entirely on 










food. Second, he has a short span of life. Third, he can by no means get rid of body-consciousness; 










and the Knowledge of Brahman is impossible without the destruction of body-consciousness. The 










Jnani says: 'I am Brahman; I am not the body. I am beyond hunger and thirst, disease and grief, 










birth and death, pleasure and pain.' How can you be a Jnani if you are conscious of disease, grief, 










pain, pleasure, and the like? A thorn enters your flesh, blood flow from the wound, and you suffer 










very badly from the pain; but nevertheless, if you are a Jnani you must be able to say: 'Why, there 










is no thorn in my flesh at all. Nothing is the matter with me' 



















"Therefore bhaktiyoga is prescribed for this age. By following this path one comes to God 










more easily than by following the others. One can undoubtedly, reach God by following the paths 










of jnana and karma, but they are very difficult paths. 



















GOD FULFILS ALL DESIRES OF HIS DEVOTEES 



















"Bhaktiyoga is the religion for this age. But that does not mean that the lover of God will 










reach one goal and the philosopher and worker another. It means that if a person seeks the 





































Knowledge of Brahman he can attain It by following the path of bhakti, too. God, who loves His 










devotee, can give him the Knowledge of Brahman if He so desires. 



















"But the bhakta wants to realize the Personal God endowed with form and talk to Him. He 










seldom seeks the Knowledge of Brahman. But God, who does everything at His pleasure, can make 










His devotee the heir to His infinite glories if it pleases Him. He gives His devotee both the Love of 










God and the Knowledge of Brahman. If one is able somehow to reach Calcutta, one can see the 










Maidan and the museum and other places too. The thing is how to reach Calcutta. 



















"By realizing the Divine Mother of the Universe, you will get Knowledge as well as Devotion. 










You will get both. In bhava samadhi you will see the form of God, and in nirvikalpa samadhi you 










will realize Brahman, the Absolute Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. In nirvikalpa samadhi ego, name, 










and form do not exist. 



















DEVOTEE S PRAYER TO GOD 



















"A lover of God prays to the Divine Mother: '0 Mother, I am very much afraid of selfish 










actions. Such actions have desires behind them, and if I perform them I shall have to reap their 










fruit. But it is very difficult to work in a detached spirit. I shall certainly forget Thee, Mother, if I 










involve myself in selfish actions. Therefore I have no use for them. May my actions, Divine 










Mother, be fewer every day till I attain Thee. May I perform, without attachment to the results, 










only what action is absolutely necessary for me. May I have great love for Thee as I go on with my 










few duties. May I not entangle myself in new work so long as I do not realize Thee. But I shall 










perform it if I receive Thy command. Otherwise not.' " 



















ABOUT PILGRIMAGE 



















PUNDIT: "How far did you go in visiting the sacred places?" 



















MASTER: "Oh, I visited a few places. (With a smile) But Hazra went farther and also climbed 










higher. He visited Hrishikesh, but I didn't go so far or so high. 



















"You must pave noticed kites and vultures soaring very high in the sky; but their eyes are 










always fixed on the charnel-pits. Do you know the meaning of 'charnel-pits'? It is 'woman and 










gold'. 



















"What is the use of making pilgrimages if you can attain love of God remaining where you 










are? I have been to Benares and noticed the same trees there as here. The same green 










tamarind-leaves! 



















"Pilgrimage becomes futile if it does not enable you to attain love of God. Love of God is the 










one essential and necessary thing. Do you know the meaning of 'kites and vultures'? There are 










many people who talk big and who say that they have performed most of the duties enjoined in 










the scriptures. But with all that their minds are engrossed in worldliness and deeply preoccupied 










with money, riches, name, fame, creature comforts, and such things." 



















PUNDIT: "It is true, sir. Going on a pilgrimage is like seeking diamonds and gems, while 










discarding the precious stone that is worn by Narayana Himself on His breast." 





































MASTER: "I want you to remember this. You may impart thousands of instructions to 










people, but they will not bear fruit except in proper time. On going to bed, a child said to his 










mother, 'Mother, please wake me up when I feel the call of nature.' The mother said: 'Don't worry 










about it, my child. That call will wake you up itself.' (All laugh.) One feels yearning for God at the 










proper time. 



















THREE KINDS OF TEACHERS 



















"There are three classes of physicians. The physicians of one class feel the patient's pulse 










and go away, merely prescribing medicine. As they leave the room they simply ask the patient to 










take the medicine. They are the poorest class of physicians. Likewise, there are teachers who only 










give instruction, but do not stop to see whether their teachings have produced a good or bad 










effect. They do not think at all about the disciple. 



















"There are physicians of another class, who prescribe medicine and ask the patient to take 










it. If the patient is unwilling to follow their directions, they reason with him. They are the mediocre 










physicians. Likewise, there are mediocre teachers. They give instruction to the student and, 










further, try to persuade him in various ways to follow the instruction. 



















"Lastly, there are the physicians of the highest class. If the patient does not respond to their 










gentle persuasion, they even exert force upon him. If necessary, they press their knees on the 










patient's chest and force the medicine down his throat. Likewise, there are teachers of the highest 










class, who even exert force to direct the mind of the pupil toward God." 



















PUNDIT: Sir, if there are such superior teachers as you have described, then why should you 










say that one does not get the Knowledge of God until the right time comes?" 



















MASTER: "You are right. But what will the physician do if the medicine runs out of the 










patient's mouth and doesn't reach his stomach? In such a case even the best physician can't do 










anything. 



















"The teacher should judge the fitness of the student before giving him instruction. But you 










don't discriminate in your instruction. When a young man comes to me for instruction, first of all I 










ask him about his relatives at home. Suppose he has lost his father; suppose his father has left 










some debts for him. How can such a person direct his mind to God? Are you listening to me?" 



















PUNDIT: "Yes, sir. I am paying attention to every word." 



















MASTER: "One day some Sikh soldiers came to the temple garden at Dakshineswar. I met 










them in front of the Kali temple. One of them referred to God as very compassionate. 'Indeed!' I 










said. 'Is that true? But how do you know?' He answered, 



















'Because, sir, God gives us food and takes every care of us.' I said: 'Why should that surprise 










you? God is the Father of us all. Who will look after the child if the father doesn't? Do you mean to 










say that the people of the neighbouring village should look after the child?" 



















NARENDRA: "Then shouldn't we call God kind?" 





































MASTER: "Have I forbidden you to? What I mean is that God is our very own. He is not a 










stranger to us." 



















PUNDIT: "Priceless words!" 



















MASTER (to Narendra): "I listened to your singing, but I didn't enjoy it. So I left the room. 










Your mind is now set on seeking a job, and therefore your song sounded dull." 



















Narendra flushed. He felt ashamed of himself and remained silent. 



















The Master asked for a drink of water. A glass of water had been placed near him, but he 










could not take it. He asked for some fresh water. Later it was found that a man of immoral 










character had touched the first glass. 



















PUNDIT (to Hazra): "You live in his company day and night. You must be very happy." 



















MASTER (with a smile): "This is indeed a great occasion for me. Today I have seen the 










crescent moon of the second day of the bright fortnight. (All laugh.) Do you know why I referred to 










the moon of the second day? Sita once said to Ravana, 'You are the full moon and Rama is the 










crescent moon of the second day of the bright fortnight.' Ravana did not understand the meaning 










of these words. He thought Sita was flattering him and became exceedingly happy. But Sita meant 










that Ravana had reached the fullest limit of his power and prosperity, and that thenceforth he 










would wane like the full moon. Rama, on the other hand, was like the moon of the second day. He 










would wax day by day." 



















The Master was about to take his leave. The pundit and his friends bowed low before him. 



















It was not yet dusk, and Sri Ramakrishna returned to Ishan's house with the devotees. The 










Master took his seat in the drawing-room with Ishan and his sons, a pundit, and a few devotees. 



















MASTER (smiling to Ishan): "I said to Pundit Shashadhar: 'You have hardly set your foot on 










the tree, and yet you aspire to lay hold of a big bunch of fruit. First of all practise some spiritual 










discipline. Then you may teach others.' " 



















ISHAN: "Every preacher thinks that he enlightens others. The glowworm also may think that 










it illumines the world. Imagining this to be the glow-worm's feeling, someone said to it: '0 










glow-worm, how can you bring light to the world? You only reveal the intensity of the darkness.' " 



















MASTER (with a smile): "But Shashadhar is not just a scholar. He also has a little 










discrimination and dispassion." 



















A pundit who was present said to Sri Ramakrishna, "You are indeed a great soul." 



















MASTER: "You may say that about sages like Narada, Prahlada, or Sukadeva. I am like your 



















son. 



















"Of course, in one sense your words are true. It is said that in one respect the devotee of 










God is greater than God Himself, because he carries God in his heart. (All rejoice.) It is said in the 










Vaishnava books: 'A devotee regards himself as a higher, and God as a lower, being.' Yasoda, the 





































mother of Krishna, was about to fetter Krishna, who was God Incarnate, with chains. She believed 










that no one but herself could take care of Krishna. 



















"Sometimes God acts as the magnet and the devotee as the needle. God attracts the 










devotee to Himself. Again, sometimes the devotee acts as the magnet and God as the needle. Such 










is the attraction of the devotee that God comes to him, unable to resist his love." 



















The Master was about to leave for Dakshineswar. Ishan and the other devotees stood 










around him while he gave Ishan various words of advice. 



















ADVICE TO HOUSEHOLDERS 



















MASTER: "A devotee who can call on God while living a householder's life is a hero indeed. 










God thinks: 'He who has renounced the world for My sake will surely pray to Me. He must serve 










Me. Is there anything very remarkable about it? People will cry shame on him if he fails to do so. 










But he is blessed indeed who prays to Me in the midst of his worldly duties. He is trying to find Me, 










overcoming a great obstacle-pushing away, as it were, a huge block of stone weighing a ton. Such a 










man is a real hero.' " 



















PUNDIT: "You are right, sir. The scripture says the same thing. There is in the Mahabharata 










the story of the 'pious hunter' and the 'chaste woman'. Once a hermit was disturbed in his 










meditation by a crow. When he cast an angry glance at the bird, it was reduced to ashes. The 










hermit said to himself: 'I have destroyed the crow by a mere glance. I must have made great 










progress in spiritual life.' One day he went to a woman's house to beg his food. She was devoted to 










her husband and served him day and night; she provided him with water to wash his feet and even 










dried them with her hair. When the hermit knocked at her door for alms, she was serving her 










husband and could not open the door at once. The hermit, in a fit of anger, began to curse her. 










The chaste woman answered from the inner apartments: 'I am not your crow. Wait a few minutes, 










sir. After finishing my service to my husband I shall give you my attention.' The hermit was very 










much surprised to find that this simple woman was aware of his having burnt the crow to ashes. 










He wanted her to give him spiritual instruction. At her bidding he went to the 'pious hunter' at 










Benares. This hunter sold meat, but he also served his parents day and night as embodiments of 










God. The hermit said to himself in utter amazement: 'Why, he is a butcher and a worldly man! 










How can he give me the Knowledge of Brahman?' But the hunter was a knower of Brahman and 










had acquired divine knowledge through the performance of his worldly duties. The hermit was 










illumined by the instruction of the 'pious hunter'." 



















The Master was about to take his leave. He was standing at the door of the next house, 










where Ishan's father-in-law lived. Ishan and the other devotees stood by the Master. They were 










waiting to bid him good-bye. Sri Ramakrishna said to Ishan: "Live in the world like an ant. The 










world contains a mixture of truth and untruth, sugar and sand. Be an ant and take the sugar. 



















"Again, the world is a mixture of milk and water, the bliss of God-Consciousness and the 










pleasure of sense-enjoyment. Be a swan and drink the milk, leaving the water aside. 



















"Live in the world like a waterfowl. The water clings to the bird, but the bird shakes it off. 










Live in the world like a mudfish. The fish lives in the mud, but its skin is always bright and shiny. 





































"The world is indeed a mixture of truth and make-believe. Discard the make-believe and 










take the truth." 



















Sri Ramakrishna got into the carriage and left for Dakshineswar. 



















ADVICE TO PUNDIT SHASHADHAR 



















Monday, June 30, 1884 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was in his room, sitting on a mat spread on the floor. Pundit Shashadhar 










and a few devotees were with him on the mat, and the rest sat on the bare floor. Surendra, 










Baburam, M., Harish, Latu, Hazra, and others were present. It was about four o'clock in the 










afternoon. 



















Sri Ramakrishna had met Pundit Shashadhar six days before in Calcutta, and now the pundit 










had come to Dakshineswar to visit the Master. Bhudar Chattopadhyaya and his elder brother, the 










pundit's hosts, were with him. 



















NATURE OF BRAHMAN 



















The pundit was a follower of the path of jnana. The Master was explaining this path to him. 










He said: "Nitya and Lila are the two aspects of one and the same Reality. He who is the Indivisible 










Satchidananda has assumed different forms for the sake of His Lila." As he described the nature of 










the Ultimate Reality the Master every now and then became unconscious in samadhi. While he 










talked he was intoxicated with spiritual fervour. He said to the pundit: "My dear sir, Brahman is 










immutalble and immovable, like Mount Sumeru. But He who is 'immovable' can also 'move'." 



















GLORIES OF KALI 



















The Master was in ecstasy. He began to sing in his melodious voice: 



















Who is there that can understand what Mother Kali is? Even the six darsanas are powerless 










to reveal Her. . . . 



















He went on: 



















Is Mother merely a simple woman, born as others are born? Only by chanting Her holy 










name Does Siva survive the deadly poison. 



















She it is who creates the worlds, She who preserves and destroys, With a mere wink of Her 










wondrous eyes; She holds the universe in Her womb. 



















Seeking a shelter at Her feet, the gods themselves feel safe; And Mahadeva, God of Gods, 










Lies prostrate underneath Her feet. 



















Again he sang: 



















Is Mother only Siva's wife? To Her must needs bow down The all-destroying King of Death! 





































Naked She roams about the world, slaying Her demon foes, Or stands erect on Siva's breast. 










Her feet upon Her Husband's form! What a strange wife She makes! My Mother's play, declares 










Prasad, shatters all rules and laws: Strive hard for purity, mind, and understand my Mother's 










ways. 



















And again: 



















I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss, As I repeat my Mother Kali's name; It 










so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk! . . . 



















And again: 



















Can everyone have the vision of Syama? Is Kali's treasure for everyone? Oh, what a pity my 










foolish mind will not see what is true! Even with all His penances, rarely does Siva Himself behold 










The mind-bewitching sight of Mother Syama's crimson feet. To him who meditates on Her the 










riches of heaven are poor indeed; If Syama casts Her glance on him, he swims in Eternal Bliss. The 










prince of yogis, the king of the gods, meditate on Her feet in vain Yet worthless kamalakanta 










yearns for the Mother's blessed feet! 



















The Master's ecstatic mood gradually relaxed. He stopped singing and sat in silence. After a 










while he got up and sat on the small couch. 



















Pundit Shashadhar was charmed with his singing. Very humbly he said to Sri Ramakrishna, 










"Are you going to sing anymore?" 



















A little later the Master sang again: 



















High in the heaven of the Mother's feet, my mind was soaring like a kite, When came a blast 










of sin's rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth. . . . 



















Then he sang: 



















Once for all, this time, I have thoroughly understood; From One who knows it well, I have 










learnt the secret of bhava. A man has come to me from a country where there is no night, and now 










I cannot distinguish day from night any longer; Rituals and devotions have all grown profitless for 










me. My sleep is broken; how can I slumber any more? For now I am wide awake in the 










sleeplessness of yoga. Divine Mother, made one with Thee in yoga-sleep at last, My slumber I 










have lulled asleep for evermore. 



















I bow my head, says Prasad, before desire and liberation; Knowing the secret that Kali is 










one with the highest Brahman, I have discarded, once for all, both righteousness and sin. 



















Sri Ramakrishna continued: 



















I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the Mother; Am I afraid of Death any 










more? Unto the tuft of hair on my head. Is tied the almighty mantra, Mother Kali's name. My body 










I have sold in the market-place of the world And with it have bought Sri Durga's name. 



















As Sri Ramakrishna sang the line, "And with it have bought Sri Durga's name", the tears 










flowed from Pundit Shashadhar's eyes. The Master went on with the song: 





































Deep within my heart I have planted the name of Kali, The Wish-fulfilling Tree of heaven; 










When Yama, King of Death, appears, to him I shall open my heart and show it growing there. I have 










cast out from me my six unflagging foes;4 Ready am I to sail life's sea, Crying, "To Durga, victory!" 



















Again he sang: 



















Dwell, mind, within yourself; enter no other's home. If you but seek there, you will find all 










you are searching for. . . . 



















And again: 



















Though I am never loath to grant salvation, I hesitate indeed to grant pure love. Whoever 










wins pure love surpasses all; He is adored by men; He triumphs over the three worlds. . . . 



















Mere study of scriptures is futile 



















The pundit had studied the Vedas and the other scriptures. He loved to discuss philosophy. 










The Master, seated on the couch, cast his benign look on the pundit and gave him counsel through 










parables. 



















MASTER (to the pundit): "There are many scriptures like the Vedas. But one cannot realize 










God without austerity and spiritual discipline. 'God cannot be found in the six systems, the Vedas, 










or the Tantra.' 



















"But one should learn the contents of the scriptures and then act according to their 










injunctions. A man lost a letter. He couldn't remember where he had left it. He began to search for 










it with a lamp. After two or three people had searched, the letter was at last found. The message 










in the letter was: 'Please send us five seers of sandesh and a piece of wearing-cloth.' The man read 










it and then threw the letter away. There was no further need of it; now all he had to do was to buy 










the five seers of sandesh and the piece of cloth. 



















READING, HEARING, AND SEEING 



















"Better than reading is hearing, and better than hearing is seeing. One understands the 










scriptures better by hearing them from the lips of the guru or of a holy man. Then one doesn't 










have to think about their non-essential part. 



















Hanuman said: 'Brother, I don't know much about the phase of the moon or the position of 










the stars. I just contemplate Rama.' 



















"But seeing is far better than hearing. Then all doubts disappear. It is true that many things 










are recorded in the scriptures; but all these are useless without the direct realization of God, 










without devotion to His Lotus Feet, without purity of heart. The almanac forecasts the rainfall of 










the year. But not a drop of water will you get by squeezing the almanac. No, not even one drop. 



















"How long should one reason about the texts of the scriptures? So long as one does not 










have direct realization of God. How long does the bee buzz about? As long as it is not sitting on a 










flower. No sooner does it light on a flower and begin to sip honey than it keeps quiet. 





































"But you must remember another thing. One may talk even after the realization of God. But 










then one talks only of God and of Divine Bliss. It is like a drunkard's crying, 'Victory to the Divine 










Mother!' He can hardly say anything else on account of his drunkenness. You can notice, too, that 










a bee makes an indistinct humming sound after having sipped the honey from a flower. 



















THE NATURE OF JNANIS AND VIJNANIS 



















"The Jnani reasons about the world through the process of 'Neti, neti', 'Not this, not this'. 










Reasoning in this way, he at last comes to a state of Bliss, and that is Brahman. What is the nature 










of a Jnani? He behaves according to scriptural injunctions. 



















"Once I was taken to Chanak and saw some sadhus there. Several of them were sewing. (All 










laugh.) At the sight of us they threw aside their sewing. They sat straight, crossing their legs, and 










conversed with us. (All laugh.) 



















"But jnanis will not talk about spiritual things without being asked. They will inquire, at first, 










about such things as your health and your family. 



















"But the nature of the vijnani is different. He is unconcerned about anything. Perhaps he 










carries his wearing-cloth loose under his arm, like a child; or perhaps the cloth has dropped from 










his body altogether. 



















"The man who knows that God exists is called a Jnani. A Jnani is like one who knows beyond 










a doubt that a log of wood contains fire. But a vijnani is he who lights the log, cooks over the fire, 










and is nourished by the food. The eight fetters have fallen from the vijnani. He may keep merely 










the appearance of lust, anger, and the rest." 



















PUNDIT: "The knots of his heart are cut asunder; all his doubts are destroyed." 



















MASTER: "Yes. Once a ship sailed into the ocean. Suddenly its iron joints, nails, and screws 










fell out. The ship was passing a magnetic hill, and so all its iron was loosened. 



















"I used to go to Krishnakishore's house. Once, when I was there, he said to me, 'Why do you 










chew betel-leaf?' I said: 'It is my sweet pleasure. I shall chew betel-leaf, look at my face in the 










mirror, and dance naked among a thousand girls.' Krishnakishore's wife scolded him and said: 










'What have you said to Ramakrishna? You don't know how to talk to people.' 



















"In this state, passions like lust and anger are burnt up, though nothing happens to the 










physical body. It looks just like any other body; but the inside is all hollow and pure." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Does the body remain even after the realization of God?" 



















MASTER: "The body survives with some so that they may work out their prarabdha karma 










or work for the welfare of others. By bathing in the Ganges a man gets rid of his sin and attains 










liberation. But if he happens to be blind, he doesn't get rid of his blindness. Of course, he escapes 










future births, which would otherwise be necessary for reaping the results of his past sinful karma. 










His present body remains alive as long as its momentum7 is not exhausted; but future births are 










no longer possible. The wheel moves as long as the impulse that has set it in motion lasts. Then it 





































comes to a stop. In the case of such a person, passions like lust and anger are burnt up. Only the 










body remains alive to perform a few actions." 



















PUNDIT: "That is called samskara." 



















THE NATURE OF JNANIS AND VIJNANIS 



















MASTER: "The vijnani always sees God. That is why he is so indifferent about the world. He 










sees God even with his eyes open. Sometimes he comes down to the Lila from the Nitya, and 










sometimes he goes up to the Nitya from the Lila." 



















PUNDIT: "I don't understand that." 



















MASTER: "The Jnani reasons about the world through the process of 'Neti, neti', and at last 










reaches the Eternal and Indivisible Satchidananda. He reasons in this manner: 'Brahman is not the 










living beings; it is neither the universe nor the twenty-four cosmic principles.' As a result of such 










reasoning he attains the Absolute. Then he realizes that it is the Absolute that has become all 










this-the universe, its living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles. 



















"Milk sets into curd, and the curd is churned into butter. After extracting the butter one 










realizes that butter is not essentially different from buttermilk and buttermilk not essentially 










different from butter. The bark of a tree goes with the pith and the pith goes with the bark." 



















PUNDIT (smiling, to Bhudar): "Did you understand that? It is very difficult." 



















ALL-EMBRACING REALIZATION OF THE VIJNANI 



















MASTER: "If there is butter, there must be buttermilk also. If you think of butter, you must 










also think of buttermilk along with it; for there cannot be any butter without buttermilk. Just so, if 










you accept the Nitya, you must also accept the Lila. It is the process of negation and affirmation. 










You realize the Nitya by negating the Lila. Then you affirm the Lila, seeing in it the manifestation of 










the Nitya. One attains this state after realizing Reality in both aspects: Personal and Impersonal. 










The Personal is the embodiment of Chit, Consciousness; and the Impersonal is the Indivisible 










Satchidananda. 



















"Brahman alone has become everything. Therefore to be vijnani this world is a 'mansion of 










myrth'. But to the Jnani it is a 'framework of illusion'. Ramprasad described the world as a 










'framework of illusion'. Another man said to him by way of retort: 



















This very world is a mansion of myrth; here I can eat, here drink and make merry. 










physician, you are a fool ! You see only the surface of things. Janaka's might was unsurpassed; what 










did he lack of the world or the Spirit? Holding to one as well as the other, He drank his milk from a 










brimming cup! 



















"The vijnani enjoys the bliss of God in a richer way. Some have heard of milk, some have 










seen it, and some have drunk it. The vijnani has drunk milk, enjoyed it, and been nourished by it." 



















The Master remained silent a few moments and then asked Pundit Shashadhar to have a 










smoke. The Pundit went to the south east verandah to smoke. Soon he came back to the room and 





































sat on the floor with the devotees. Seated on the small couch, the Master continued the 










conversation. 



















MASTER (to the Pundit): "Let me tell you something. There are three kinds of Ananda, joy: 










the joy of worldly enjoyment, the joy of worship, and the Joy of Brahman. The joy of worldly 










enjoyment is the joy of 'woman and gold', which people always enjoy. The joy of worship one 










enjoys while chanting the name and glories of God. And the Joy of Brahman is the joy of 










God-vision. After experiencing the joy of God-vision the rishis of olden times went beyond all rules 










and conventions. 



















THREE STATES OF GOD-CONSCIOUSNESS 



















"Chaitanyadeva used to experience three spiritual states: the inmost, the semiconscious, 










and the conscious. In the inmost state he would see God and go into samadhi. He would be in the 










state of jada samadhi. In the semi-conscious state he would be partially conscious of the outer 










world. In the conscious state he could sing the name and glories of God." 



















HAZRA (to the Pundit): "So your doubts are now solved." 










SAMADHI described 



















MASTER (to the Pundit): "What is samadhi? It is the complete merging of the mind in 










God-Consciousness. The Jnani experiences jada samadhi, in which no trace of T is left. The 










samadhi attained through the path of bhakti is called 'chetana samadhi'. In this samadhi there 










remains the conciousness of T — the T of the servant-and-Master relationship, of the 










lover-and-Beloved relationship, of the enjoyer-and-Food relationship. God is the Master; the 










devotee is the servant. God is the beloved; the devotee is the lover. God is the Food, and the 










devotee is the enjoyer. 'I don't want to be sugar. I want to eat it.' " 



















PUNDIT: "What will happen if God dissolves all of the T, if He changes the enjoyer himself 










into sugar?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "Come, come! Tell me what is in your mind. But don't the scriptures 










mention Narada, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sananda, and Sanatkumara?" 



















PUNDIT: "Yes, sir. They do." 



















MASTER: "Though they were jnanis, yet they kept the T of the bhakta. Haven't you read the 










Bhagavata?" 



















PUNDIT: "I have read only part of it, not the whole." 



















MASTER: "Pray to God. He is full of compassion. Will He not listen to the words of His 










devotee? He is the Kalpataru. You will get whatever you desire from Him." 





































PUNDIT: "I haven't thought deeply about these things before. But now I understand." 





































MASTER: "God keeps a little of T in His devotee even after giving him the Knowledge of 










Brahman. That T is the 'I of the devotee', the 'I of the Jnani'. Through that T the devotee enjoys 










the infinite play of God. 



















"The pestle was almost worn out with rubbing. Only a little was left. That fell into the 










underbrush and brought about the destruction of the lunar race, the race of the Yadus. The vijnani 










retains the 'I of the devotee', the 'I of the Jnani', in order to taste the Bliss of God and teach 










people. 



















"The rishis of old had timid natures. They were easily frightened. Do you know their 










attitude? It was this: 'Let me somehow get my own salvation; who cares for others?' A hollow 










piece of drift-wood somehow manages to float; but it sinks if even a bird sits on it. But Narada and 










sages of his kind are like a huge log that not only can float across to the other shore but can carry 










many animals and other creatures as well. A steamship itself crosses the ocean and also carries 










people across. 



















THE VIJNANI IS FEARLESS AND JOYOUS 



















"Teachers like Narada belong to the class of the vijnani. They were much more courageous 










than the other rishis. They are like an expert satrancha-player. You must have noticed how he 










shouts, as he throws the dice: 'What do I want? Six? No, five! Here is five!' And every time he 










throws the dice he gets the number he wants. He is such a clever player! And while playing he 










even twirls his moustaches. 



















"A mere Jnani trembles with fear. He is like an amateur satrancha-player. He is anxious to 










move his pieces somehow to the safety zone, where they won't be overtaken by his opponent. But 










a vijnani isn't afraid of anything. He has realized both aspects of God: Personal and Impersonal. He 










has talked with God. He has enjoyed the Bliss of God. 



















"It is a joy to merge the mind in the Indivisible Brahman through contemplation. And it is 










also a joy to keep the mind on the Lila, the Relative, without dissolving it in the Absolute. 



















"A mere Jnani is a monotonous person. He always analyses, saying: 'It is not this, not this. 










The world is like a dream.' But I have 'raised both my hands'. Therefore I accept everything. 



















PARABLE OF THE WEAVER WOMAN 



















"Listen to a story. Once a woman went to see her weaver friend. The weaver, who had been 










spinning different kinds of silk thread, was very happy to see her friend and said to her: 'Friend, I 










can't tell you how happy I am to see you. Let me get you some refreshments.' She left the room. 










The woman looked at the threads of different colours and was tempted. She hid a bundle of 










thread under one arm. The weaver returned presently with the refreshments and began to feed 










her guest with great enthusiasm. But, looking at the thread, she realized that her friend had taken 










a bundle. Hitting upon a plan to get it back, she said: 'Friend, it is so long since I have seen you. 










This is a day of great joy for me. I feel very much like asking you to dance with me.' The friend said, 










'Sister, I am feeling very happy too.' So the two friends began to dance together. When the weaver 










saw that her friend danced without raising her hands, she said: 'Friend, let us dance with both 





































hands raised. This is a day of great joy.' But the guest pressed one arm to her side and danced 










raising only the other. The weaver said: 'How is this, friend? Why should you dance with only one 










hand raised? Dance with me raising both hands. Look at me. See how I dance with both hands 










raised.' But the guest still pressed one arm to her side. She danced with the other hand raised and 










said with a smile, 'This is all I know of dancing.' " 



















The Master continued: "I don't press my arm to my side. Both my hands are free. I am not 










afraid of anything. I accept both the Nitya and the Lila, both the Absolute and the Relative. 



















THE TWO KINDS OF EGO 



















"I said to Keshab Sen that he would not be able to realize God without renouncing the ego. 










He said, 'Sir, in that case I should not be able to keep my organization together.' Thereupon I said 










to him: 'I am asking you to give up the "unripe ego", the "wicked ego". But there is no harm in the 










"ripe ego", the "child ego", the "servant ego", the "ego of Knowledge".' 



















"The worldly man's ego, the 'ignorant ego', the 'unripe ego', is like a thick stick. It divides, as 










it were, the water of the Ocean of Satchidananda. But the 'servant ego', the 'child ego', the 'ego of 










Knowledge', is like a line on the water. One clearly sees that there is only one expanse of water. 










The dividing line makes it appear that the water has two parts, but one clearly sees that in reality 










there is only one expanse of water. 



















"Sankaracharya kept the 'ego of Knowledge' in order to teach people. God keeps in many 










people the 'ego of a Jnani' or the 'ego of a bhakta' even after they have attained Brahmajnana. 










Hanuman, after realizing God in both His Personal and His Impersonal aspect, cherished toward 










God the attitude of a servant, a devotee. He said to Rama: '0 Rama, sometimes I think that You are 










the whole and I am a part of You. Sometimes I think that You are the Master and I am Your 










servant. And sometimes, Rama, when I contemplate the Absolute, I see that I am You and You are 










I.' 



















"Yasoda became grief-stricken at being separated from Krishna, and called on Radha. Radha 










saw Yasoda's suffering and revealed herself to her as the divine Sakti, which was her real nature. 










She said to Yasoda: 'Krishna is Chidatma, Absolute Consciousness, and I am ChitSakti, the Primal 










Power. Ask a boon of Me: Yasoda said: 'I don't want Brahmajnana. Please grant me only this: that I 










may see the form of Gopala in my meditation; that I may always have the company of Krishna's 










devotees; that I may always serve the devotees of God; that I may always chant God's name and 










glories.' 



















"Once the gopis felt a great desire to see the forms of the Lord. So Krishna asked them to 










dive into the water of the Jamuna. No sooner did they dive into the water than they all arrived at 










Vaikuntha. There they saw the form of the Lord endowed with His six celestial splendours. But 










they did not like it. They said to Krishna: 'We want to see Gopala and serve Him. Please grant us 










that boon alone. We don't want anything else.' 



















"Before His departure for Mathura, Krishna wanted to give the Knowledge of Brahman to 










the gopis. He said to them: 'I dwell both inside and outside all beings. Why should you see only one 





































form of Mine?' The gopis cried in chorus: '0 Krishna, do You want to go away from us? Is that why 










You are instructing us in Brahmajnana?' 



















"Do you know the attitude of the gopis? It is this: 'We are Radha's and Radha is ours.' " 



















A DEVOTEE: "Does this T of the devotee never disappear altogether?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, it disappears at times. Then one attains the Knowledge of Brahman and goes 










into samadhi. I too lose it, but not for all the time. In the musical scale there are seven notes: sa, 










re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni. But one cannot keep one's voice on 'ni' a long time. One must bring it 










down again to the lower notes. I pray to the Divine Mother, 'Mother, do not give me 










Brahmajnana.' Formerly believers in God with form used to visit me a great deal. Then the modern 










Brahmajnanis began to arrive. During that period I used to remain unconscious in samadhi most of 










the time. Whenever I regained consciousness, I would say to the Divine Mother, '0 Mother, please 










don't give me Brahmajnana.'" 



















GOD LISTENS TO OUR PRAYER 



















PUNDIT: "Does God listen to our prayers?" 



















MASTER: "God is the Kalpataru, the Wish-fulfilling Tree. You will certainly get whatever you 










ask of Him. But you must pray standing near the Kalpataru. Only then will your prayer be fulfilled. 










But you must remember another thing. God knows our inner feeling. A man gets the fulfillment of 










the desire he cherishes while practising sadhana. As one thinks, so one receives. A magician was 










showing his tricks before a king. Now and then he exclaimed: 'Come confusion! Come delusion! 










King, give me money! Give me clothes!' Suddenly his tongue turned upward and clove to the roof 










of his mouth. He experienced kumbhaka. He could utter neither word nor sound, and became 










motionless. People thought he was dead. They built a vault of bricks and buried him there in that 










posture. After a thousand years someone dug into the vault. Inside it people found a man seated 










in samadhi. They took him for a holy man and worshipped him. When they shook him his tongue 










was loosened and regained its normal position. The magician became conscious of the outer world 










and cried, as he had a thousand years before: 'Come confusion! Come delusion! King, give me 










money! Give me clothes!' 



















"I used to weep, praying to the Divine Mother, '0 Mother, destroy with Thy thunderbolt my 










inclination to reason.' " 



















PUNDIT: "Then you too had an inclination to reason?" 



















MASTER :"Yes, once." 



















PUNDIT: "Then please assure us that we shall get rid of that inclination too. How did you get 










rid of yours?" 



















MASTER: "Oh, somehow or other." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was silent awhile. Then he went on with his conversation. 





































MASTER: "God is the Kalpataru. One should pray standing near It. Then one will get 










whatever one desires. 



















"How many things God has created! Infinite is His universe. But what need have I to know 










about His infinite splendours? If I must know these, let me first realize Him. Then 



















God Himself will tell me all about them. What need have I to know how many houses and 










how many government securities Jadu Mallick possesses? All that I need is somehow to converse 










with Jadu Mallick. I may succeed in seeing him by jumping over a ditch or through a petition or 










after being pushed about by his gate-keeper. Once I get a chance to talk to him, then he himself 










will tell me all about his possessions if I ask him. If one becomes acquainted with the master, then 










one is respected by his officers too. (All laugh.) 



















"There are some who do not care to know the splendours of God. What do I care about 










knowing how many gallons of wine there are in the tavern? One bottle is enough for me. Why 










should I desire the knowledge of God's splendours? I am intoxicated with the little wine I have 










swallowed. 



















"Both bhaktiyoga and jnanayoga are paths by which you can realize God. Whatever path 










you may follow, you will certainly realize Him. The path of bhakti is an easy one. The path of 










knowledge and discrimination is very difficult. Why should one reason so much to know which 










path is the best? I talked about this with Vijay for many days. Once I told him about a man who 










used to pray, '0 God, reveal to me who and what You are.' 



















"The path of knowledge and discrimination is difficult indeed. Parvati, the Divine Mother, 










revealed Her various forms to Her father and said, 'Father, if you want Brahmajnana, then live in 










the company of holy men.' 



















"Brahman cannot be described in words. It is said in the Rama Gita that Brahman has only 










been indirectly hinted at by the scriptures. When one speaks about the 'cowherd village on the 










Ganges', one indirectly states that the village is situated on the bank of the Ganges. 



















"Why shouldn't a man be able to realize the formless Brahman? But it is extremely difficult. 










He cannot if he has even the slightest trace of worldliness. He can be directly aware of Brahman in 










his inmost consciousness only when he renounces all senseobjects— form, taste, smell, touch, and 










sound and only when his mind completely stops functioning. And then too, he knows only this 










much of Brahman— that It exists." 



















Quoting from an Upanishad, the pundit said, "It is to be experienced only as Existence." 



















MASTER: "In order to realize God a devotee should make use of a particular attitude-the 










attitude of a 'hero' or a friend or a handmaid or a child." 



















MANI MALLICK: "Only then can one feel attached to God." 



















MASTER: "For many days I cherished the feeling that I was a companion of the Divine 










Mother. I used to say: 'I am the hand maid of Brahmamayi, the Blissful Mother. companions of 





































the Divine Mother, make me the Mother's handmaid! I shall go about proudly, saying, "I am 










Brahmamayi's handmaid!" 



















DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PERFECT SOULS 



















"Some souls realize God without practising any spiritual discipline. They are called 










nityasiddha, eternally perfect. Those who have realized God through austerity, japa, and the like, 










are called sadhanasiddha, perfect through spiritual discipline. Again, there are those called 










kripasiddha, perfect through divine grace. These last may be compared to a room kept dark a 










thousand years, which becomes light the moment a lamp is brought in. 



















"There is also a class of devotees, the hathatsiddha, that is to say, those who have suddenly 










attained God-vision. Their case is like that of a poor boy who has suddenly found favour with a rich 










man. The rich man marries his daughter to the boy and along with her gives him land, house, 










carriage, servants, and so forth. 



















"There is still another class of devotees, the svapnasiddha, who have had the vision of God 










in a dream." 



















SURENDRA (smiling): "Let us go to sleep then. We shall wake and find ourselves babus, 










aristocrats." 



















MASTER (tenderly): "You are already a babu. When the letter 'a' is joined to the letter 'ka', 










'ka' becomes 'kaa'. It is futile to add another 'a'. If you add it, you will still have the same 'kaa'. (All 










laugh.) 



















DESCRIPTION OF THE NITYA SIDDHA 



















"The nityasiddha is in a class apart. He is like arani wood. A little rubbing produces fire. You 










can get fire from it even without rubbing. The nityasiddha realizes God by practising slight spiritual 










discipline and sometimes without practising any at all. But he does practise spiritual discipline after 










realizing God. He is like the gourd or pumpkin vine— first fruit, then flower." 



















The pundit smiled at this illustration. 



















MASTER: "There is the instance of Prahlada. He was a nityasiddha. While writing the letter 










'ka' he shed a stream of tears." 



















The Master was pleased with the pundit's humility. He praised him to the devotees. 



















MASTER: "He has such a nice nature. You find no difficulty in driving a nail into a mud wall. 










But its point breaks if you try to drive it against a stone; and still it will not pierce it. There are 










people whose spiritual consciousness is not at all awakened even though they hear about God a 










thousand times. They are like a crocodile, on whose hide you cannot make any impression with a 










sword." 





































PUNDIT: "But one can hurt a crocodile by throwing a spear into its belly." (All laugh.) 





































MASTER (smiling): "What good is there in reading a whole lot of scriptures? What good is 










there in the study of philosophy? What is the use of talking big? In order to learn archery one 










should first aim at a banana tree, then at a reed, then at a wick, and last at a flying bird. At the 










beginning one should concentrate on God with form. 



















"Then there are devotees who are beyond the three gunas. They are eternally devoted to 










God, like Narada. These devotees behold Krishna as Chinmaya, all Spirit, His Abode as Chinmaya, 










His devotee as Chinmaya. To them God is eternal, His Abode is eternal, His devotee is eternal. 



















"Those who reason and speculate following the process of 'Neti, neti' do not accept the 










Incarnation of God. Hazra says well that Divine Incarnation is only for the bhakta, and not for the 










Jnani, because the Jnani is quite contented with his ideal, 'I am He'." 



















Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees remained silent awhile. The pundit resumed the 










conversation. 



















PUNDIT: "Sir, how does one get rid of callousness? Laughter makes me think of muscles and 










nerves. Grief makes me think of the nervous system." 



















MASTER (smiling): "That is why Narayan Shastri used to say, the harmful effect of the study 










of the scriptures is that it encourages reasoning and arguing.'" 



















PUNDIT: "Is there no way for us then?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, there is the path of discrimination. In a song occurs the line: 'Ask her son 










Discrimination about the Truth.' 



















"The way lies through discrimination, renunciation, and passionate yearning for God. Unless 










a man practises discrimination, he cannot utter the right words. One time, after expounding 










religion at great length, Pundit Samadhyayi said, 'God is dry.' He reminded me of the man who 










once said, 'My uncle's cow-shed is full of horses.' Now, does anyone keep horses in a cowshed? 










(With a smile) You have become like a chanabara fried in butter. Now it will be good for you and 










for others as well, if you are soaked in syrup a few days. Just a few days." 



















PUNDIT (smiling): "The sweetmeat is over-fried. It has become charred." 



















MASTER (with a laugh): "No! No! It is brown as a cockroach. Just the right colour." 



















HAZRA: "The sweetmeat is well cooked. It has become spongy. Now it will soak up the syrup 










nicely." 



















MASTER: "You see, there is no need to read too much of the scriptures. If you read too 










much you will be inclined to reason and argue. Nangta used to teach me thus: What you get by 










repeating the word 'Gita' tell times is the essence of the book. In other words, if you repeat 'Gita' 










ten times it is reversed into 'tagi', which indicates renunciation. 



















"Yes, the way to realize God is through discrimination, renunciation, and yearning for Him. 










What kind of yearning? One should yearn for God as the cow, with yearning heart, runs after its 










calf." 





































PUNDIT: "The same thing is said in the Vedas: '0 God, we call on Thee as the cow lows for 










the calf.'" 



















MASTER: "Add your tears to your yearning. And if you can renounce everything through 










discrimination and dispassion, then you will be able to see God. That yearning brings about 










God-intoxication, whether you follow the path of knowledge or the path of devotion. The sage 










Durvasa was mad with the Knowledge of God. 



















"There is a great deal of difference between the knowledge of a householder and that of an 










all-renouncing sannyasi. The householder's knowledge is like the light of a lamp, which illumines 










only the inside of a room. He cannot see anything, with the help of such knowledge, except his 










own body and his immediate family. But the knowledge of the all-renouncing monk is like the light 










of the sun. Through that light he can see both, inside and outside the room. Chaitanyadeva's 










knowledge had the brilliance of the sun-the sun of Knowledge. Further, he radiated the soothing 










light of the moon of Devotion. He was endowed with both-the Knowledge of Brahman and ecstatic 










love of God. 



















(To the pundit) "One can attain spiritual consciousness through both affirmation and 










negation. There is the positive path of love and devotion, and there is the negative path of 










knowledge and discrimination. You are preaching the path of knowledge. But that creates a very 










difficult situation: there the guru and the disciple do not see each other. Sukadeva went to Janaka 










for instruction about the Knowledge of Brahman. Janaka said to him: 'You must pay me the guru's 










fee beforehand. When you attain the knowledge of Brahman you won't pay me the fee, because 










the knower of Brahman sees no difference between the guru and the disciple.' 



















DIFFERENT STAGES OF DIVINE LOVE 



















"Both negation and affirmation are ways to realize one and the same goal. Infinite are the 










opinions and infinite are the ways. But you must remember one thing. The injunction is that the 










path of devotion described by Narada is best suited to the Kaliyuga. According to this path, first 










comes bhakti; then bhava, when bhakti is mature. Higher than bhava are mahabhava and prema. 










An ordinary mortal does not attain mahabhava and prema. He who has achieved these has 










realized the goal, that is to say, has attained God." 



















PUNDIT: "In expounding religion one has to use a great many words." 



















MASTER: "While preaching, eliminate the 'head and tail', that is to say, emphasize only the 










essentials." 



















The pundit and Mani Mallick became engaged in conversation. Mani was a member of the 










Brahmo Samaj. The pundit argued vehemently about the good and bad sides of the Samaj. Sri 










Ramakrishna was seated on the small couch and looked on, smiling. Presently he remarked: "This 










is the tamasic aspect of sattva, the attitude of a hero. This is necessary. One should not hold one's 










tongue at the sight of injustice and untruth. Suppose a bad woman wants to drag you from the 










path of righteousness. You must then assume the heroic attitude and say: 'What? You witch! You 










dare injure my spiritual life? I shall cut your body in two right now.' " 





































With a smile Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit: "Mani Mallick has been following the 










tenets of the Brahmo Samaj a long time. You can't convert him to your views. Is it an easy thing to 










destroy old tendencies? Once there lived a very pious Hindu who always worshipped the Divine 










Mother and chanted Her name. When the Mussalmans conquered the country, they forced him 










embrace Islam. They said to him: 'You are now a Mussalman. Say "Allah". From now on you must 










repeat only the name of Allah.' With great difficulty he repeated the word 'Allah', but every now 










and then blurted out 'Jagadamba'. At that the Mussalmans were about to beat him. Thereupon he 










said to them: 'I beseech you! Please do not kill me. I have been trying my utmost to repeat the 










name of Allah, but our Jagadamba has filled me up to the throat. She pushes out your Allah.' (All 










laugh.) 



















DIFFERENT PATHS TO SUIT DIFFERENT TASTES 



















(To the pundit) "Please don't say anything to Mani Mallick. You must know that there are 










different tastes. There are also different powers of digestion. God has made different religions and 










creeds to suit different aspirants. By no means all are fit for the Knowledge of Brahman. Therefore 










the worship of God with form has been provided. 



















"The mother brings home a fish for her children. She curries part of the fish, part she fries, 










and with another part she makes pilau. By no means all can digest the pilau. So she makes fish 










soup for those who have weak stomachs. Further, some want pickled or fried fish. There are 










different temperaments. There are differences in the capacity to comprehend." 



















All sat in silence. Sri Ramakrishna said to the pundit, "Go and visit the temples and take a 










stroll in the garden." It was about half past five in the afternoon. The pundit left the room with his 










friends and several of the devotees. 



















After a while the Master went with M. toward the bathing-ghat on the Ganges. He said to 










M., "Baburam now says, 'What shall I gain by study?' "On the bank of the river he met the pundit 










and said to him, "Aren't you going to the Kali temple?" The pundit said: "Yes, sir. Let us go 










together." With a smiling face Sri Ramakrishna proceeded to the temple through the courtyard. 










He said to the pundit, "Listen to a song." 



















He sang: 



















Is Kali, my Mother, really black? The Naked One, of blackest hue, Lights the Lotus of the 










Heart 



















As he was going through the courtyard, he quoted to the pundit from a song: 



















Lighting the lamp of Knowledge in the chamber of your heart, Behold the face of the 










Mother, Brahman's Embodiment. 



















They came to the temple. Sri Ramakrishna saluted the Divine Mother, touching the ground 










with his forehead. 



















Red hibiscus flowers and vilwa-leaves adorned the Mother's feet. Her three eyes radiated 










love for Her devotees. Two of Her hands were raised as if to give them boons and reassurance; the 





































other two hands held symbols of death. She was clothed in a sari of Benares silk and was decked 










with ornaments. 



















IMAGE OF KALI 



















Referring to the image, one of the parties remarked, "I heard it was made by the sculptor 










Nabin." The Master answered: "Yes, I know. But to me She is the Embodiment of Spirit." 



















As Sri Ramakrishna was coming back to his room with the devotees, he said to Baburam, 










"Come with us." M. also joined them. 



















It was dusk. The Master was sitting on the semicircular porch west of his room. Baburam 










and M. sat near him. He was in a mood of partial ecstasy. 



















Rakhal was not then living with Sri Ramakrishna, and therefore the Master was having 










difficulties about his personal service. Several devotees lived with him, but he could not bear the 










touch of everyone during his spiritual moods. He hinted to Baburam: "Do stay with me. It will be 










very nice. In this mood I cannot allow others to touch me." 



















The pundit entered the Master's room after visiting the temples. The Master said to him 










from the porch, "Take some refreshments." The pundit said that he had not yet performed his 










evening devotions. At once Sri Ramakrishna stood up and sang in an exalted mood: 



















Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas, So long as I can breathe my 










last with Kali's name upon my lips? What need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any 










more, If he repeats the Mother's name at the three holy hours? . . . 



















Intoxicated With ecstatic love, the Master said: "How long should one perform devotions? 










So long as one's mind does not merge in God while repeating Om." 



















PUNDIT: "Then let me eat the refreshments. I shall perform the devotions later on." 



















MASTER: "No, I don't want to obstruct the current of your life. It is not good to renounce 










anything before the proper time arrives. When the fruit ripens, the flower drops off of itself. One 










shouldn't forcibly tear off the green branch of a coconut tree. That injures the tree." 



















Surendra was about to leave. He invited his friends into his carriage. The Master, still in an 










ecstatic mood, said, "Don't take more people than your horse can draw." Suredra took leave of Sri 










Ramakrishna. The pundit left the room to perform his worship. M. and Baburam saluted the 










Master. They were about to leave for Calcutta. Sri Ramakrishna was still in an ecstatic mood. 



















MASTER (to M.): "I cannot utter a word now. Stay a few minutes." 



















M. again took his seat and waited for the Master's command. Sri Ramakrishna motioned to 










Baburam to take a seat and asked him to fan him a little. M. also took part in rendering this 










personal service to the Master. 



















MASTER (to M., tenderly): "Why don't you come here so frequently now?" 



















M: "Not for any special reason. I have been rather busy at home." 





































MASTER: "Yesterday I came to know Baburam's inner nature. That is why I have been trying 










so hard to persuade him to live with me. The mother bird hatches the egg in proper time. Boys like 










Baburam are pure in heart. They have not yet fallen into the clutches of 'woman and gold'. Isn't 










that so?" 



















M: "It is true, sir. They are still stainless." 



















MASTER: "They are like a new pot. Milk kept in it will not turn sour." 










M: "Yes, sir." 



















MASTER: "I need Baburam here. I pass through certain spiritual states when I need 










someone like him. He says he must not, all at once, live with me permanently, for it will create 










difficulties. His relatives will make trouble. I am asking him to come here Saturdays and Sundays." 



















MASTER'S ADVICE TO HOUSEHOLDERS 



















The pundit entered the room with his friends. He had finished his devotions and was ready 










to eat the refreshments. One of his companions asked the Master: "Shall we succeed in spiritual 










life? Please tell us what our way is." 



















MASTER: "You all have the yearning for liberation. If an aspirant has yearning, that is 










enough for him to realize God. Don't eat any food of the sraaddha ceremony. Live in the world like 










an unchaste woman. She performs her household duties with great attention, but her mind dwells 










day and night on her paramour. Perform your duties in the world but keep your mind always fixed 










on God. 



















The pundit finished eating his refreshments. 



















MASTER (to the pundit): "You have read the Gita, no doubt. It says that there is a special 










power of God in the man who is honoured and respected by all." 



















The pundit quoted the verse from the Gita. 



















MASTER: "You surely possess divine power." 



















PUNDIT: "Shall I labour with perseverance to finish the task that I have accepted?" 



















Sri Ramakrishna forced himself, as it were, to say, "Yes." He soon changed the conversation. 



















MASTER: "One cannot but admit the manifestation of power. Vidyasagar once asked me, 










'Has God given more power to some than to others?' I said to him: 'Certainly. Otherwise, how can 










one man kill a hundred? If there is no special manifestation of power, then why is Queen Victoria 










so much honoured and respected? Don't you admit it?' He agreed with me." 



















The pundit and his friends saluted the Master and were about to take their leave. Sri 










Ramakrishna said to the pundit: "Come again. One hemp-smoker rejoices in the company of 










another hemp-smoker. They even embrace each other. But they hide at the sight of people not of 










their own kind. A cow licks the body of her calf; but she threatens a strange cow with her horns." 










(All laugh.) 





































The pundit left the room. With a smile the Master said: "He has become 'diluted' even in 










one day. Did you notice how modest he was? And he accepted everything I said." 



















Moonlight flooded the semicircular porch. Sri Ramakrishna was still seated there. M. was 










about to leave. 



















MASTER (tenderly): "Must you go now?" 



















M.: "Yes, sir. Let me say good-bye." 



















MASTER: "I have been thinking of visiting the houses of the devotees. I want to visit yours 










also. What do you say?" 



















M.: "That will be very fine." 



















Thursday, July 3, 1884 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in Balaram Bose's house in Calcutta. It was the day of the 










"Return Car Festival". The Lord of the Universe was worshipped in Balaram's house as Jagannath. 










There was a small car in the house for use during the Car Festival. 



















BALARAM'S father 



















Balaram's father was a pious Vaishnava who devoted most of his time to prayer and 










meditation in his garden house at Vrindavan. He also studied devotional books and enjoyed the 










company of devotees. Balaram had brought his father to Calcutta to meet the Master. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was in a very happy mood. Seated near him were Ram, Balaram, Balaram's 










father, M., Manomohan, and several young devotees. He was conversing with them. 



















DOGMATISM IN RELIGION 



















MASTER (to Balaram's father and the others): "The Bhaktamala is one of the Vaishnava 










books. It is a fine book. It describes the lives of the various Vaishnava devotees. But it is one-sided. 










At one place the author found peace of mind only after compelling Bhagavati, the Divine Mother, 










to take Her initiation according to the Vaishnava discipline. 



















"Once I spoke highly of Vaishnavcharan to Mathur and persuaded him to invite 










Vaishnavcharan to his house. Mathur welcomed him with great courtesy. He fed his guest from 










silver plates. Then do you know what happened? Vaishnav said in front of Mathur, 'You will 










achieve nothing whatsoever in spiritual life unless you accept Krishna as your Ideal.' Mathur was a 










follower of the Sakta cult and a worshipper of the Divine Mother. At once his face became 










crimson. I nudged Vaishnavcharan. 



















"I understand that the Bhagavata also contains some statements like that. I hear that it is 










said there that trying to cross the ocean of the world without accepting Krishna as the Ideal Deity 










is like trying to cross a great sea by holding the tail of a dog. Each sect magnifies its own view. 



















"The Saktas, too, try to belittle the Vaishnavas. The Vaishnavas say that Krishna alone is the 










Helmsman to take one across the ocean of the world. The Saktas retort: 'Oh, yes! We agree to 





































that. Our Divine Mother is the Empress of the Universe. Why should She bother about a 










ferry-boat? Therefore She has engaged that fellow Krishna for the purpose.' (All laugh.) 



















"Besides, how vain people are about their own sects! There are weavers in the villages near 










Kamarpukur. Many of them are Vaishnavas and like to talk big. They say: 'Which Vishnu does he 










worship? The Preserver? Oh, we wouldn't touch him!' Or: 'Which Siva are you talking about? We 










accept the Atmaramasiva.' Or again, 'Please explain to us which Hari you worship'. They spin their 










yarn and indulge in talk like that. 



















"Rati's mother, Rani Katyayani's favourite confidante, is a follower of Vaishnavcharan. She is 










a bigoted Vaishnava. She used to visit me very frequently, and none could outdo her in devotion. 










One day she noticed me eating the prasad from the Kali temple. Since then I haven't seen even her 










shadow. 



















MASTER'S HARMONY OF RELIGIONS 



















"He is indeed a real man who has harmonized everything. Most people are one-sided. But I 










find that all opinions point to the One. All views-the Sakta, the Vaishnava, the Vedanta-have that 










One for their centre. He who is formless is, again, endowed with form. It is He who appears in 










different forms: The attributeless Brahman is my Father. God with attributes is my Mother. Whom 










shall I blame? Whom shall I praise? The two pans of the scales are equally heavy.' 



















"He who is described in the Vedas is also described in the Tantras and the Puranas. All of 










them speak about the one Satchidananda. The Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of the one 










Reality. It is described in the Vedas as 'Om Satchidananda Brahman', in the Tantras as 'Om 










Satchidananda Siva', the ever-pure Siva, and in the Puranas as 'Om Satchidananda Krishna'. All the 










scriptures, the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras, speak only of one Satchidananda. It is stated in 










the Vaishnava scripture that it is Krishna Himself who has become Kali." 



















Sri Ramakrishna went to the porch for a few minutes and then returned. As he was going 










out, Vishvamvhar's daughter, six or seven years old, saluted him. On returning to the room, the 










Master began talking to the little girl and her companions, who were of the same age. 



















THE CHILD (to the Master): "I saluted you and you didn't even notice it." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Did you? I really didn't notice." 



















CHILD: "Then wait. I want to salute you again-the other foot too." 



















Sri Ramakrishna laughed and sat down. He returned the salute and bowed to the child, 










touching the ground with his forehead. He asked her to sing. The child said, "I swear I don't sing." 










When the Master pressed her again, she said, "Should you press me when I said 'I swear'?" The 










Master was very happy with the children and sang light and frivolous songs to entertain them. He 










sang: 



















Come, let me braid your hair, Lest your husband should scold you When he beholds you! 










The children and the devotees laughed. 





































CHILDLIKE NATURE OF A P ARAM AH AM S A 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "The paramahamsa is like a five-year-old child. He sees 










everything filled with Consciousness. At one time I was staying at Kamarpukur when Shivaram was 










four or five years old. One day he was trying to catch grasshoppers near the pond. The leaves were 










moving. To stop their rustling he said to the leaves: 'Hush! Hush! I want to catch a grasshopper.' 










Another day it was stormy. It rained hard. Shivaram was with me inside the house. There were 










flashes of lightning. He wanted to open the door and go out. I scolded him and stopped him, but 










still he peeped out now and then. When he saw the lightning he exclaimed, 'There, uncle! They are 










striking matches again!' 



















"The paramahamsa is like a child. He cannot distinguish between a stranger and a relative. 










He isn't particular about worldly relationships. One day Shivaram said to me, 'Uncle, are you my 










father's brother or his brother-in-law?' 



















"The paramahamsa is like a child. He doesn't keep any track of his whereabouts. He sees 










everything as Brahman. He is indifferent to his own movements. Shivaram went to Hriday's house 










to see the Durga Puja. He slipped out of the house and wandered away. A passer-by saw the child, 










who was then only four years old, and asked, 'Where do you come from?' He couldn't say much. 










He only said the word 'hut'. He was speaking of the big hut in which the image of the Divine 










Mother was being worshipped. The stranger asked him further, 'Whom are you living with?' He 










only said the word 'brother'. 



















OTHER TRAITS OF A PARAMAHAMSA 



















"Sometimes the paramahamsa behaves like a madman. When I experienced that divine 










madness I used to worship my own sexual organ as the Siva-phallus. But I can't do that now. A few 










days after the dedication of the temple at Dakshineswar, a madman came there who was really a 










sage endowed with the Knowledge of Brahman. He had a bamboo twig in one hand and a potted 










mango-plant in the other, and was wearing torn shoes. He didn't follow any social conventions. 










After bathing in the Ganges he didn't perform any religious rites. He ate something that he carried 










in a corner of his wearing-cloth. Then he entered the Kali temple and chanted hymns to the Deity. 










The temple trembled. Haladhari was then in the shrine. The madman wasn't allowed to eat at the 










guest-house, but he paid no attention to this slight. He searched for food in the rubbish heap 










where the dogs were eating crumbs from the discarded leaf-plates. Now and then he pushed the 










dogs aside to get his crumbs. The dogs didn't mind either. Haladhari followed him and asked: 'Who 










are you? Are you a purnajnani?' The madman whispered, 'Sh! Yes, I am a purnajnani.' My heart 










began to palpitate as Haladhari told me about it. I clung to Hriday. I said to the Divine Mother, 










'Mother, shall I too have to pass through such a state?' We all went to see the man. He spoke 










words of great wisdom to us but behaved like a madman before others. Haladhari followed him a 










great way when he left the garden. After passing the gate he said to Haladhari: 'What else shall I 










say to you? When you no longer make any distinction between the water of this pool and the 










water of the Ganges, then you will know that you have Perfect Knowledge.' Saying this he walked 










rapidly away." 



















Sri Ramakrishna began to talk with M. Other devotees, too, were present. 





































MASTER (to M.): "How do you feel about Shashadhar?" 










M: "He is very nice." 



















MASTER: "He is very intelligent, isn't he?" 










M: "Yes, sir. He is very erudite." 



















MASTER: "According to the Gita there is a power of God in one who is respected and 










honoured by many. But Shashadhar has still a few things to do. 



















What will he accomplish with mere scholarship? He needs to practise some austerity. It is 










necessary to practise some spiritual discipline. 



















"Gauri Pundit practised austerity. When he chanted a hymn to the Divine Mother, the other 










pundits would seem no more than earthworms. 



















"Narayan Shastri was not merely a scholar, either. He practised sadhana as well. He studied 










for twenty-five years without a break. Nyaya alone, he studied for seven years. Still he would go 










into ecstasy while repeating the name of Siva. The King of Jaipur wanted to make him his court 










pundit, but Narayan refused. He used to spend much time here. He had a great desire to go to the 










Vasishtha Asrama to practise tapasya. He often spoke to me about it, but I forbade him to go 










there. At that he said: 'Who knows when I shall die? When shall I practise sadhana? Any day I may 










crack.' After much insistence on his part I let him go. Some say that he is dead, that he died while 










practising austerity. Others say that he is still alive and that they saw him off on a railway train. 



















MASTER AND KESHAB 



















"Before meeting Keshab, I asked Narayan Shastri to visit him and tell me what he thought of 










him. Narayan reported that Keshab was an adept in japa. He knew astrology and remarked that 










Keshab had been born under a good star. Then I went to visit Keshab in the garden house at 










Belgharia. Hriday was with me. The moment I saw Keshab, I said: 'Of all the people I see here, he 










alone has dropped his tail. He can now live on land as well as in water, like a frog.' 



















"Keshab sent three members of the Brahmo Samaj to the temple garden at Dakshineswar to 










test me. Prasanna was one of them. They were commissioned to watch me day and night, and to 










report to Keshab. They were in my room and intended to spend the night there. They constantly 










uttered the word 'Dayamaya' and said to me: 'Follow Keshab Babu. That will do you good.' I said, 'I 










believe in God with form.' Still they went on with their exclamations of 'Dayamaya!' Then a strange 










mood came over me. I said to them, 'Get out of here!' I didn't allow them to spend the night in my 










room. So they slept on the verandah. Captain also spent the night in the temple garden the first 










time he visited me. 



















"Michael visited the temple garden when Narayan Shastri was living with me. Dwarika 










Babu, Mathur's eldest son, brought him here. The owners of the temple garden were about to get 










into a lawsuit with the English proprietors of the neighbouring powder magazine; so they wanted 










Michael's advice. I met him in the big room next to the manager's office. Narayan Shastri was with 










me. I asked Narayan to talk to him. Michael couldn't talk very well in Sanskrit. He made mistakes. 





































Then they talked in the popular dialect. Narayan Shastri asked him his reason for giving up the 










Hindu religion. Pointing to his stomach, Michael said, 'It was for this.' Narayan said, 'What shall I 










say to a man who gives up his religion for his belly's sake?' Thereupon Michael asked me to say 










something. I said: 'I don't know why, but I don't feel like saying anything. Someone seems to be 










pressing my tongue.' " 



















MANOMOHAN: "Mr. Choudhury will not come. He said: 'That fellow Shashadhar from 










Faridpur will be there. I shall not go.' " 



















Mr. Choudhury had obtained his Master's degree from Calcutta University. He drew a salary 










of three or four hundred rupees. After the death of his first wife he had felt intense dispassion for 










the world, but after some time he had married again. He frequently visited the Master at the 










temple garden. 



















MASTER: "How mean of him! He is vain of his scholarship. Besides, he has married a second 










time. He looks on the world as a mere mud-puddle. 



















(To the devotees) "This attachment to 'woman and gold' makes a man small-minded. When 










I first saw Haramohan he had many good traits. I longed to see him. He was then seventeen or 










eighteen years old. I used to send for him every now and then, but he wouldn't come. He is now 










living away from the family with his wife. He had been living with his uncle before. That was very 










good. He had no worldly troubles. Now he has a separate home and does the marketing for his 










wife daily. The other day he came to Dakshineswar. I said to him: 'Go away. Leave this place. I 










don't even feel like touching you.' " 



















Sri Ramakrishna went to the inner apartments to see the Deity. He offered some flowers. 










The ladies of Balaram's family were pleased to see him. 



















The Master came back to the drawing-room and said: "The worldly minded practise 










devotions, japa, and austerity only by fits and starts. But those who know nothing else but God 










repeat His name with every breath. Some always repeat mentally, 'Om Rama'. Even the followers 










of the path of knowledge repeat, 'Soham', 'I am He'. There are others whose tongues are always 










moving, repeating the name of God. One should remember and think of God constantly." 



















Pundit Shashadhar entered the room with one or two friends and saluted the Master. 



















MASTER (smiling): "We are like the bridesmaids waiting near the bed for the arrival of the 










groom." 



















The pundit laughed. The room was filled with devotees, among them Dr.Pratap and 










Balaram's father. The Master continued his talk. 



















MASTER (to Shashadhar): "The first sign of knowledge is a peaceful nature, and the second 










is absence of egotism. You have both. There are other indications of a Jnani. He shows intense 










dispassion in the presence of a sadhu, is a lion when at work, for instance, when he lectures, and is 










full of wit before his wife. (All laugh.) 





































"But the nature of the vijnani is quite different, as was the case with Chaitanyadeva. He acts 










like a child or a madman or an inert thing or a ghoul. While in the mood of a child, he sometimes 










shows childlike guilelessness, sometimes the frivolity of adolescence, and sometimes, while 










instructing others, the strength of a young man." 



















THREE KINDS OF BHAKTI 



















PUNDIT: "By what kind of bhakti does one realize God?" 



















MASTER: "Three kinds of bhakti are found, according to the nature of the man: sattvic 










bhakti, rajasic bhakti, and tamasic bhakti. 



















"Sattvic bhakti is known to God alone. It makes no outward display. A man with such 










devotion loves privacy. Perhaps he meditates inside the mosquito net, where nobody sees him. 










When this kind of devotion is awakened, one hasn't long to wait for the vision of God. The 










appearance of the dawn in the east shows that the sun will rise before long. 



















"A man with rajasic bhakti feels like making a display of his devotion before others. He 










worships the Deity with 'sixteen ingredients', enters the temple wearing a silk cloth, and puts 










around his neck a string of rudraksha beads interspersed here and there with beads of gold and 










ruby. 



















"A man with tamasic bhakti shows the courage and boisterousness of a highway robber. A 










highway robber goes on his expedition openly, shouting, 'Kill! Plunder!' He isn't afraid even of 










eight police inspectors. The devotee with tamasic bhakti also shouts like a madmam'Hara! Hara! 










Vyom! Vyom! Victory to Kali!' He has great strength of mind and burning faith. 



















"A Sakta has such faith. He says: 'What? I have uttered once the name of Kali and of Durga! I 










have uttered once the name of Rama! Can there be any sin in me?' 



















"The Vaishnavas have a very humble and lowly attitude. (Looking at Balaram's father) They 










tell their rosary and whine and whimper: '0 Krishna, be gracious to us! We are wretched! We are 










sinners!' 



















FAITH IN GOD'S NAME 



















"A man should have such fiery faith as to be able to say, 'I have uttered the name of God; 










how can I be a sinner?' Imagine a man repeating the name of Hari day and night and at the same 










time saying that he is a sinner!" 



















So saying, Sri Ramakrishna became overwhelmed with divine ecstasy and sang: 



















If only I can pass away repeating Durga's name, How canst Thou then, Blessed One, 










Withhold from me deliverance, Wretched though I may be? I may have stolen a drink of wine, or 










killed a child unborn, Or slain a woman or a cow, Or even caused a brahmin's death; But, though it 










all be true, Nothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness; For through the power of Thy 










sweet name 



















My wretched soul may still aspire Even to Brahmanhood. 





































He sang again: 



















Behold my Mother playing with Siva, lost in an ecstasy of joy! Drunk with a draught of 










celestial wine, She reels, and yet She does not fall. Erect She stands on Siva's bosom, and the earth 










trembles under Her tread; She and Her Lord are mad with frenzy, casting aside all fear and shame! 



















Pundit Shashadhar was weeping. Vaishnavcharan, the musician, sang: 



















tongue, always repeat the name of Mother Durga! Who but your Mother Durga will save 










you in distress? Thou art the heavens and the earth, and Thou the nether world; From Thee have 










the twelve Gopalas and Hari and Siva sprung. The ten Embodiments of Divine Sakti art Thou, And 










Thou the ten Avatars: this time, save me Thou must! The moving and the unmoving, the gross and 










the subtle, art Thou; Creation and preservation art Thou, and the last dissolution. Thou art the 










Primal Root of this manifold universe; The Mother of the three worlds, their only Saviour, art Thou; 










Thou art the Sakti of all, and Thou Thine own Sakti, too. 



















As the Master listened to the last few lines, he went into an ecstatic mood. The Master 










himself sang: 



















Mother, for Yasoda Thou wouldst dance, when she called Thee her precious "Blue Jewel"; 










where hast Thou hidden that lovely form, terrible Syama? Dance that way once for me, 










Mother! Throw down Thy sword and take the flute; Cast off Thy garland of heads, and wear Thy 










wild-flower garland. If without Siva Thou canst not dance, then let Balarama be Thy Siva. Dance, 










Syama, as Thou didst dance when Thou wert Krishna! Mother, play on Thy flute again, once so full 










of delight for the gopis; Play again on Thy magic flute, which called the cattle in from the pasture, 










Stopping the Jamuna's murmuring flow and turning it backward. Hot in the sky the sun would 










burn, when Yasoda, restless for her Krishna, Fondly would call: "Here, my Gopala! Cream and 










butter-eat them, my Darling!" And she would comb His long black hair and carefully braid it. 










Bending Thy supple body, Mother, both at the neck, the waist, and the knee, Thou didst dance 










with Thy friend Sridama, while Thy two anklets played the music: Ta-thaia! Ta-thaia! Ta-ta! 










Thaia-thaia! Hearing their captivating sound, the gopis would rush there. 



















Again Pundit Shashadhar shed tears of love. 



















Sri Ramakrishna came down to consciousness of the world. Pointing to Shashadhar, he said 










to M., "Why don't you prod him?" He wanted M. or some other devotee to ask Shashadhar a 










question. 



















RAMDAYAL (to Shashadhar): "The scriptures speak of Brahman's form as a projection of 










mind. Who is it that projects?" 



















SHASHADHAR: "It is Brahman Itself that does so. It is no projection of a man's mind." 



















PRATAP: "Why does Brahman project the form?" 



















MASTER: "You ask why? Brahman doesn't act in consultation with others. It is Brahman's 










pleasure. Brahman is self-willed. Why should we try to know the reason for Brahman's acting this 










way or that? You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes. Eat the mangoes. What is the good of 





































calculating how many trees there are in the orchard, how many thousands of branches, and how 










many millions of leaves? One cannot realize Truth by futile arguments and reasoning." 



















PRATAP: "Shouldn't we reason any more then?" 



















MASTER: "I am asking you not to indulge in futile reasoning. But reason, by all means, about 










the Real and the unreal, about what is permanent and what is transitory. You must reason when 










you are overcome by lust, anger, or grief." 



















SHASHADHAR: "That is different. It is called reasoning based on discrimination." 



















MASTER: "Yes, discrimination between the Real and the unreal." 



















All sat in silence. Again the Master spoke, addressing the pundit. 



















MASTER: "Formerly many great men used to come here." 



















SHASHADHAR: "You mean rich people?" 



















MASTER: "No. Great scholars." 



















In the mean time the small car of Jagannath had been brought to the verandah. Inside the 










car were the images of Krishna, Balarama, and Subhadra. They were adorned with flowers, 










garlands, jewelry, and yellow apparel. Balaram was a sattvic worshipper: there was no outward 










grandeur in his worship. Outsiders did not even know of this Car Festival at his house. The Master 










and the devotees went to the verandah. Sri Ramakrishna pulled the car by the rope. Then he 










began to sing: 



















See how all Nadia is shaking Under the waves of Gauranga's love. . . . 










He sang again: 



















Behold, the two brothers have come, who weep while chanting Hari's name, the brothers 










who, in return for blows, offer to sinners Hari's love. . . . 



















Sri Ramakrishna danced with the devotees. The musician and his party joined the Master in 










the music and dancing. Soon the whole verandah was filled with people. The ladies witnessed this 










scene of joy from an adjoining room. It appeared as if Chaitanya himself were dancing with his 










devotees, intoxicated with divine love. 



















It was not yet dusk. Sri Ramakrishna returned to the drawing-room with the devotees. 



















MASTER (to Shashadhar): "This is called bhajanananda, the bliss of devotees in the worship 










of God. Worldly people keep themselves engrossed in the joy of sensuous objects, of 'woman and 










gold'. Through worship devotees receive the grace of God, and then His vision. Then they enjoy 










Brahmananda, the Bliss of Brahman." 



















Shashadhar and the devotees listened to these words with rapt attention. 



















SHASHADHAR (humbly): "Sir, please tell us what kind of yearning gives one this blissful state 










of mind." 





































MASTER: "One feels restless for God when one's soul longs for His vision. The guru said to 










the disciple: 'Come with me. I shall show you what kind of longing will enable you to see God.' 










Saying this, he took the disciple to a pond and pressed his head under the water. After a few 










moments he released the disciple and asked, 'How did you feel?' The disciple answered: 'Oh, I felt 










as if I were dying! I was longing for a breath of air.' " 



















SHASHADHAR: "Yes! Yes! That's it. I understand it now." 



















MASTER: "To love God is the essence of the whole thing. Bhakti alone is the essence. 










Narada said to Rama, 'May I always have pure love for Your Lotus Feet; and may I not be deluded 










by Your world-bewitching maya!' Rama said to him, 'Ask for some other boon.' 'No,' said Narada, 'I 










don't want anything else. May I have love for Your Lotus Feet. This is my only prayer.' " 



















Pundit Shashadhar was ready to leave. Sri Ramakrishna asked a devotee to bring a carriage 










for the pundit. 



















SHASHADHAR: "Don't trouble yourself. I shall walk." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Oh, how can that be? You are beyond the reach of even Brahma's 










meditation." 



















SHASHADHAR: "There is no particular need of my going just now. The only thing is that I 










shall have to perform my sandhya." 



















MASTER: "The Divine Mother has taken away my sandhya and other devotions. The 










purpose of the sandhya is to purify body and mind. I am no longer in that state." 



















The Master sang the following lines of a song: 



















When will you learn to lie, mind, in the abode of Blessedness, With Cleanliness and 










Defilement on either side of you? Only when you have found the way to keep these wives 










contentedly under a single roof, Will you behold the matchless form of Mother Syama. 



















Pundit Shashadhar saluted the Master and went away. 



















RAM: "I visited Shashadhar yesterday. You asked me to." 



















MASTER: "Did I? I don't remember. But it is nice that you went." 



















RAM: "The editor of a newspaper was abusing you." 



















MASTER: "Suppose he was. What does it matter?" 



















RAM: "Please listen. Then I began to talk to the editor about you. He wanted to hear more 










and wouldn't let me go." 



















It was dusk. Sri Ramakrishna began to chant the names of the Divine Mother, Krishna, 










Rama, and Hari. The devotees sat in silence. The Master chanted the names in such sweet tones 










that the hearts of the devotees were deeply touched. That day Balaram's house was like Navadvip 





































when Chaitanya lived there. On the verandah it was like Navadvip, and in the parlour it was like 










Vrindavan. 



















That same night Sri Ramakrishna was to go to Dakshineswar. Balaram took him into the 










inner apartments and served him with refreshments. The ladies of the family saluted the Master. 



















The devotees were singing kirtan in the drawing-room, awaiting the Master's coming. 










Presently Sri Ramakrishna came and joined the singers. 



















The kirtan went on: 



















Behold, my Gora is dancing! With the devotees He dances in Srivas's courtyard, singing the 










kirtan. Gora says to all, "Repeat the name of Hari!" He looks at Gadadhar, and from his red eyes 










Are flowing tears of love over his golden body. 



















The Master improvised the lines: 



















Gora is dancing in the kirtan: There he dances, Sachi's darling! There he dances, my 










Gauranga! There he dances, my soul's beloved! 



















FESTIVAL AT ADHAR'S HOUSE 



















Sunday, August 3, 1884 



















SRI RAMAKRISHNA was sitting in his room in the temple garden at Dakshineswar after his 










midday meal. A party of Bauls from Shibpur, several devotees from Bhawanipur, Balaram, and M. 










were in the room. Rakhal, Latu, and Harish were then living with the Master. They too were 










present. 



















The Master began the conversation by addressing the Baul musicians from Shibpur. 



















YOGA AND THE SIX CENTRES 



















MASTER: "Yoga is not possible if the mind dwells on 'woman and gold'. The mind of a 










worldly man generally moves among the three lower centres: those at the navel, at the sexual 










organ, and at the organ of evacuation. After great effort and spiritual practice the Kundalini is 










awakened. According to the yogis there are three nerves in the spinal column: Ida, Pingala, and 










Sushumna. Along the Sushumna are six lotuses, or centres, the lowest being known as the 










Muladhara. Then come successively Svadhisthana, Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha, and Ajna. 










These are the six centres. The Kundalini, when awakened, passes through the lower centres and 










comes to the Anahata, which is at the heart. It stays there. At that time the mind of the aspirant is 










withdrawn from the three lower centres. He feels the awakening of Divine Consciousness and sees 










Light. In mute wonder he sees that radiance and cries out: 'What is this? What is this?' 



















"After passing through the six centres, the Kundalini reaches the thousand petalled lotus 










known as the Sahasrara, and the aspirant goes into samadhi. 





































"According to the Vedas these centres are called 'bhumi', 'planes'. There are seven such 










planes. The centre at the heart corresponds to the fourth plane of the Vedas. According to the 










Tantra there is in this centre a lotus called Anahata, with twelve petals. 



















"The centre known as Visuddha is the fifth plane. This centre is at the throat and has a lotus 










with sixteen petals. When the Kundalini reaches this plane, the devotee longs to talk and hear only 










about God. Conversation on worldly subjects, on 'woman and gold', causes him great pain. He 










leaves a place where people talk of these matters. 



















"Then comes the sixth plane, corresponding to the centre known as Ajna. This centre is 










located between the eyebrows and it has a lotus with two petals. When the Kundalini reaches it, 










the aspirant sees the form of God. But still there remains a slight barrier between the devotee and 










God. It is like a light inside a lantern. You may think you have touched the light, but in reality you 










cannot because of the barrier of glass. 



















"And last of all is the seventh plane, which, according to Tantra, is the centre of the 










thousand-petalled lotus. When the Kundalini arrives there, the aspirant goes into samadhi. In that 










lotus dwells Satchidananda Shiva, the Absolute. There Kundalini, the awakened Power, unites with 










Shiva. This is known as the union of Shiva and Sakti. 



















THE STATE OF SAMADHI 



















"When the Kundalini rises to the Sahasrara and the mind goes into samadhi, the aspirant 










loses all consciousness of the outer world. He can no longer retain his physical body. If milk is 










poured into his mouth, it runs out again. In that state the life-breath lingers for twenty-one days 










and then passes out. Entering the 'black waters' of the ocean, the ship never comes back. But the 










Isvarakotis, such as the Incarnations of God, can come down from this state of samadhi. They can 










descend from this exalted state because they like to live in the company of devotees and enjoy the 










love of God. God retains in them the 'ego of Knowledge' or the 'ego of Devotion' so that they may 










teach men. Their minds move between the sixth and the seventh planes. They run a boat-race 










back and forth, as it were, between these two planes. 



















KEEPING INDIVIDUALITY AFTER SAMADHI 



















"After attaining samadhi some souls of their own accord keep the 'ego of Knowledge'. But 










that ego does not create any attachment. It is like a line drawn on the water. 



















"Hanuman kept the 'servant ego' after realizing God in both His Personal and His 










Impersonal aspects. He thought of himself as the servant of God. The great sages, such as Narada, 










Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara, after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman, kept the 










'servant ego' and the 'ego of Devotion'. They are like big steamships, which not only cross the 










ocean themselves but carry many passengers to the other shore. 





































TWO CLASSES OF PARAMAHAMSAS 



















"There are two classes of paramahamsas, one affirming the formless Reality and the other 










affirming God with form. Trailanga Swami believed in the formless Reality. Paramahamsas like him 










care for their own good alone; they feel satisfied if they themselves attain the goal. 



















PARAMAHAMSAS AS TEACHERS OF MEN 



















"But those paramahamsas who believe in God with form keep the love of God even after 










attaining the Knowledge of Brahman, so that they may teach spiritual truth to others. They are like 










a pitcher brimful of water. Part of the water may be poured into another pitcher. These perfected 










souls describe to others the various spiritual disciplines by which they have realized God. They do 










this only to teach others and to help them in spiritual life. With great effort men dig a well for 










drinking water, using spades and baskets for the purpose. After the digging is over, some throw 










the spades and other implements into the well, not needing them any more. But some put them 










away near the well, so that others may use them. 



















"Some eat mangoes secretly and remove all trace of them by wiping their mouths with a 










towel. But some share the fruit with others. There are sages who, even after attaining Knowledge, 










work to help others and also to enjoy the Bliss of God in the company of devotees. 'I want to eat 










sugar. I don't want to be sugar.' 



















"The Gopis of Vrindavan, too, attained the Knowledge of Brahman; but they were not 










seeking It. They wanted to enjoy God, looking on themselves as His mother, His friend, His 










handmaid, or His lover." 



















The Bauls from Shibpur began to sing to the accompaniment of a stringed instrument. A line 










in the first song was: 



















We are sinners: redeem us, merciful Lord! 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "It is the attitude of a beginner to worship God out of fear. 










Please sing about God-realization-songs expressing divine joy. 



















(To Rakhal ) "How well they sang that song the other day at Nabin Niyogi's house: 'Be drunk, 










mind, be drunk with the Wine of Heavenly Bliss'! While singing religious songs one should not 










constantly refer to one's worries. One should rather feel joyous and ecstatic as one chants God's 










name. 



















A DEVOTEE: "Sir, won't you sing?" 



















MASTER: "What shall I sing? Well, I may sing when the spirit moves me." 










Master sings of divine joy 



















After a few minutes the Master began to sing. His eyes were turned upward. 





































He sang: 





































Behold the waves of Gora's ecstatic love; under them all the universe lies submerged! And 










in his love I, too, long to be drowned. friend, Gauranga's love has swallowed me; who else feels 










for our misery like Gauranga, Dragging us from the mire of worldliness? 



















He sang again: 



















Dive deep, mind, dive deep in the Ocean of God's Beauty; if you descend to the uttermost 










depths, there you will find the gem of Love. . . . 



















Then he sang about the Divine Mother: 



















Can everyone have the vision of Syama? Is Kali's treasure for everyone? Oh, what a pity my 










foolish mind will not see what is true !. . . 



















He continued: 



















The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight To the blue lotus flower of Mother 










Syama'sfeet. . . . 



















And again: 



















Mother, what a machine is this that Thou hast made! What pranks Thou playest with this 










toy Three and a half cubits high! . . . 



















As Sri Ramakrishna sang the last song he went into samadhi. The devotees sat speechless, 










gazing at his radiant figure. After some time he regained partial consciousness of the world and 










began to talk to the Divine Mother. 



















The Master said, "Mother, please come down from up there." Did he feel his mind still 










lingering in the seventh plane of consciousness, the thousand petalled lotus of the Sahasrara? 










"Please do come down", he said. "Don't torment me that way. Be still, Mother, and sit down. 



















"0 Mother, everybody's future is determined by the tendencies of his previous births. What 










shall I say to these people? Nothing can be achieved without discrimination and renunciation." 



















RENUNCIATION, TRUE AND FALSE 



















Sri Ramakrishna had now regained full consciousness of the world, and he continued: 










"There are many kinds of renunciation. One of them may be called 'Markata Vairagya', 'Monkey 










Renunciation'. It is a false renunciation stimulated by the afflictions of the world. That renunciation 










doesn't last long. Then there is real renunciation. A man with everything in the world, lacking 










nothing, feels all to be unreal. 



















"It is not possible to acquire renunciation all at once. The time factor must be taken into 










account. But it is also true that a man should hear about it. When the right time comes, he will 










say to himself, 'Oh yes, I heard about this.' 



















"You must also remember another thing. By constantly hearing about renunciation one's 










desire for worldly objects gradually wears away. One should take rice-water in small doses to get 










rid of the intoxication of liquor. Then one gradually becomes normal. 





































"An aspirant entitled to the Knowledge of God is very rare. It is said in the Gita that one in 










thousands desires to know God, and again, that among thousands who have such a desire, only 










one is able to know Him." 



















A devotee quoted the text from the Gita. 



















MASTER: "As your attachment to the world diminishes, your spiritual knowledge will 










increase. Attachment to the world means attachment to 'woman and gold'. 



















PREMA, THE RAREST LOVE OF GOD 



















"It is not given to everybody to feel prema, ecstatic love of God. Chaitanya experienced it. 










An ordinary man can at the most experience bhava. Only the Isvarakotis, such as 



















Divine Incarnations, experience prema. When prema is awakened the devotee not only 










feels the world to be unreal, but forgets even the body, which everyone loves so intensely. 



















"In a Persian book it is said that inside the skin is the flesh, inside the flesh the bone, inside 










the bone the marrow, and so on, but that prema is the innermost of all. One becomes soft and 










tender through prema. On account of this prema, Krishna became tribhanga. 



















"Prema is the rope by which you can tether God, as it were. Whenever you want to see 










Him you have merely to pull the rope. Whenever you call Him, He will appear before you. 



















"The mature stage of bhakti is bhava. When one attains it one remains speechless, thinking 










of Satchidananda. The feeling of an ordinary man can go only that far. When bhava ripens it 










becomes mahabhava. Prema is the last. You know the difference between a green mango and a 










ripe one. Unalloyed love of God is the essential thing. All else is unreal. 



















"Once Rama was pleased with the prayer of Narada and told him to ask for a boon. Narada 










prayed for pure love and said further, '0 Rama, please grant that I may not be deluded by Thy 










world-bewitching maya.' Rama said: 'That is all right. But ask for something else.' Narada replied: 'I 










don't want anything else. I pray only for pure love.' 



















HOW TO ATTAIN PURE LOVE OF GOD 



















"How can a devotee attain such love? First, the company of holy men. That awakens 










sraddha, faith in God. Then comes nishtha, single-minded devotion to the Ideal. In that stage the 










devotee does not like to hear anything but talk about God. He performs only those acts that 










please God. After nishtha comes bhakti, devotion to God; then comes bhava. Next mahabhava, 










then prema, and last of all the attainment of God Himself. Only for Isvarakotis, such as the 










Incarnations, is it possible to have mahabhava or prema. 



















"The knowledge of a worldly person, the knowledge of a devotee, and the Knowledge of an 










Incarnation are by no means of the same degree. The knowledge of a worldly person is like the 










light of an oil lamp, which shows only the inside of a room. Through such knowledge he eats and 










drinks, attends to household duties, protects his body, brings up his children, and so on. 





































"The knowledge of a devotee is like the light of the moon, which illumines objects both 










inside and outside a room. But such light does not enable him to see a distant or a very minute 










object. 



















"The Knowledge of an Incarnation of God is like the light of the sun. Through that light the 










Incarnation sees everything, inside and outside, big and small. 



















"The mind of a worldly person is, no doubt, like muddy water; but it can be made clear by a 










purifying agent. Discrimination and renunciation are the purifying agent." 



















The Master spoke to the devotees from Shibpur. 



















MASTER: "Have you any questions to ask?" 



















A DEVOTEE: "We have listened to your words." 



















THE TIME FACTOR IN SPIRITUAL PROGRESS 



















MASTER: "Yes, it is good to listen to these things. But nothing will happen except at the 










right time. What can quinine do for a fever patient when he runs a high temperature? Only when 










his temperature comes down through the use of 'fever mixture' or a purgative should quinine be 










prescribed. There are patients who get rid of their fever even without quinine. A child said to his 










mother, when he was put to bed, 'Mother, please wake me up when I feel the call of nature.' The 










mother said: 'My child, I shall not have to wake you. The urge itself will wake you.' 



















"Different kinds of people come here. 'Some come by boat with the devotees. But they do 










not enjoy spiritual talk. They keep nudging their friends and whispering: 'When shall we leave 










here? When are we going?' If the friends show no sign of getting up, they say, 'We would rather 










wait for you in the boat.' 



















"Those who have a human body for the first time need the experience of sense enjoyments. 










Spiritual consciousness is not awakened unless certain duties have been performed." 



















The Master was going to the pine-grove. With a smile he said to M., on the semicircular 










porch, "Well, what do you think of my state of mind?" 



















M. (smiling): "On the surface you are very simple, but inwardly very deep. It is extremely 










difficult to understand you." 



















MASTER (smiling): "True. It is like the cement floor of a house. People see only the outer 










surface and do not know how many materials there are under it." 



















It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Balaram and several other devotees got into a 










country boat to return to Calcutta. It was ebb-tide in the Ganges. A gentle breeze was blowing 










from the south, covering the bosom of the sacred river with ripples. 



















M. looked at the scene a long time. As the boat disappeared in the direction of Calcutta, he 










came back to the Master. 





































Sri Ramakrishna was going to the pine-grove. A beautiful, dark rain-cloud was to be seen in 










the northwest. The Master asked M.: "Do you think it will rain? Please bring my umbrella." M. 










brought the umbrella. Reaching the Panchavati, the Master said to Latu, who also accompanied 










him, "Why do you look so sickly?" 



















LATU: "I can hardly eat anything." 



















MASTER: "Is that the only reason? It is also a bad time of the year. Are you meditating too 










much? (To M.) I have a request to make of you. Please tell Baburam to stay with me a day or two 










during Rakhal 's absence. Otherwise I shall feel very unhappy." 



















M: "Yes, sir. I shall tell him." 



















Sri Ramakrishna asked M. whether he thought that Baburam was guileless. 



















Presently the Master left them, going in the direction of the pine-trees. After a few minutes 










M. and Latu, standing in the Panchavati, saw the Master coming back toward them. Behind him 










the sky was black with the rain-cloud. Its reflection in the Ganges made the water darker. The 










disciples felt that the Master was God Incarnate, a Divine Child five years old, radiant with the 










smile of innocence and purity. Around him were the sacred trees of the Panchavati under which he 










had practised spiritual discipline and had beheld visions of God. At his feet flowed the sacred river 










Ganges, the destroyer of man's sins. The presence of this God-man charged the trees, shrubs, 










flowers, plants, and temples with spiritual fervour and divine joy. 



















Sri Ramakrishna returned to his room and sat on the small couch. He began to praise a 










medicine that a certain brahmachari had prepared for him. Referring to this man, Hazra said: "He 










is now entangled in many worldly anxieties. What a shame! Look at Nabai Chaitanya of Konnagar. 










Though a householder, he has put on a red cloth." 



















MASTER: "What shall I say? I clearly see that it is God Himself who has assumed all these 










human forms. Therefore I cannot take anybody to task." 



















HAZRA: "Narendra is again involved in a lawsuit." 



















MASTER: "He doesn't believe in Sakti, the Divine Mother. If one assumes a human body, 










one must recognize Her." 



















HAZRA: "Narendra says: 'If I believed in Sakti, all would follow me. Therefore I cannot.'" 



















MASTER: "But it is not good for him to go to the extreme of denying the Divine Mother. He 










is now under Sakti's jurisdiction. Even a judge, while giving evidence in a case, comes down and 










stands in the witness-box. 



















(To M.) "Have you seen Narendra lately?" 



















M: "Not during the last few days." 



















MASTER: "See him and bring him here in a carriage. 



















(To Hazra) "Well, what is his relation to this [meaning himself]?" 





































HAZRA: "He expects help from you." 



















MASTER: "And what about Bhavanath? Would he come here so frequently if he didn't have 










good tendencies? What about Harish and Latu? They always meditate. Why is that?" 



















HAZRA: "That's right. Why should they devote all their time to meditation? It is quite a 










different thing for them to stay here to attend to your personal needs." 



















MASTER: "Possibly you are right. Perhaps others may take their place now." 



















Hazra left the room, leaving the Master alone with M. 



















MASTER: "Does what I say in the state of ecstasy attract people?" 



















M: "Oh, yes. Very much." 



















MASTER: "What do people think of me? Do they think anything in particular about me when 










they see me in that condition?" 



















M: "We feel in you a wonderful synthesis of knowledge, love, and renunciation, and on the 










surface a natural spontaneity. Many divine experiences have passed, like huge steamboats, 










through the deep of your inner consciousness; still you maintain outwardly this utter simplicity. 










Many cannot understand it, but a few are attracted by this state alone." 



















MASTER: "There is a sect of Vaishriavas known as the Ghoshpara, who describe God as the 










'Sahaja', the 'Simple One'. They say further that a man cannot recognize this 'Simple One' unless 










he too is simple. (To M.) Have I any ego?" 



















M: "Yes, sir. A little. You have kept it to preserve your body, and to enjoy divine love in the 










company of the devotees and impart spiritual knowledge to them. Further, you have kept this 










trace of ego by praying to the Divine Mother for it." 



















MASTER: "No. I have not kept it. It is God Himself who has left it in me. Can you tell me how 










I appear in the state of samadhi?" 



















M: "As you said a little while ago, you see the form of God when your mind rises to the 










'sixth plane'. When you speak after that, your mind comes down to the 'fifth plane'." 



















MASTER: "It is God who does all these things. I do not know anything." 



















M: "That is why you attract people so much. Sir, I have a question to ask. There are two 










opinions in the scriptures. According to one, Purana, Krishna is Chidatma, the Absolute, and Radha 










is ChitSakti, Its Divine Power; but according to another, Krishna Himself is Kali; the Primordial 










Energy." 



















MASTER: "This second view is held in the Devi Purana. According to it, Kali Herself has 










become Krishna; But what difference does it make? God is infinite, and infinite are the ways to 










reach Him." 





































M. remained speechless with wonder for a few moments and then said: "Oh, now I 










understand. As you say, the important thing is to climb to the roof. Our goal will be achieved if we 










can accomplish it by following any of the means-a rope or a pole." 



















MASTER: "It is through the grace of God that you have understood that. Without His grace 










doubt is never cleared up. 



















MASTER TEACHES M 



















"The important thing is somehow to cultivate devotion to God and love for Him. What is the 










use of knowing many things? It is enough to cultivate love of God by following any of the paths. 










When you have this love, you are sure to attain God. Afterwards, if it is necessary, God will explain 










everything to you and tell you about the other paths as well. It is enough for you to develop love of 










God. You have no need of many opinions and discussions. You have come to the orchard to eat 










mangoes. Enjoy them to your heart's content. You don't need to count the branches and leaves on 










the trees. It is wise to follow the attitude of Hanuman: 'I do not know the day of the week, the 










phase of the moon, or the position of the stars; I only contemplate Rama.' " 



















M: "I now desire that my activities may be much reduced and that I may devote myself 










greatly to God." 



















MASTER: "Ah! Certainly your desire will be fulfilled. But a Jnani can live unattached in the 










world." 



















M: "True, sir. But one needs special power to lead an unattached life." 



















MASTER: "That is also true. But perhaps you wanted the worldly life. Krishna had been 










enshrined in Radha's heart; but Radha wanted to sport with Him in human form. Hence all the 










episodes of Vrindavan. Now you should pray to God that your worldly duties may be reduced. And 










you will achieve the goal if you renounce mentally." 



















M: "But mental renunciation is prescribed for those who cannot give up the world 










outwardly. For superior devotees total renunciation is enjoined-both outer and inner." 



















Sri Ramakrishna was silent a few minutes and then resumed the conversation. 



















MASTER: "How did you like what I said about renunciation a little while ago?" 



















"Very much, sir." 



















"Renunciation does not mean simply dispassion for the world. It means dispassion for the 










world and also longing for God." 



















MASTER: "Tell me, what is the meaning of renunciation?" 



















MASTER: "You are right. You no doubt need money for your worldly life; but don't worry 










too much about it. The wise course is to accept what comes of its own accord. Don't take too 










much trouble to save money. Those who surrender their hearts and souls to God, those who are 










devoted to Him and have taken refuge in Him, do not worry much about money. As they earn, so 





































they spend. The money comes in one way and goes out the other. This is what the Gita describes 










as 'accepting what comes of its own accord'." 



















The Master referred to Haripada and said, "He came here the other day." 



















M: "He knows how to sing the stories of the Purana. He sings melodiously about the life of 










Prahlada and the nativity of Sri Krishna." 



















MASTER: "Is that so? That day I looked into his eyes. They had an inward look. I asked him 










whether he meditated a great deal, but he sat with his eyes cast down and didn't answer. Then I 










said to him, 'Look here, don't strain yourself too much.' " 



















It was now dusk. Sri Ramakrishna, as was usual with him during this part of the day, chanted 










the names of God and turned his mind to contemplation. Soon the moon rose in the sky. The 










temples, courtyards, and trees were bathed in its silvery light, and millions of broken moons 










played on the rippling surface of the Ganges. Rakhal and M. were with the Master in his room. 



















MASTER (to M.): "Baburam says, 'Oh, the worldly life! God forbid!' " 



















M: "His opinion is based on mere hearsay. What does he know of the world? He is a mere 



















child." 



















MASTER: "Yes, that is true. Have you noticed Niranjan? He is utterly artless." 



















M: "Yes, sir. His very appearance attracts people. How expressive his eyes are!" 



















MASTER: "Not only his eyes, but his entire person. His relatives proposed that he marry. At 










this he said, 'Why are you going to drown me?' (With a smile) Tell me this. People say that a man 










finds great pleasure in the company of his wife after the hard work of the day." 



















M: "That is no doubt true of those who think that way. (To Rakhal, with a smile) We are now 










being examined. This is a leading question." 



















Both Rakhal and M. were married. 



















MASTER (with a smile): "A mother says, 'I shall heave a sigh of relief if I can procure a 










"shade-tree" for my son. He will rest in its shade when scorched by the heat of the world.' " 



















M: "True, sir. But there are parents and parents. A father who is spiritually illumined doesn't 










give his children in marriage. If he does, his is a fine spirituality!" 



















Adhar Sen arrived from Calcutta and saluted the Master. After a few minutes, he went to 










the temple of Kali, where M. followed him. 



















A little later M. was sitting at the Bathing-Ghat on the Ganges. The flood tide had just set in. 










As he listened to the waters lapping against the bank, many pictures of Sri Ramakrishna's divine 










life flitted before his mind: the Master's deep samadhi, his constant ecstasy, his joy in the love of 










God, his untiring discourse on spiritual life, his genuine love for the devotees, and, above all, his 










childlike simplicity. Who was this man? Was it God who had embodied Himself on earth for the 










sake of His devotees? 





































Adhar and M. returned to the Master's room. Adhar had been to Chittagong, in East Bengal, 










on official duty. He was telling the Master about his visit to the Chandranath Hills and Sitakunda, 










sacred places of Chittagong. 



















ADHAR: "Near Sitakunda I visited a well where I saw fire in the water. It is always burning on 










the water with leaping tongues." 



















MASTER: "How is that possible?" 



















ADHAR: "The water contains phosphorus." 



















Presently Ram Chatterji entered the room. The Master said some kind words about him to 



















Adhar. 



















MASTER: "Ram's presence in the temple garden has relieved us of many anxieties. He 










searches out Harish, Latu, and the others at meal-time. Very often they are absorbed in meditation 










in some corner of the temple garden. It is Ram who sees that they eat at the proper time." 



















Saturday, September 6, 1884 Master at Adhar's house 



















About three o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was seated in Adhar's parlour on the 










second floor. Narendra, the Mukherji brothers, Bhavanath, M., Hazra, and other devotees were 










with the Master. 



















Arrangements were being made for Narendra to sing: While he was tuning the Tanpura, one 










of the strings snapped, and the Master exclaimed, "Oh! What have you done?" Narendra then 










tuned the drums. The Master said to him, "You are beating that drum, and I feel as if someone 










were slapping my cheek." 



















Referring to the Kirtan, Narendra said: 'There is not much rhythm in the Kirtan. That's why it 










is so popular and people love it so much." 



















MASTER: "How silly! People like it because it is so tender and full of pathos." 



















NARENDRA S MUSIC 



















Narendra sang: 



















Sweet is Thy name, a Refuge of the humble! It falls like sweetest nectar on our ears and 










comforts us, Beloved of our souls! . . . 



















He sang again: 



















Lord, must all my days pass by so utterly in vain? Down the path of hope I gaze with 










longing, day and night. Thou art the Lord of all the worlds, and I but a beggar here; how can I ask of 










Thee to come and dwell within my heart? My poor heart's humble cottage door is standing open 










wide; be gracious, Lord, and enter there but once, and quench its thirst! 



















MASTER (to Hazra, smiling): "That was the first song he sang for me." 





































Narendra sang one or two more songs. Then Vaishnavcharan sang, describing the grief of 










the gopis at the sight of Krishna as king of Mathura: 



















Hari, how shall we know You now? In Mathura's royal splendour You have forgotten us. 



















MASTER: "Won't you sing that one-'O Vina, sing Lord Hari's name?" 










Vaishnavcharan sang: 



















Vina, sing Lord Hari's name! Without the blessing of His feet You cannot know the final 










Truth. The name of Hari slays all grief: Sing Hari's name! Sing Krishna's name! If only Hari shows His 










grace, Then I shall never be distressed. Vina, sing His name but once; No earthly gem is half so 










rare. Govinda says: In vain my days have passed. No longer may I float here in life's trackless ocean 










waste! 



















While listening to the song, the Master became abstracted. Saying "Ah me! Ah me!" he 










went into samadhi. The devotees were sitting around him, their eyes riveted on him. The room 










was filled with people. 



















MASTER IN ECSTASY 



















The musician sang again. As he improvised new lines describing ecstatic love of God, the 










Master stood up and danced. He himself improvised lines and sang them with outstretched arms. 










Soon he went into samadhi and sat down, with his head resting on the bolster in front of him. 










The musician was also carried away with emotion and sang new songs. Sri Ramakrishna again 










stood up and began to dance. The devotees could not control themselves. They too danced with 










the Master. While dancing, Sri Ramakrishna every now and then went into deep samadhi. When 










he was in the deepest samadhi he could not utter a word and his whole body remained transfixed. 










The devotees danced encircling him. After a while, regaining partial consciousness, he danced with 










the strength of a lion, intoxicated with ecstatic love. But even then he could not utter a word. 










Finally, regaining more of the consciousness of the world, he sang again, improvising the lines. An 










intense spiritual atmosphere was created in Adhar's parlour. At the sound of the loud music a large 










crowd had gathered in the street. 



















Sri Ramakrishna danced a long time in the company of the devotees. When he resumed his 










seat, still tinged with the lingering glow of divine fervour, he asked Narendra to sing "0 Mother, 










make me mad with Thy love". 



















Narendra sang: 



















Mother, make me mad with Thy love! What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . . 










MASTER: "And that one— 'Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness'." 










Narendra sang: 



















Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness waves of ecstatic love arise: Rapture divine! Play of 










God's Bliss! Oh, how enthralling! . . . 





































MASTER: "And that one too— 'In Wisdom's firmament'. Perhaps it is too long. Do you think 










so? All right, sing it slowly." 



















Narendra sang: 



















In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full, And Love's flood-tide, in surging 










waves, is flowing everywhere. Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee! . . . 



















MASTER: "And won't you sing that one, The Wine of Heavenly Bliss'?" 



















Narendra sang: 



















Be drunk, mind, be drunk with the Wine of Heavenly Bliss! Roll on the ground and weep, 










chanting Hari's sweet name! Fill the arching heavens with your deep lion roar, Singing Hari's sweet 










name! With both your arms upraised, Dance in the name of Hari and give His name to all. Swim by 










day and by night in the bliss of Hari's love; Slay desire with His name, and blessed be your life! 



















The Master improvised, "Be drunk with prema and weep, chanting Hari's sweet name." 










And, "Be mad with divine fervour and weep, chanting His name." 



















Sri Ramakrishna and the devotees rested awhile. Narendra said to the Master in a low 










voice, "Will you kindly sing that one?" 



















MASTER: "My voice has become a little hoarse." 



















After a few minutes he asked Narendra, "Which one?" 



















NARENDRA: "Gaur, whose beauty delights the world." 



















Sri Ramakrishna sang, describing the beauty of Sri Chaitanya: 



















Who has brought Gaur to Nadia Gaur, whose beauty delights the world? His face, covered 










with ringlets of hair, shines like lightning against a dark cloud. . . . 



















Again he sang, this time about the grief of a Gopi at her separation from Sri Krishna: 



















I have not found my Krishna, friend! How cheerless my home without Him! Ah, if Krishna 










could only be the hair upon my head, carefully I should braid it then, and deck it with 










bakul-flowers; carefully I should fashion the braids out of my Krishna-hair. Krishna is black, and 










black is my hair; black would be one with black. Ah, if Krishna could only be the ring I wear in my 










nose, always from my nose He would hang, and my two lips could touch Him. But it can never be, 










alas! Why should I idly dream? Why should Krishna care at all to be the ring in my nose? Ah, if 










Krishna could only be the bracelets on my arms, Always He would cling to my wrists, and proudly I 










should walk, Shaking my bracelets to make them sound, shaking my arms to show them; Down the 










king's highway I should walk, wearing my Krishna bracelets. 



















The music was over. The Master began to talk with the devotees. MASTER (smiling): "Hazra 










danced." NARENDRA: "Yes, a little." MASTER: "A little?" 





































NARENDRA: "Yes. His belly danced too." (All laugh.) Pundit Shashadhar's host had been 










thinking of inviting the Master for dinner. MASTER: "I have heard that his host is not an honest 










man. He is immoral." NARENDRA: "That is why you didn't drink the water he touched. It happened 










the first day you met Shashadhar at his house. How did you come to know he was immoral?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "Hazra knows of another instance. It happened at Sihore in Hriday's 










house." HAZRA: "The man was a Vaishnava. He came with me to see you [meaning Sri 










Ramakrishna]. As soon as he sat in front of you, you turned your back on him." 



















MASTER: "We learnt later that he led an immoral life. (To Narendra) You used to say, at 










first, that these were all hallucinations." NARENDRA: "How was I to know? Now I see that you are 










always right." Adhar had prepared a feast for the Master and the devotees, and now he invited 










them to the meal. The Master said to the Mukherji brothers: "What? Won't you eat?" They said 










humbly, "Please excuse us." MASTER: "But why? You are doing everything else. Why this hesitation 










only about eating the meal?" 



















Adhar was a low-caste Hindu. Therefore some of the Master's brahmin devotees hesitated 










to eat at his house. They came to their senses at last when they saw Sri Ramakrishna himself 










eating. 



















It was about nine o'clock. The Master was resting in the drawing-room with the devotees. 










He would soon leave for Dakshineswar. The Mukherji brothers had arranged with a singer of Kirtan 










to entertain the Master the following day. Ram was taking singing lessons from this musician. Sri 










Ramakrishna asked Narendra to come to Dakshineswar to hear the Kirtan. 



















MASTER (to Narendra): "Come tomorrow, won't you?" NARENDRA: "I shall try, sir." 










MASTER: "You can bathe there and also take your meal. (Pointing to M.) He may dine there too. 










(To M.) Are you quite well now? I hope you are not on a diet." 



















M: "No, sir. I shall come." 



















Nityagopal was living at Vrindavan. Chunilal had returned from Vrindavan only a few days 










before, and the Master inquired about Nityagopal. 



















As Sri Ramakrishna was about to leave, M. saluted him, touching the Master's feet with his 










forehead. The Master said to him tenderly: "Then I shall see you tomorrow. Narendra! Bhavanath! 










Please come tomorrow." Then with several devotees he set out for Dakshineswar. 



















The other devotees returned home in the moonlit night, cherishing in their hearts the 










Master's ecstatic music and dancing. 



















AT DAKSHINESWAR 



















Sunday, September 7, 1884 



















IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK. The Master was sitting in his room at Dakshineswar. He 










had not yet taken his midday meal. 





































Arrangements had been made with the musician Shyamdas to entertain the Master and the 










devotees with his kirtan. Baburam, M., Manomohan, Bhavanath, Kishori, Chunilal, Haripada, the 










Mukherji brothers, Ram, Surendra, Tarak, Niranjan, and others arrived at the temple garden. Latu, 










Harish, and Hazra were staying with the Master. 



















When M. saluted Sri Ramakrishna, the Master asked: "Where is Narendra? Isn't he 










coming?" M. told him that Narendra could not come. 



















A brahmin devotee was reading to the Master from a book of devotional songs by 










Ramprasad. Sri Ramakrishna asked him to continue. The brahmin read a song, the first line of 










which was: "0 Mother, put on Thy clothes." 



















MASTER: "Stop, please! These ideas are outlandish and bizarre. Read something that will 










awaken bhakti." 



















The brahmin read: 



















Who is there that can understand what Mother Kali is? Even the six darsanas are powerless 










to reveal Her. . . . 



















MASTER (to M.): "I got a pain because I lay too long on one side while in samadhi yesterday 










at Adhar's house; so now I'll take Baburam with me when I visit the houses of the devotees. He is a 










sympathetic soul" 



















With these words the Master sang: 



















How shall I open my heart,0 friend? It is forbidden me to speak. I am about to die, for lack 










of a kindred soul to understand my misery. Simply by looking in his eyes, I find the beloved of my 










heart; but rare is such a soul, who swims in ecstatic bliss on the high tide of heavenly love. 



















MASTER: "The Bauls sing songs like that. They also sing another kind of song: 



















Stay your steps, wandering monk! Stand there with begging-bowl in hand, and let me 










behold your radiant face. 



















SIGNS OF A PERFECT SOUL 



















"According to the Sakti cult the siddha is called a koul, and according to the Vedanta, a 










paramahamsa. The Bauls call him a sai. They say, 'No one is greater than a sai.' The sai is a man of 










supreme perfection. He doesn't see any differentiation in the world. He wears a necklace, one half 










made of cow bones and the other of the sacred tulsi-plant. He calls the Ultimate Truth 'Alekh', the 










'Incomprehensible One'. The Vedas call It 'Brahman'. About the jivas the Bauls say, 'They come 










from Alekh and they go unto Alekh.' 



















That is to say, the individual soul has come from the Unmanifest and goes back to the 










Unmanifest. The Bauls will ask you, 'Do you know about the wind?' The 'wind' means the great 










currrent that one feels in the subtle nerves, Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna, when the Kundalini is 










awakened. They will ask you further, 'In which station are you dwelling?' According to them there 










are six 'stations', corresponding to the six psychic centres of Yoga. If they say that a man dwells in 





































the 'fifth station', it means that his mind has climbed to the fifth centre, known as the Visuddha 










chakra. (To M.) At that time he sees the Formless." 



















Saying this the Master sang: 



















Within the petals of this flower there lies concealed a subtle space, Transcending which, 










one sees at length the universe in Space dissolve. 



















DESCRIPTION OF THE BAULS 



















"Once a Baul came here. I asked him, 'Have you finished the task of "refining the syrup"? 










Have you taken the pot off the stove?' The more you boil the juice of sugarcane, the more it is 










refined. In the first stage of boiling it is simply the juice of the sugar-cane. Next it is molasses, then 










sugar, then sugar candy, and so on. As it goes on boiling, the substances you get are more and 










more refined. 



















"When does a man take the pot off the stove? That is, when does a man come to the end of 










his sadhana? He comes to the end when he has acquired complete mastery over his sense-organs. 










His sense-organs become loosened and powerless, as the leech is loosened from the body when 










you put lime on its mouth. In that state a man may live with a woman, but he does not feel any 










lust for her. 



















"Many of the Bauls follow a 'dirty' method of spiritual discipline. It is like entering a house 










through the back door by which the scavengers come. 



















"One day I was taking my meal when a Baul devotee arrived. He asked me, 'Are you yourself 










eating, or are you feeding someone else?' The meaning of his words was that the siddha sees God 










dwelling within a man. The siddhas among the Bauls will not talk to persons of another sect; they 










call them 'strangers'. 



















"The Bauls designate the state of perfection as the 'sahaja', the 'natural' state. There are 










two signs of this state. First, a perfect man will not 'smell of Krishna'. Second, he is like the bee that 










lights on the lotus but does not sip the honey. The first means, that he keeps all his spiritual 










feelings within himself. He doesn't show outwardly any sign of spirituality. He doesn't even utter 










the name of Hari. The second means that he is not attached to woman. He has completely 










mastered his senses. 



















"The Bauls do not like the worship of an image. They want a living man. That is why one of 










their sects is called the Kartabhaja. They worship the karta, that is to say, the guru, as God. 



















DIFFERENT PATHS LEADING TO GOD 



















"You see how many opinions there are about God. Each opinion is a path. There are 










innumerable opinions and innumerable paths leading to God." 



















BHAVANATH: "Then what should we do?" 



















Devotion to one's own path and respect for others' 





































MASTER: "You must stick to one path with all your strength. A man can reach the roof of a 










house by stone stairs or a ladder or a rope-ladder or a rope or even by a bamboo pole. But he 










cannot reach the roof if he sets foot now on one and now on another. He should firmly follow one 










path. Likewise, in order to realize God a man must follow one path with all his strength. 



















"But you must regard other views as so many paths leading to God. You should not feel that 










your path is the only right path and that other paths are wrong. You mustn't bear malice toward 










others. 



















"Well, to what path do I belong? Keshab Sen used to say to me: 'You belong to our path. 










You are gradually accepting the ideal of the formless God.' Shashadhar says that I belong to his 










path. Vijay, too, says that I belong to his Vijay's path." 



















THE TIDES IN THE GANGES 



















Sri Ramakrishna walked toward the Panchavati with M. and a few other devotees. It was 










midday and time for the flood-tide in the Ganges. 



















They waited in the Panchavati to see the bore of the tide. 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "The ebb-tide and flood-tide are indeed amazing. But notice one 










thing. Near the sea you see ebb-tide and flood-tide in a river, but far away from the sea the river 










flows in one direction only. What does this mean? Try to apply its significance to your spiritual life. 










Those who live very near God feel within them the currents of bhakti, bhava, and the like. In the 










case of a few— the Isvarakotis, for instance— one sees even mahabhava and prema. 



















(To M.) "What is the explanation of the ebb-tide and flood-tide?" 



















M: "According to Western astronomy, they are due to the attraction of the sun and the 










moon." 



















In order to explain it, M. drew figures on the earth and began to show the Master the 










movement of the earth, the sun, and the moon. 



















The Master looked at the figures for a minute and said: "Stop, please! It gives me a 










headache." 



















Presently the tide came up the Ganges. They heard the sound of the rushing water. The tide 










struck the bank of the river and flowed toward the north. Sri Ramakrishna looked at it intently and 










exclaimed like a child: "Look at that boat! I wonder what is going to happen to it." 



















The Master and M. sat down for a while in the Panchavati, Sri Ramakrishna placing his 










umbrella on the cement platform. The conversation turned to Narayan. The boy was a student. Sri 










Ramakrishna looked upon him as Narayana, God Himself, and was very fond of him. 



















MASTER: "Have you noticed Naran's nature? He can mix with all, old and young. One cannot 










do this without a special power. 



















Besides, all love him. Is he really artless?" 





































"I think so." MASTER: "I understand that he goes to your place. Is that so?" 



















"Yes, sir. He has visited me once or twice." MASTER: "Will you give him a rupee? Or shall I 










ask Kali about it?" 



















"Very well, sir. I shall give him the money." 



















MASTER: "That's fine. It is good to help those who yearn for God. Thus one makes good use 










of one's money. What will you gain by spending everything on your family?" 



















Kishori had several children. His salary was too small to support his family. Sri Ramakrishna 










said to M.: "Naran said he would get a job for Kishori. Please remind him of it." 



















The Master walked away in the direction of the pine-grove. Returning to the Panchavati, he 










said to M.: "Please ask someone to spread a mat outside my room. I shall lie down a few minutes. I 










am coming presently." 



















When the Master returned to his room, he could not find his umbrella and exclaimed: "You 










have all forgotten the umbrella! The busybody doesn't see a thing even when it is very near him. A 










man went to a friend's house to light the charcoal for his smoke, though all the time he had a 










lighted lantern in his hand. Another man looked everywhere for his towel. Finally he discovered 










that it had been on his shoulder all the time." 



















It was about one o'clock in the afternoon. The Master ate the prasad from the Kali temple. 










Then he wanted to rest awhile, but the devotees were still sitting in his room. They were asked to 










go out, and then the Master lay down. He said to Baburam, "Come here; sit near me." Baburam 










answered, "I am preparing betel-leaf." The Master said,"Put your betel-leaf aside" 



















The devotees sat under the bakul-tree in the Panchavati. Tarak, who had just returned from 










Vrindavan, told them stories of his visit. 



















A little later Sri Ramakrishna was seated again on his couch, the devotees sitting on the 










floor. Shyamdas was singing with his party. 



















He sang of the gopis' grief at their separation from Sri Krishna: 



















Dry as a desert seemed the happy lake to them: The chatak died of thirst, gazing toward the 



















clouds. 



















The Master became somewhat abstracted, but the musician could not create a spiritual 










atmosphere. Sri Ramakrishna asked Nabai of Konnagar to sing a kirtan. Nabai was Manomohan's 










uncle. He lived on the bank of the Ganges, devoting his time to prayer and meditation, and was a 










frequent visitor of Sri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar. 



















MASTER IN ECSTASY 



















Nabai began the kirtan in a loud voice. The Master left the couch and began to dance. 










Immediately Nabai and other devotees began to dance around him. The atmosphere became 










intense with spiritual fervour. 





































After the kirtan, Sri Ramakrishna resumed his seat. With great feeling he began to sing of 










the Divine Mother, his eyes turned upward: 



















Mother, ever blissful as Thou art, Do not deprive Thy worthless child of bliss! My mind 










knows nothing but Thy Lotus Feet. The King of Death scowls at me terribly; Tell me, Mother, what 










shall I say to him? . . . 



















He sang again: 



















As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love; As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain; 










And faith is the root of all. . . . 



















He continued: 



















This world, Mother, is Thy madhouse! What can I say of all Thy virtues? Setting aside 










Thine elephant, Thou roamest about on foot; putting off Thy gems and pearls, Self-willed 










Mother, Thou dost adorn Thy comely neck with a garland of human heads. Now Thou must rescue 










Ramprasad out of the forest of this world. 



















Again he sang: 



















Why should I go to Ganga or Gaya, to Kasi, Kanchi, or Prabhas, So long as I can breathe my 










last with Kali's name upon my lips?... 



















And again: 



















Dwell, mind, within yourself; enter no other's home. If you but seek there, you will find All 










you are searching for. . . . 



















And then: 



















The black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight to the blue lotus flower of Mother 










Syama's feet. . . . 



















And then: 



















Cherish my precious Mother Syama Tenderly within, mind; May you and I alone behold 










Her, Letting no one else intrude. . . . 



















As the Master sang this last song he stood up. He was almost intoxicated with divine love. 










Again and again he said to the devotees, 



















"Cherish my precious Mother Syama tenderly within." 



















Then he danced and sang: 



















Is Kali, my Mother, really black? The Naked One, of blackest hue, Lights the Lotus of the 










Heart 



















The Master reeled as he sang. Niranjan came forward to hold him. The Master said to him 










softly, "Don't touch me, you rascal!" 





































Seeing the Master dance, the devotees stood up. He caught hold of M.'s hand and said: 










"Don't be foolish! Dance!" 



















Sri Ramakrishna resumed his seat, still charged with divine ecstasy. Coming down a little to 










the normal state, he said: "Om! Om! Om! 



















Om! Om! Om Kali!" Again he said, "Let me have a smoke." Many of the devotees stood 










around. Mahimacharan was fanning him. The Master asked him to sit down and recite from the 










scriptures. Mahimacharan recited from the Mahanirvana Tantra: 



















Om; I bow to Thee, the Everlasting Cause of the world; I bow to Thee, Pure Consciousness, 










the Soul that sustains the whole universe. I bow to Thee, who art One without duality, who dost 










bestow liberation; I bow to Thee, Brahman, the all-pervading Attributeless Reality. Thou alone art 










the Refuge, the only Object of adoration; Thou art the only Cause of the universe, the Soul of 










everything that is; Thou alone art the world's Creator, Thou its Preserver and Destroyer; Thou art 










the immutable Supreme Lord, the Absolute; Thou art unchanging Consciousness. Dread of the 










dreadful! Terror of the terrible! Refuge of all beings! Purity of purifiers! Thou alone dost rule over 










those in the high places, Supreme over the supreme, the Protector of protectors. Almighty Lord, 










who art made manifest as the Form of all, yet art Thyself unmanifest and indestructible; Thou who 










art imperceptible to the senses, yet art the very Truth; Incomprehensible, imperishable, 










all-pervading, hidden, and without form; Lord! Light of the Universe! Protect us from harm. On 










that One alone we meditate; that One is the sole object of our worship; To That alone, the 










non-dual Witness of the Universe, we bow. In that One who alone exists and who is our sole 










eternal Support, we seek, refuge, The self-dependent Lord, the Vessel of Safety in the ocean of 










existence. 



















Sri Ramakrishna listened to the hymn with folded hands. After it was sung he saluted 










Brahman; the devotees did likewise. 



















Adhar arrived from Calcutta and bowed down before the Master. 



















MASTER (to M.): "We have had such joy today! How much joy Hari's name creates! Is it not 



















so?" 



















M: "Yes, sir." 



















Mahimacharan was a student of philosophy. That day he too had chanted the name of Hari 










and danced during the kirtan. This made the Master very happy. 



















It was about dusk. Many of the devotees took their leave. A lamp was lighted in Sri 










Ramakrishna's room and incense was burnt. 



















After some time the moon came out, flooding the sky with its light. 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on his couch. He was in a spiritual mood, absorbed in 










contemplation of the Divine Mother. Now and then he chanted Her hallowed name. Adhar was 










sitting on the floor. M. and Niranjan, too, were there. Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to Adhar. 





































MASTER: "What! You have come just now! We have had so much kirtan and dancing. 










Shyamdas began the kirtan. He is Ram's music teacher. But I didn't enjoy his singing very much; I 










didn't feel like dancing. Later I heard about his character. I was told that he had as many mistresses 










as there are hairs on a man's head. 



















"Didn't you get the job?" 



















Adhar held the post of deputy magistrate, a government post that carried with it great 










prestige. He earned three hundred rupees a month. He had applied for the office of vice-chairman 










of the Calcutta Municipality. The salary attached to this office was one thousand rupees. In order 










to secure it, Adhar had interviewed many influential people in Calcutta. 



















MASTER (to M. and Niranjan): "Hazra said to me, 'Please pray to the Divine Mother for 










Adhar, that he may secure the job.' Adhar made the same request to me. I said to the Mother: '0 










Mother, Adhar has been visiting You. May he get the job if it pleases You.' But at the same time I 










said to Her: 'How small-minded he is! He is praying to You for things like that and not for 










Knowledge and Devotion.' 



















(To Adhar) "Why did you dance attendance on all those small-minded people? You have 










seen so much; you have heard so much! 



















After reading the entire Ramayana, to ask whose wife Sita is!' " 



















ADHAR: "A man cannot but do these things if he wants to lead a householder's life. You 










haven't forbidden us to, have you?" 



















ADVICE TO ADHAR ABOUT RENUNCIATION 



















MASTER: "Nivritti alone is good, and not pravritti. Once, when I was in a God-intoxicated 










state, I was asked to go to the manager of the Kali temple to sign the receipt for my salary. They all 










do it here. But I said to the manager: 'I cannot do that. I am not asking for any salary. You may give 










it to someone else if you want.' I am the servant of God alone. Whom else shall I serve? Mallick 










noticed the late hours of my meals and arranged for a cook. He gave me one rupee for a month's 










expenses. That embarrassed me. I had to run to him whenever he sent for me. It would have been 










quite a different thing if I had gone to him of my own accord. 



















"In leading the worldly life one has to humour mean-minded people and do many such 










things. After the attainment of my exalted state, I noticed how things were around me and said to 










the Divine Mother, '0 Mother! Please change the direction of my mind right now, so that I may not 










have to flatter rich people.' 



















(To Adhar) "Be satisfied with the job you have. People hanker after a post paying fifty or a 










hundred rupees, and you are earning three hundred rupees! You are a deputy magistrate. I saw a 










deputy magistrate at Kamarpukur. His name was Ishwar Ghosha! He had a turban on his head. 










Men's very bones trembled before him. I remember having seen him during my boyhood. Is a 










deputy magistrate a person to be trifled with? 





































"Serve him whom you are already serving. The mind becomes soiled by serving but one 










master. And to serve five masters! 



















"Once a woman became attached to a Mussalman and invited him to her room. But he was 










a righteous person; he said to her that he wanted to use the toilet and must go home to get his 










water-jar for water. The woman offered him her own, but he said: 'No, that will not do. I shall use 










the jar to which I have already exposed myself. I cannot expose myself before a new one.' With 










these words he went away. That brought the woman to her senses. She understood that a new 










water-jar, in her case, signified a paramour." 



















Narendra was in straitened circumstances on account of his father's unexpected death. He 










had been seeking a job to maintain his mother, brothers, and sisters. He had served a few days as 










headmaster of the Vidyasagar School at Bowbazar. 



















ADHAR: "May I ask if Narendra would accept a job?" 



















MASTER: "Yes, he would. He has his mother, brothers, and sisters to support." 



















ADHAR: "Well, Narendra can support his family with fifty or with a hundred rupees. Will he 










try for a hundred?" 



















MASTER: "Worldly people think highly of their wealth. They feel that there is nothing like it. 










Sambhu said, 'It is my desire to leave all my property at the Lotus Feet of God.' But does God care 










for money? He wants from His devotees knowledge, devotion, discrimination, and renunciation. 



















"After the theft of the jewelry from the temple of Radhakanta, Mathur Babu said: '0 God, 










You could not protect Your own jewelry! What a shame!' Once he wanted to give me an estate and 










consulted Hriday about it. I overheard the whole thing from the Kali temple and said to him: 










'Please don't harbour any such thought. It will injure me greatly.' " 



















ADHAR: "I can tell you truthfully, sir, that not more than six or seven persons like you have 










been born since the creation of the world." 



















MASTER: "How so? There certainly are people who have given up everything for God. As 










soon as a man gives up his wealth, people come to know about him. But it is also true that there 










are others unknown to people. Are there not such holy men in upper India?" 



















ADHAR: "I know of at least one such person in Calcutta. He is Devendranath Tagore." 



















MASTER: "What did you say? Who has enjoyed the world as much as he? Once I visited him 










at his house with Mathur Babu. I saw that he had many young children. The family physician was 










there writing out prescriptions. 



















If, after having eight children, a man doesn't think of God, then who will? If, after, enjoying 










so much wealth, Devendranath hadn't thought of God, then people would have cried shame upon 










him." 



















NIRANJAN: "But he paid off all his father's debts." 





































MASTER: "Keep quiet! Don't torment me any more. Do you call anyone a man who doesn't 










payoff his father's debts if he is able to? 



















But I admit that Devendranath is infinitely greater than other worldly men, who are sunk in 










their worldliness. They can learn much from him. 



















SIGNS OF A REAL DEVOTEE 



















There is an ocean of difference between a real all-renouncing devotee of God and a 










householder devotee. A real sannyasi, a real devotee who has renounced the world, is like a bee. 










The bee will not light on anything but a flower. It will not drink anything but honey. 



















But a devotee leading the worldly life is like a fly. The fly sits on a festering sore as well as 










on a sweetmeat. One moment he enjoys a spiritual mood, and the next moment he is beside 










himself with the pleasure of 'woman and gold'. 



















"A devotee who has really and truly renounced all for God is like the chatak bird. It will drink 










only the rain-water that falls when the star Svati is in the ascendant. It will rather die of thirst than 










touch any other water, though all around there may lie seven oceans and rivers full to the brim 










with water. An all-renouncing devotee will not touch 'woman and gold'. He will not keep 'woman 










and gold' near him lest he should feel attached." 



















ADHAR: "But Chaitanya, too, enjoyed the world." 



















MASTER (amazed): "What? What did he enjoy in the world?" 



















ADHAR: "Scholarship! Honour!" 



















MASTER: "It was honour in the sight of others, but nothing to him. Whether you— a deputy 










magistrate— or this youngster Niranjan honours me, it is all the same to me. And I tell you this 










truthfully: the idea of controlling a wealthy man never enters my mind. Surendra once said, rather 










condescendingly, that RakhaTs father could sue me for letting Rakhal stay with me. When I heard 










this from Manomohan, I said: 'Who is this Surendra? How does he dare make a remark like that? 










He keeps a carpet and pillow here and gives me some money. Is that his excuse for daring to make 










such an impudent remark?' " 



















ADHAR: "I understand that he gives ten rupees a month. Isn't that so?" 



















MASTER: "That covers two months expenses. The devotees stay here and he gives the 










money for their service. It is he who earns the merit. What is that to me? Is it for my personal gain 










that I love Narendra, Rakhal, and the others?" 



















M: "Your love for them is like a mother's for her children." 



















MASTER S GENUINE LOVE FOR HIS DISCIPLES 



















MASTER: "But even behind the mother's love lies her hope that the children will support her 










later on. But I love these youngsters because I see in them Narayana Himself. These are not mere 










words. 





































GOD TAKES CHARGE OF HIS DEVOTEES 



















(To Adhar) "Listen. There is no scarcity of moths when the lamp is lighted. When God is 










realized, He Himself provides everything for His devotees. He sees that they do not lack anything. 










When God is enshrined in the heart, many people come forward to offer their services. 



















"Once a young sannyasi went to a householder to beg his food. He had lived as a monk from 










his very birth; he knew nothing of worldly matters. A young daughter of the householder came out 










to give him alms; He turned to her mother and said, 'Mother, has this girl abscesses on her chest?' 










The mother said: 'No, my child. God has given her breasts to nurse her child when she becomes a 










mother.' Thereupon the sannyasi said: 'Then why should I worry about myself? Why should I beg 










my food? He who has created me will certainly feed me.' 



















"Listen. If a woman renounces everything for her paramour, she can say to him, if need be, 










'You wretch ! I shall sit on your chest and devour you.' 



















"Nangta told me of a certain king who gave a feast to the sadhus, using plates and tumblers 










of gold. I noticed in the monasteries at Benares with what great respect the abbots were treated. 










Many wealthy up-country people stood before them with folded hands, ready to obey their 










commands. But a true sadhu, a man who has really renounced everything, seeks neither a gold 










plate nor honour. 



















God sees that he lacks nothing. God gives the devotee everything that is needed for 










realizing Him. 



















(To Adhar) "You are an executive officer. What shall I say to you? Do whatever you think 










best. I am an illiterate person." 



















ADHAR (smiling, to the devotees): "Now he is examining me." 



















MASTER (smiling) : "Dispassion alone is good. Don't you see, I didn't sign the receipt for my 










salary? God alone is real and all else is illusory." 



















Hazra entered the room and sat with the devotees on the floor. Hazra repeated now and 










then, "Soham! Soham!" "I am He! I am He!" 



















To Latu and other devotees he often said: "What does one gain by worshipping God with 










offerings? That is merely giving Him things that are His already." He had said this once to 










Narendra. 



















The Master spoke to him. 



















MASTER: "I explained to Latu who the object of the devotee's worship is." 










HAZRA: "The devotee really prays to his own Self." 



















MASTER: "What you say is a very lofty thought. The aim of spiritual discipline, of chanting 










God's name and glories, is to realize just that. A man attains everything when he discovers his true 










Self in himself. The object of sadhana is to realize that. That also is the purpose of assuming a 





































human body. One needs the clay mould as long as the gold image has not been cast; but when the 










image is made, the mould is thrown away. The body may be given up after the realization of God. 



















"God is not only inside us; He is both inside and outside. The Divine Mother showed me in 










the Kali temple that everything is Chinmaya, the Embodiment of Spirit; that it is She who has 










become all this— the image, myself, the utensils of worship, the door-sill, the marble floor. 










Everything is indeed Chinmaya. 



















"The aim of prayer, of spiritual discipline, of chanting the name and glories of God, is to 










realize just that. For that alone a devotee loves God. These youngsters are on a lower level; they 










haven't yet reached a high spiritual state. They are following the path of bhakti. Please don't tell 










them such things as 'I am He'." 



















Like the mother bird brooding over her chicks, Sri Ramakrishna was alert to protect his 










devotees. 



















Adhar and Niranjan went out on the porch to take refreshments. Presently they returned to 










the room. 



















ADHAR (smiling): "We talked about so many things. (Pointing to M.) But he didn't utter a 



















word." 



















MASTER: "In Keshab's organization there was a young man with four university degrees. He 










laughed when he saw people arguing with me. He said: 'To argue with him! How silly!' I saw him 










again, later on, at one of Keshab's meetings. But then he did not have the same bright 










complexion." 



















Sri Ramakrishna sat on the floor for his supper. It was a light meal of a little farina pudding 










and one or two luchis that had been offered in the Kali temple. M. and Latu were in the room. The 










devotees had brought various sweets for the Master. He touched a sandesh and asked Latu, "Who 










is the rascal that brought this?" He took it out of the cup and left it on the ground. He said to Latu 










and M.: "I know all about him. He is immoral" 



















LATU: "Shall I give you this sweet?" 



















MASTER: "Kishori brought it." 



















LATU: "Will it suit you?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "Yes." 



















M. had received an English education. Sri Ramakrishna said to him: "It is not possible for me 










to eat things offered by anyone and everyone. Do you believe this?" 



















M: "Gradually I shall have to believe all these things." 



















MASTER: "Yes, that is so." 



















After finishing the meal Sri Ramakrishna washed his mouth. He said to M., "Then will you 










give the rupee to Naran?" "Yes," said M., "certainly I will." 





































The moon rose in the clear autumn sky and was reflected in the river. It was ebb-tide in the 










Ganges and the river flowed south toward the sea. 



















Sunday, September 14, 1884 



















Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room with Narendra, Bhavanath, the Mukherji brothers, 










and other devotees. Rakhal was staying with Balaram at Vrindavan and was laid up with an attack 










of fever. Narendra was preparing himself for his coming law examination. 



















About eleven o'clock Jnan Babu arrived. He was a government official and had received four 










university degrees. 



















MASTER (at the sight of Jnan Babu): "Well! Well! This sudden awakening of 'knowledge'!" 



















JNAN (smiling): "You must admit, sir, that one sees the awakening of knowledge as a result 










of very good fortune." 



















MASTER (smiling): "You are Jnan. Then why should you have ajnan, ignorance? Oh, I 










understand. Where there is knowledge there is also ignorance. The sage Vasishtha was endowed 










with great knowledge and still he wept at the death of his sons. Therefore I ask you to go beyond 










both knowledge and ignorance. The thorn of ignorance has pierced the sole of a man's foot. He 










needs the thorn of knowledge to take it out. Afterwards he throws away both thorns. The Jnani 










says, 'This world is a "framework of illusion".' But he who is beyond both knowledge and ignorance 










describes it as a 'mansion of mirth'. He sees that it is God Himself who has become the universe, all 










living beings, and the twenty-four cosmic principles. 



















LIVING IN THE WORLD AFTER REALIZATION OF GOD 



















"A man can live in the world after attaining God. Then he can lead the life of detachment. In 










the country I have seen the women of the carpenter families making flattened rice with a 










husking-machine. With one hand one of them turns the paddy in the hole and with the other she 










holds a nursing child. At the same time she talks with the buyer. She says to him: 'You owe me two 










annas. Pay it before you go.' But seventy-five per cent of the woman's mind is on her hand lest it 










should be crushed by the pestle of the husking machine. 



















"A man should do his worldly duties with only twenty-five percent of his mind, devoting the 










rest to God." 



















Referring to Pundit Shashadhar, the Master said to the devotees, "I found him 










monotonous— engaged in the dry discussion of philosophy. 



















"He alone who, after reaching the Nitya, the Absolute, can dwell in the Lila, the Relative, 










and again climb from the Lila to the Nitya, has ripe knowledge and devotion. Sages like Narada 










cherished love of God after attaining the Knowledge of Brahman. This is called vijnana. 



















"Mere dry knowledge is like an ordinary rocket: it bursts into a few sparks and then dies 










out. But the Knowledge of sages like Narada and Sukadeva is like a good rocket: for a while it 










showers balls of different colours, and then it stops; again it throws out new balls, and again it 





































stops; and thus it goes on. Those sages had prema for God. Prema is the rope by which one can 










reach Satchidananda." 



















The Master finished his midday meal and rested a few minutes. Bhavanath, M., the 










Mukherji brothers, Hazra, and several other devotees sat down under the bakul-tree and began to 










converse. The Master stopped there awhile on his way to the pine-grove. 



















HAZRA (to the younger Gopal): "Please prepare a smoke for him [meaning the Master]." 



















MASTER (smiling): "Why don't you admit that you want it?" (All laugh.) 



















MUKHERJI (to Hazra): "You must have learnt much wisdom from him [meaning the 










Master]." 



















MASTER (smiling): "No, he has been wise like this from his boyhood." (All laugh.) 



















Presently Sri Ramakrishna returned from the pine-grove. The devotees noticed that he was 










in an ecstatic mood and was reeling like a drunkard. After reaching his room he regained the 










normal state. 



















Many devotees gathered in the room. Among them was a new-comer, a sadhaka from 










Konnagar, who looked over fifty years of age and seemed to have great vanity of scholarship. 



















The Master stood in the middle of the room and suddenly said to M., "He came 










here— Naran." 



















Narendra was engaged in a discussion with Hazra and a few others on the verandah. They 










could be heard from the room. 



















MASTER (referring to Narendra): "The chatterbox! But he is now much worried about his 










family." 



















M.: "Yes, sir, it is true." 



















MASTER: "Once he said that he would look upon adversity as his good fortune. Isn't that 



















so?" 



















M: "He has great strength of mind." 



















A DEVOTEE: "Does he lack strength in anything?" 



















Pointing to the sadhaka from Konnagar, a devotee said to the Master: "Sir, he has come to 










visit you. He has some questions to ask." 



















The sadhaka was seated erect, his chin up. 



















SADHAKA: "Sir, what is the way?" 



















MASTER: "Faith in the guru's words. One attains God by following the guru's instructions 










step by step. It is like reaching an object by following the trail of a thread." 



















SADHAKA: "Is it possible to see God?" 





































MASTER: "He is unknowable by the mind engrossed in worldliness. One cannot attain God if 










one has even a trace of attachment to 'woman and gold'. But He is knowable by the pure mind and 










the pure intelligence— the mind and intelligence that have not the slightest trace of attachment. 










Pure Mind, Pure Intelligence, Pure Atman are one and the same thing." 



















SADHAKA: "But the scriptures say, 'From Him words and mind return baffled.' He is 










unknowable by mind and words." 



















MASTER: "Oh, stop! One cannot understand the meaning of the scriptures without 










practising spiritual discipline. What will you gain by merely uttering the word 'siddhi'? The pundits 










glibly quote the scriptures; but what will that accomplish? A man does not become intoxicated 










even by rubbing siddhi on his body; he must swallow it. What is the use of merely repeating, 










'There is butter in the milk'? Turn the milk into curd and churn it. Only then will you get butter." 



















SADHAKA: "You talk about churning butter. But you too are quoting the scriptures." 



















MASTER: "What will one gain by merely quoting or hearing the scriptures? One must 










assimilate them. The almanac makes a forecast of the rainfall for the year, but you won't get a 










drop by squeezing its pages." 



















SADHAKA: "You talk about churning butter. Have you done it yourself?" 



















MASTER: "You don't have to bother about what I have or haven't done. Besides, it is very 










difficult to explain these things to others. 



















Suppose someone asks you, 'What does ghee taste like?' Your answer will be, 'Ghee tastes 










like ghee.' 



















"To understand these things one needs to live with holy men, just as to understand the 










pulse of bile, of phlegm, and so on, one needs to live with a physician." 



















SADHAKA: "There are some people who are irritated by others' company." 



















MASTER: "That happens only after the attainment of Knowledge, after the realization of 










God. Shouldn't a beginner live in the company of holy men?" 



















The sadhaka sat in silence a few moments. Then he said with some irritation: "Please tell 










me whether you have realized God either directly or intuitively. You may answer me if you are 










able, or you may keep silent if you wish." The Master said with a smile: "What shall I say? One can 










only give a hint." 



















SADHAKA: "Then tell us that much." 



















Narendra was going to sing. He said, "No one has brought a pakhoaj." 



















THE YOUNGER GOPAL: "Mahimacharan has one." 



















MASTER (interrupting): "No, we don't want anything of his here." 





































A devotee from Konnagar sang a song. Every now and then Sri Ramakrishna glanced at the 










sadhaka. The singer and Narendra became engaged in a furious discussion about musical 










technique. The sadhaka said to the singer, "What is the use of such discussions?" Referring to 










another man who had joined in the discussion, Sri Ramakrishna said to the sadhaka, "Why didn't 










you scold him, too?" It could be seen that the sadhaka was not on friendly terms with his 










companions from Konnagar. 



















Narendra sang: 



















Lord, must all my days pass by so utterly in vain? Down the path of hope I gaze with 










longing, day and night. . . . 



















The sadhaka closed his eyes in meditation as he listened to the song. It was four o'clock in 










the afternoon. The rays of the setting sun fell on his body. Sri Ramakrishna quickly opened an 










umbrella and placed it near the door so that the sun might not disturb the sadhaka. 



















Narendra sang again: 



















How shall I call on Thee, Lord, with such a stained and worldly mind? Can a straw remain 










unharmed, cast in a pit of Raming coals? Thou, all goodness, art the fire, and I, all sin, am but a 










straw: How shall I ever worship Thee? The glory of Thy name, they say, redeems those even past 










redeeming; yet, when I chant Thy sacred name, alas! My poor heart quakes with fright. I spend my 










life a slave to sin; how can I find a refuge, then, Lord, within Thy holy way? In Thine abounding 










kindliness, rescue Thou this sinful wretch; Drag me off by the hair of my head and give me shelter 










at Thy feet. 



















Again he sang: 



















Sweet is Thy name, Refuge of the humble! It falls like sweetest nectar on our ears and 










comforts us, Beloved of our souls! The priceless treasure of Thy name alone is the abode of 










Immortality, and he who chants Thy name becomes immortal. Falling upon our ears, Thy holy 










name instantly slays the anguish of our hearts, Thou Soul of our souls, and fills our hearts with 










bliss! 



















As Narendra sang the line, "And he who chants Thy name becomes immortal", the Master 










went into samadhi. At first his fingers, especially the thumbs, began to tremble. The devotees from 










Kannagar had never seen the Master in samadhi. Seeing him silent, they were about to leave the 










room. Bhavanath said to them: "Why are you going away? This is his samadhi." The devotees 










resumed their places. 



















Narendra sang: 



















1 have laboured day and night to make Thy seat within my heart; Wilt Thou not be kind to 










me, Lord of the World, and enter there? 



















Sri Ramakrishna, still in the ecstatic mood, came dawn from his couch to the floor and sat 










by Narendra. The beloved disciple sang again: 





































In Wisdom's firmament the moon of Love is rising full, And Love's flood-tide, in surging 










waves, is flowing everywhere. Lord, how full of bliss Thou art! Victory unto Thee! . . . 



















As Narendra sang the last line, Sri Ramakrishna stood up, still absorbed in samadhi. 



















FUTILITY OF MERE STUDY OF SCRIPTURES 



















After a long time the Master regained partial consciousness of the world and sat down on 










the mat. Narendra finished his singing, and the Tanpura was put back in its place. The Master was 










still in a spiritual mood and said: "Mother, tell me what this is. They want someone to extract the 










butter for them and hold it to their mouths. They won't throw the spiced bait into the lake. They 










won't even hold the fishing-rod. Someone must catch the fish and put it into their hands! How 










troublesome! Mother, I won't listen to any more argument. 



















The rogues force it on me. What a bother! I shall shake it off. God is beyond the Vedas and 










their injunctions. Can one realize Him by studying the scriptures, the Vedas, and the Vedanta? (To 










Narendra) Do you understand this? The Vedas give only a hint" 



















Narendra wanted the Tanpura again. The Master said, "I want to sing." He was still in an 










ecstatic mood and sang: 



















Mother, this is the grief that sorely grieves my heart, that even with Thee for Mother, and 










though I am wide awake, There should be robbery in my house. . . 



















The Master said, "Mother, why do You make me argue?" He sang again: 



















Once for all, this time, I have thoroughly understood; From One who knows it well, I have 










learnt the secret of bhava... 



















The Master said, "I am quite conscious." But he was still groggy with divine fervour. He sang 










once more: 



















I drink no ordinary wine, but Wine of Everlasting Bliss, As I repeat my Mother Kali's name; It 










so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk!... 



















FUTILITY OF REASONING 



















Sri Ramakrishna had said, "Mother, I won't listen to any more argument." 



















Narendra sang: 



















Mother, make me mad with Thy love! What need have I of knowledge or reason? . . . 



















Sri Ramakrishna said with a smile: "0 Mother, make me mad! God cannot be realized 










through knowledge and reasoning, through the arguments in the scriptures." He had been pleased 










with the singing of the musician from Konnagar and said to him humbly: "Please sing about the 










Divine Mother. Please - one song." 



















MUSICIAN: "You must excuse me, sir." 



















MASTER (bowing with folded hands): "No, sir. I can enforce this demand." 





































Saying this, Sri Ramakrishna sang a few lines from a kirtan, assuming the attitude of a gopi: 



















Radha has every right to say it; She has kept awake for Krishna. She has stayed awake all 










night, and she has every right to be piqued. 



















Then he said to the musician: "My dear sir, you are a child of the Divine Mother. She dwells 










in all beings. Therefore I have every right to enforce my demand. A farmer said to his guru, 'I shall 










get my mantra from you by beating you, if I have to.' " 



















MUSICIAN (smiling): "By a shoe-beating?" 



















MASTER (smiling): "No! I won't go that far." Again in an abstracted mood Sri Ramakrishna 










said: "The beginner, the struggling, the perfect, and the supremely perfect. Which are 










you— perfect or supremely perfect? Come along! Sing for us." The musician complied. He sang just 










a melody. 



















MASTER: "My dear sir, that too makes me happy." The musician then sang a song. When 










the music was over, the devotees from Konnagar saluted the Master and took their leave. 



















The sadhaka bowed before him with folded hands and said, "Holy man, let me say good- 










bye." Sri Ramakrishna, still in an ecstatic mood, was talking to the Divine Mother. MASTER: 










"Mother, is it You or I? Do I do anything? No. no! It is You. 



















Was it You who heard the arguments all this time, or was it I? No, not I. It was You.". Sri 










Ramakrishna became conscious of the outer world and began to converse with Narendra, 










Bhavanath, and the other devotees. 



















They were talking about the sadhaka. 



















BHAVANATH (smiling): "What kind of man is he?" 



















MASTER: "He is a tamasic devotee." 



















BHAVANATH: "He can certainly recite Sanskrit verses." 



















MASTER: "Once I said to a man about a sadhu: 'He is a rajasic sadhu. Why should one give 










him food and other presents?' At this another sadhu taught me a lesson by saying to me: 'Don't 










say that. There are three classes of holy men: sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic' Since that day I have 










respected holy men of all classes." 



















NARENDRA (smiling): "What? Is it like the 'elephant God'? All, indeed, are God." 



















MASTER (smiling): "It is God Himself who sports in the world as both vidya and avidya. 










Therefore I salute both. It is written in the Chandi: 'The Divine Mother is the good fortune of the 










blessed and the ill fortune of the unlucky.' (To Bhavanath) Is that mentioned in the Vishnu 










Purana?" 



















BHAVANATH (smiling): "I don't know, sir. The devotees from Konnagar did not understand 










your samadhi and were about to leave the room." 





































MASTER: "Who was it that asked them to remain?" 





































BHAVANATH (smiling): "It was I." 



















MASTER: "My child, you are equally good in bringing people here and in driving them 



















away." 



















The conversation turned to the argument that Narendra had had with the musician from 










Konnagar. 



















MUKHERJI: "Narendra didn't spare him." 



















MASTER: "That's right. One needs such grit. This is called the influence of tamas on sattva. 










Must a man listen to everything another man says? Should one say to a prostitute, 'All right, you 










may do whatever you like'? Must one listen to her? At one time Radha was piqued. A friend said, 










'Her ego has been roused.' Brinde, another friend, said: 'Whose is this' ego? Her ego belongs to 










Krishna alone. She is proud in the pride of Krishna.' " 



















GLORY OF GOD'S NAME 



















The conversation turned to the glory of God's name. BHAVANATH: "I feel such relief while 










chanting the name of Hari." 



















MASTER: "He who relieves us of sin is Hari. He relieves us of our three afflictions in the 










world. Chaitanya preached the glory of Hari's name; so it must be good. You see, he was such a 










great scholar, and an Incarnation too. Since he preached that name, it must be good. (Smiling) 










Once some peasants were invited to a feast. They were asked if they would eat a preparation of 










hog plum. They answered: 'You may give it to us if the gentlemen have eaten it. If they enjoyed it, 










then it must be good.' (All laugh.) 



















(To the Mukherji brothers) "I should like to visit Shivanath; I won't have to hire a carriage if 










you take me in yours." 



















MUKHERJI: "All right, sir, we shall set a day." 



















MASTER (to the devotees): "Do you think the Brahmos will like me? They criticize those who 










believe in God with form." 



















Mahendra Mukherji wanted to go on a pilgrimage. He told Sri Ramakrishna so. 



















MASTER (smiling): "How is that? Do you want to go when the sprout of divine love has 










hardly corne up? First comes the sprout, then the tree, then the fruit. We are so happy to have you 










here to talk to." 



















MAHENDRA: "I feel like visiting the holy places a little. I shall return soon." 



















It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna left his room. The devotees were 










walking in the garden. Many of them were about to leave. 





































The Master was conversing with Hazra on the north verandah. They were talking of 










Narendra's frequent visits to Annada, the eldest son of the Guhas. 



















HAZRA: "I hear that Annada is now practising austerity. He lives on very little food and eats 










rice once every four days." 



















MASTER: "Is that so? 'Who knows? One may realize God even by means of a religious 



















garb.'" 



















HAZRA: "Narendra sang the Agamani." 



















MASTER (eagerly): "How did he sing it?" 



















Kishori stood close by. The Master said to him, "Are you well?" 



















A little later the Master was standing on the west porch. Since it was autumn, he had put on 










a flannel shirt dyed with ochre. He asked Narendra, "Is it true that you sang the Agamani?" 



















Accompanied by Narendra and M., Sri Ramakrishna walked to the embankment of the 










Ganges. 



















Narendra sang the Agamani: 



















Tell me, my Uma, how have you fared, alone in the Stranger's house? People speak so much 










ill of us! Alas, I die of shame! My Son-in-law smears His body with ashes from the funeral pyre and 










roams about in great delight; You too, along with Him, cover with ash your golden skin. He begs 










the food that He eats! How can I bear it, being your mother? This time, when He returns to claim 










you, I shall say to Him, "My daughter Uma is not at home." 



















Sri Ramakrishna stood listening to the song and went into samadhi. The sun was still above 










the horizon as the Master stood on the embankment in the ecstatic mood. On one side of him was 










the Ganges, flowing north with the flood-tide. Behind him was the flower garden. To his right one 










could see the nahabat and the Panchavati. Narendra stood by his side and sang. Gradually the 










darkness of evening fell upon the earth. 



















After Narendra and several other devotees had

ABSTRACT 

In discussing the views of leading linguistics on the 
specific features of Slavic negation, the author reviews mainly Czech 
material and compares it with Russian and English works. This paper 
is part of a larger work on negation in which it is argued that a 
language system is a dynamic system based on oppositions (with 
predominant binary oppositions) where negation is latently present in 
weighing distinctions and discerning essentials from unessentials 
(i.e., in the lexical system, in denoting concepts) and before 
uttering judgments (i.e., in syntax). The theories of the following 
linguists are discussed in the present work: (1) van Ginneken, (2) ^ 
Gebauer, (3) Travnicek, (U) Jespersen, (5) Mathesius, (6) Vachek, and 
(7) Skalicka, Otto Jespersen*s "Negation in English and Other 
Languages," which explains a fluctuation in the development of 
negative expressions, is treated in some detail. The author gives 
recommendations for needed research on the semantics of the lexical 
system. The bibliography includes works consulted in the author^s 
larger work but not cited here. (PH)

SOME IMPORTANT STUDIES OF 
NHGATION IN SLAVIC LANGUAGES 
A SURVEY 



by ^. Wfc,;^ Y 



Irina A. Evreinov 



0. Introduction , My purpose in this paper is to 
draw attention to some hitherto unsolved problems of negation, 
especially in the Slavic languages. I do not claim to 
exhaust the theme. My aim is to present the most relevant 
views in linguistic literature on the subject and to out- 
^line the direction in which further research could be con- 
ducted. 

Present-day linguistics tries, on one hand, to 
describe linguistic phenomena as exhaustively as possible, 
and on the other hand, to embrace its subject as widely as 
possible by considering the reflection of extra - 1 inguist ic 
facts (e.g<, psychological, sociological) in language with 
the ultimate aim of revealing universal features common to 
all languages. 

Negation is a linguistic phenomenon which requires 
a double approach; meticulous description, on the one hand, 
^^p* and a consideration of extra-linguistic reality as reflected 
in natural languages, on the other. 

Some linguistic phenomena intersect several 
linguistic levels and cannot be described in isolation. One 
of these is negation which> being first of all a philosophi- 
cal category, is reflected in natural languages on the 
lexico-s emant ic as well as on the syntactic level in a very 
curious way. The formal means of its expression are different 
even in related Indo-European languages. But what has 




'46- 



bothered linguists and philosophers alike is the fact that 

lan^uajie seems sometimes to go against logic as, for example, 

in the case of the double or cumulative negation in Slavic 
languages. As Jespersen (1917) said: 

When logicians insist that "two negatives make an 
affirmative'* their rule is not corroborated by actual 
usage in most languages. But it would be wrong to 
divide languages into some that follow this rule and 
others that do not, for on closer inspection we find 
that in spite of great differences between languages 
in this respect there are certain underlying principles 
[my italics - I.E.) that hold good for all languages, 
fp. 62] 

I cannot in this brief paper outline the views of 
philosophers and logicians on negation (although there has 
been far more written by them on this topic than by lin- 
guists) but, as nearly all linguistic studies on negation 
were based on (or argued in terms of) logic, I shall have to 
introduce the main notions. ^ 

The main function of negation in formal logic is 
SgBjIi^iSjigD of a certain content (A : Non-A) which is 
valid only for propositions (judgments); the second function 
^5 S9fii£8£itl^» setting up of a contrary notion (A : B) 

which is valid for concepts.^ Contradiction excludes all 
that is not A, (i.e., including B as well, without speci* 
fying it). Contrariety (A : B) is a special case of contra- 
diction where the negation is "polarized** at opposing poles. 
Thus formal logic is based on the law of the excluded 
middle. It does not allow for vague terms or borderline 
cases which are inherent in language. (Modern logic attempts 
to find new methods for analyzing systems with inherent 
vagueness to build up a new concept of negation, cf, Russell, 
1923; Black, 1949; KubiAski, I95fi, 1960; Tondl, 1966; 
Neustupny > 1966. ) ^ 

Most linguistic descriptions of negation are 
based on these tw^o oppositions: contradictory, the so- 
. called ''nexal" or "sentence" negation, and contrary, the so- 

ERIC 



*47- 



called "special or ''partiar' i\e^atioii. (Cf. Gehauer, 1929; 
Jcsperson, 1917, 1924; Travni^ck. 193?; PeUovsliij, 19S6; 
Saxmatov, 19S2 e.a.) Incidentally, tlie notion of ^'noxal" 
and ''special" negation has been one of the most discussed 
problems in Slavic linguistics and is of paramount impor- 
tance for the Russian language. And now, in modern struc- 
tural linguistics", these problems are being taken up again. 

At this point 1 would like to state ar premise. 
To my mind, logic is not at fault for finding "illogicalities" 
in language, nor is language to blame for not having a 
"logical" formalized means of expression. The roots of this 
misunderstanding are, fiist of all, methodological: an 
extrapolation of scientific methods from one field to another, 
alien field; secondly, linguistic: a certain asymmetry of 
the language system ~ on one hand, the inherent redundancy 
of language (variability of terms for one specific notion), 
on the other hand, the inherent vagueness of language (lack 
of one clearly defined unambiguous term for one specific 
function). And that is, in fact what logic would need, 
should it interpret language with its own methods. Hence 
the understandable attempt of modern linguistics to find a 
formalized metalanguage for analytic as well as synthetic 
(or generative) purposes which, however, leads to oversimpli- 
fication and neglect of semantic facts. 

1. Toward a history of the problem . In discussing 
the views of leading linguists (traditional and structural) 
on the specific features of Slavic negation I shall review 
mainly Czech material, because this problem has been discussed 
at length in Czech linguistic literature, and I will compare 
it with Russian and English works. 

When we speak about "double" or "cumulative" 
negation in'Slavic languages, we should define more precise- 
ly what we have in mind. In all Indo- Huropcan (and also non- 
Indo-European, cf. Bach. 1968, p. 98, f n . S) , the rule of 
logic is valid, i.e., a double negation of the same term is 
mutually destructive, e.g., not un common = common , njj^f^t 
^un erf roul ich = er frcul ich » pas impossible = possible ,

i^^^n^ortails « m ortal is , etc. The same is true in Slavic 
languages, e.g., ru? he 2] nteresnyj - int eresny j , ne bez- 
vy z namn y « vy znamy , etc. Thus the Slavic negation does not 
•^behave illogically" in these cases. The illogical behavior 
is restricted only - and that should be stressed ~ to sen- 
tences with quantifiers or, strictly speaking, indefinite 
pronouns and adv^^rbs which, by a rule of "negation concord" 
(term used by V, Mathesius, 1937, p. 81) must become negative 
pronouns (or adverbs) in a sentence with negated verb- 
predicate • 

When we look at modern Indo-European languages we 
can observe variations in the exj^ression of negation in 
sentences with quantifiers: 

Lat: N£I!10 scit ( aliquid ) 
Germ.: Nicmand w ei3 ( etwas ) 
Eng,: Nobody knows ( anyth i ng ) 
Russ.: Nikto ne znaet ( ni^ego ) 
Cz,: NikdQ nevi (nic) 
Sb . : Niko nezna ( nlsta ) 
Pol.: Nikt n^i^e vie ( nic ) 
Fr. : Personne ne salt rien 

This is a very simplified scheme which may, how- 
evej', serve as a point of departure. The different ways of 
expression either with one negative element (associated only 
with the quantifier) or with two or more negatives (associated 
with the quant if ier(s) as well as with the verb) has attract- 
ed the attention of many linguists and given rise to differ- 
ent explanations of this phenomenon. 

1.1 van Ginn eken . J. van Ginneken (1907) tried 
to explain cumulative negation in some languages as an 
expression of a feeling of resistance. He maintains that 
the logical or mathematical concept of negation, according 
to which two negatives are mMtually destructive, has only 
gained ground in a few centers of civilization and has never 
^♦•**uck root in the popular mind:

L'adhesion negative logiquc ou matliemat ique (dont 
deux so cornpensent) est Icur signification figurce, 
nee seulcment dans queJqucs centres dc civilisation 
isol^s; jamais et nulle part elle n'a \)cn6tr(f dans le 
domaine populairc. [p. 200] 

So that, according to him, Latin, Hnglish, German use the 
"logical" way of expressing negation and the Slavic languages 
the expressive way. 

1.2 Gebauer. J. Gebauer (1883, 1885) who, 
incidentally, originated this discussion, set up his own 
theory of '^qualitative*' and "quantitative" negation. In his 
Historical Grammar (192?) he gives a functional and histori- 
cal explanation of Old Czech and Slf.vic negation (in the 
framework of Indo-European comparative linguistics)* 

Old Czech and other Slavic Languages had two 
negative particles ne and ru which differed in their 
f unct ions : 

1) ne (Skr. na. Old Russian ne, Lat. ne, Gr. ine 
(ou) < I.E. *ne (diphthongized as nei , zero grade 

2)). 

which negated, according to Gebauer, the gyalit^ (not the 
quantity!) either, a) of single words, e.g., ne?t 'astny 
'unhappy', or, b) of verbal predicates, e.g., neprsi '[it's) 
not raining'. The particle nc_ excludes, according to him, 
a notion from a given quality "p" thus creating contradiction. 
However, the same formal means (ne) might express a contrary 
notion^ e.g., pritel - nepritel 'friend - enemy'. 

2) nj, (Skr, lU, Old Russian ru, Lat. ni < I.E. 
* nei ( < ne + deictic particle £)) , 

which negated the gy§QiiJ]f> e.g., Old Czech nijeden (arch.) 
'not one*, nikdo 'nobody', tUc 'nothing', etc. 

These two negatives, continues Gebauer, do not 
destroy each other because they belong to different , dis- 
parate notions which do not overlap. Therefore, there is no 
"illogicality'' in Slavic double and cumulative negation 
(e.g., nikdo rue takov^ho nikd y ncrikal [nobody never said 



nothing like this] 'nohody ever said anything like this'), 
The author traces the historical development in 
Old Csech. There existed three ways of negating sentences 
with quantifiers; 

Typo I: i kt 0 nevic 'somebody doesn't know' or 

'nobody knows' - qualitative negation, negated 
verb; 

Type II: nikt o vie 'nobody knows' - quantitative 
negation, negated quantifier in NP; 
(incidentally, Type II is older than Type I), These two 
types of negation are common in all Indo-European languages. 
But the Slavic languages developed a third type: 

Type III: nikto nevic 'nobody knows'. 
According to Gebauer this was done to emphasize negation, 
and it ousted Type I, which was ambiguous. He shows the 
ambiguity in another example: vse neby lo at raceno could 
actually mean 1) 'nothing was lost*; 2) 'not everything 
was lost' meaning 'something was left'. {This example was 
often taken up in later discussions*) 

^•^ T'y^vnijfek . Another Czech linguist, Travnicek 
(1955), continuing Gebauer's argument, agrees in principle 
on the two main functions of negation, but considers the 
terms "qualitative" and "quantitative" inadequate because 
quantity and quality sometimes overlap (cf. Russell (1923, 
p. 88) for a discussion of the terms red and bald in this 
respect). Any sentence negation is qualitative, if it comes 
to that, says Tr^vn/ifek, e/en if expressed by negative pro- 
nouns with ru (i.e.. Old Czech Type II, nikto vie ) . 
Therefore, Tr5vn{{?ek introduces the terms "sentence negation" 
and "partial negation" limiting the latter to a C§OjJ§r^ 
function only, as in p^i tel - nepr itel . Tr^vnii?ek considers 
the need to eliminate the ambiguity of Gobauer's Type I the 
main reason for the Slavic development. His explanation is 
thus purely functional. It does not distinguish between 
"partial negat ion," that is, negation of a constituent of a 
sentence, from what I would call lexical negation by prefixa-

2. Jespersen . The most exhaustive study of 
negation in the light of comparative linguistics was made 
by 0. Jespersen in his monograph Negation in English and 
Other Lan^^uages (1917) and in Philoso phy of Grammar ( 1924), 
It is interesting to note that, even though he applied 
traditional methods, Jespersen came very close to the modern 
theory of vagueness in his consideration of borderline 
cases of linguistic units. In his view it is inconsistent 
to apply the logician's distinction between contradictory 
terms (e.g., white - not^ white, i.e., anything else but 
white) and contrary terms (e.g., white - black ) to language. 
He maintains that, 'language is not mathematics [1924, 
p. 3511,^' and further that, "language has a logic of its own 
and in this case its logic has something to recommend it 
[1924» p. 332)." Therefore, according to him for language 
as used in ordinary speech a JriB§rij|i8Q should be set up: 

A. Positive 

B. Questionable 

C. Negative. 

A and C are absolute; B implies uncertainty and in that 
respect constitutes a counterpart for both A ggjj C. 
Jespersen classifies the indefinite pronouns according to his 
"tripartition-theory" and shows that by negating the A-class 
we get the B-class, which is the same result we get by 
negating the C-class: 

Neg A « B: They are uQt ill of them fools means 
*§85SIJ8^3^ is intelligent^' 

Neg C = B: H j§ ggj gggd for a man to have Qg gods 
means 'It jg good to have sggg gods*. 
Jespersen applies his theory also to modals: 

A. Necessity ( must ) 

B. Possibility ( can , may ) 

C. Impossibilitynf cannot ) 



and shows that it works in the same way (e.g., not necessarily 



-52- 



means 'possible'; not impossible means 'possible'). 

I would like to point out here that in the case 
of mpdals language does not disagree with formal logic, 
where a double negation of one modal symbol gives the affir- 
mation of the other. Furthermore, modals overlap in their 
semantic fields. In Russian, aspect can disambiguate negated 
modals. For example. On mo^et ne pri j ti 'Perhaps he won't 
come' and On mo?et ne pr ixodit^ 'He needn't come*, 
whereas double negation neutralizes this distinction: 
On ne mozet ne prlj tl (p rixodit ' ) 'He most certainly must 
come' (with only the aspectual differentiation). 

Jespersen's aim in Negation in English and Other 
Languages (1917) is to reveal general, universal tendencies 
in the development of negation in Indo-European languages 
which lead to different results in each specific language. 
By comparing several Indo-European languages he sees a 
curious fluctuation in the development of negative expres- 
sions : 

1) The original negative became weak and insufficient, 

then, 

2) The negation was strengthened by some additional 
word: either an original negative (as in Slavic 
languages and in the older stages of the Germanic 
languages) or a positive word which was reevaluated 
as a negative by "attraction" (cf* M. Brial (1964, 
p. 200) "contagion") as for example, in French: 

pas (originally 'step') or in Czech z^dn;^ (original- 
ly 'whosoever'), etc. 

The interplay of these two main tendencies - weakening and 
strengthening - led to similar, though in some respects 
different development in Latin, French, English and other 
languages. As a very essential factor for such a development 
the author considers the incongruity between the gs];)SQ§} 
k&fillifiSS and the ffijffili iOSigOifiSSOSS <>f negative 
element (its phonetic bulk) which, he claims, was originally 



'53- 



emphasized in speech by mimicry and gestures. 

Jespersen notes another tendency which we may 
observe: v. 

* 3) The negative signal is strengthened in another 

place in the sentence. 

Jespersen demonstrates the stages of the develop- 
ment with examples taken from several Indo-European languages. 

Latin 

Type (1) ne dico 

This persists only in a few verbs, e.g., nescio , nolo , 
etc. and amalgamated expressions, e.g., nemo . Soon, 
however, it is strengthened by a positive word which 
amalgamates with the negative: 

Type (2) nan dico [ ne ♦ umm ( oenum ) ) . 

In Old Fre nch the process started in Latin continues: 

Type (3) jeo ne di (weakening) 

This survives in modern French only in a few expressions: 
je ne sai^s, je ne peux , etc., but is again felt to 
be too weak anJ is strengthened by positive expressive 
words which are ''attracted" by the negatives and fgli 
^ §5 BiS§U¥§i» e-g'. nas 'step', point, etc. TRus^ 
we get: > 

Type (4) ne d^ pas 

which in colloquial modern French drops the original 
negat ive : 

Type (S) 2^ dis pas (coll.). 

The Engl ish development was along similar lines: 

Type (1) OE ic n£ secge 

weakened and then strengthened by noht , nawiht » 
(originally ^nothing'), etc. 

Type (2) ME (ne) seye not 

Type (3) say not 

until the Elizabethans began to use the auxiliary do 
first in all kinds of sentences, then to restrict it to 
cases where strengthening was needed, i.e., questions, 
S£g§$i2Di emphasized affirmative statements. Thus 
we get : 

Type (4) Mn E ][ d^ no_t say 

O 

ERIC 



■S4- 



which again tends to be weakened to: 
Type (5) I donU say 

This last type is evidence of another tendency, counter- 
acting the signalling tendency: the attraction of the 
negative element to the verb, which results from the pre- 
ference for nexally negated sentences instead of possible, 
but not so often used, partial negation. Jespersen refers 
here to English and the Western languages. In Czech this 
tendency is strong, but in Russian it was never developed. 
This tendency works at the expense of unambiguity and leads 
often to misinterpretation^ especially in sentences with 
quantifiers, e.g., many of us^ d j^d n ' t w a n t tb^ war might 
mean either a) 'there were many of us who ^id Dg| y§Di the 
was' (negated predicate - "nexal'* negation), or, b) * there 
were uoj ffiiO^ (few) of us who wanted the war' (negated noun 
phrase by a "special*^ negation).*^ Ambiguity in speech is 
eliminated by stress and/or pitch on the negated term. My 
comment here is that in Russian it would be eliminated by 
a placement rule of the negative element. 

'^Special negation", states Jespersen, shows a 
tendency to amalgamate with the positive word and is mostly 
expressed by prefixes (native: un- or borrowed: in"/im- , 
a-). It might, though, be expressed by not which leads 
to ambiguity even in English copular sentences: she is not 
happy which may mean either a) negative sentence, or, 
b) i^ unhappy , affirmative sentence. 

Slavic negation developed along another line 
toward cumulative negation. We have seen that this way of 
expression was not uncommon in OR and ME. It is still 
productive in Modern English in substandard speech (e.g., 
i ^ t do nothing ) . It might be even a universal phenomenon, 
as we may observe it in non - Indo -European languages as well 
(e.g., Hungarian, Bantu languages, etc*)' 

As to its explanation, Jespersen disagrees both 
with van Ginneken^s theory of ^'primitivity*^ (which seems 
Q lim an explanation springing from a grammarian^s mind) 

ERJC 



-55- 



and with Gebauer's theory of '*qual itat ive" and "quantitative'* 
negation (which seems to him to be based on a misinterpre- 
tation of Kant's table of categories). He sets up his own 
"pet theory", as he calls it: 

two or three (negatives] in the same sentence 
cannot be termed illogical; they are simply a re^yn- 
dagjy [emphasis mine - I.E.] that may be superfluous 
From the stylistic point of view, just as any repeti- 
tion in a positive sentence (every and any, always 
^"d on aU occasions , etc.)i Put is"'5Therwise unobjec- ' 
TTonaFle. [Jespersen, 1917, p. 71) 

I would like to make a point here. Although I 
agree in general with a certain expressiveness of negation 
on the level of speech (as a marked member against the 
unmarked affirmative), I cannot agree with the comparison 
of cumulative Slavic negation with a stylistically marked 
emphatic construction like every and any . Cumulative 
Slavic negation is a grammatical device which leaves no 
choice, hence cannot be considered a stylistic factor. 

3. Prague School . The discussion of Slavic 
negation was taken up again by members of the Prague School. 

3,1 Mathesius . V. Mathesius' theory (1937) 
has much in common with Jespersen 's concept of "redundancy", 
although his idea is based on a very broad concept of 
grammatical concord, According to Mathesius, grammatical 
concord is a syntactic phenomenon by which one part of 
speech points to another part of speech in the same sentence 
to which it belongs syntactically by a formal sign which 
it does not need for its own denomination [p. 81], 

Note that Mathesius' concept approaches Ch. 
Bally's (1932) notion of "pl^onasme grammatical": 

On le voit: L'accord souligne par la concordance 
des formes est le cas peut-@tre le plus frequent du 
pl6onasme grammatical; c'est un puissant facteur 
de synthase. .. tout se tient [p, 124]. 

ERjC 



.56- 



This broad interpretation enables Mathesius to consider the 
specific Slavic way of negating all quantifiers (by nji) 
in nej^ative sentences as a ^'negation concord'^ In which one 
need not, as he points out, seek further semantic or stylis- 
tic explanation. Mc sees the problem as a historical one: 
to explain the desemant icizat ion of the negative particle 
ni to a purely formal sign.^ 

3. 2 Vach ek. Another representat ive of the 
Prague School > J. Vachek, further developed Mathcsius' 
concept and applied his methodology (contrastive analysis) 
in two studies on negation. 

In his contrastive study on Czech and English 
negation (1947) Vachek compares the different means of 
expressing general negation in sentences with quantifiers 
taking into account the semantics of the pronouns in both 
languages. He compares the function and development of the 
English any ■ type pronouns with the Czech ni^^type pronouns. 
The author believes that there Is a semantic need to have 
some kind of ptonoun which can negate any possible singular- 
ity, i.e., which serves as an "exclusive*' type of negation. 
This is one of the main reasons for cumulative negation 
with ni. In Slavic (Czech) this function was taken over 
by the negative pronouns', in English by the any - type. 

Vachek' s other paper (1940) is devoted to a 
typical Czech problem. The author takes up Gebauer's 
example: negation of Type J: Vse nebylo ztraceno meaning 
•nothing was lost' or 'not everything was lost something 
was left*, and points out that in spite of its ambiguity 
this type is still productive in modern colloquial Czech, 
By a meticulous analysis of the intonation pattern in such 
sentences the author shows that in this case the intonation 
(pitch) becomes a functional means of distinguishing 
generally and partially negated sentences; 

Vsude to neklape means Nikde to neklape 

* It doesn't work anywhere' (general negation, negative 
ch sentence) ; 



Vsude to n eklape means !^ck de to klape 

[somewhere it works] Mt works somewhere' (exclusive 
negation^ partially negated sentence). 

My point here is that Russian would prefer to 
express the second meaning by 

!l£ ILiii^ £i£ ^ ojstvuet (not everywhere this works] 

'It works somewhere' 
not Vs judu etc ne dejs tvuet {everywhere this does not work) 

This latter example is possible in a certain context and 
with a certain intonation line, e.g., 

^ y^^' vsjudu -to// eto ne dej stvuet 
'It works somewhere' 

^•^ Skalicfka . Another representative of the 
Prague School, V. SkaliJfka, tried to solve the problem of 
"special^' and ''nexal* negation in the light of general 
linguistics and typology in his study "Bemerkungen zur 
Negation' (1949). He analyzed the functioning of negation 
on different levels of the language system. 

The author observes that on the lexico-semant ic 
level the main characteristic of the negative morphemes is 
their Bgigo|4§J relationship to other morphemes. Ideally 
speaking, they have the 'Vidcst relat ion- field" . In ggtual 
iiB£y§g§» however, the meaning of the negated word shows a 
tendency to be "polarized'^ to the opposite meaning thus 
making a step towards the positive antonym, e.g., high - 
not high is polarized at low , etc, (cf. the A : Non-A 
and A : B functions mentioned at the beginning). 

The point I would like to make here is: 1) There 
has been up to now very little research conducted on the 
role of negation in the lexical system;^ 2) Examples given 
of the '/polarizing" tendency of negation in natural languages 



- with which I agree in general - are mostly chosen from a 
special class ot words dcnotuu^, a svthjoctlve cvalurtion of 
certain qualities (so-called "empirical predicates", such 

gQQ'l * hajd , etc.). Would it he as easy to discover 
the ''polarizing tendency of negated adverbs, e.g., today 

- not today ? Would it be "polarized" in tomorrow , yes ter - 
ililV lii ^ time , x time ago ? Would it be as easy to 
"polarize" the nega'tion of a verb, e.g., to t h in k - not to 
Uunk into its opposite pole and would it be: b^ idle 

stupid or labor (physically)? Would the opposition 

not remain a contradictory one? These considerations show, 

to my mind, that there is a need for more research on the 

semantics of the lexical system, as Rcvzin (1967) points 
7 

out. 

On the syntactic level, Skali^ka continues, 
negation is attracted, as a rule, by the verb. A negative 
sentence thus stands in contradictory opposition to its 
positive counterpart. (This does not hold true, however, 
for the Russian Language.) But Skalicka points out that a 
negative sentence need not be based on a negat ive judgment 
and vice versa, e.g., rt i^ m^ossible is an affirmative 
sentence based on a negative judgment. In this case, he 
explains, the SybslJiiys of the affirmative sentence is 
negative. 

In this way Skalicka tries to solve the old 
problem of the two functions of negation as they are reflected 
in natural languages. Some languages, he says, can express 
a contradictory opposition in a contrary form, e.g., English 
nobody kno ws - everybody knows , German niemand we i 3 - 
J edermann we i 3 ^ where other languages such as Slavic use 
a kind of "negation concord", e.g., Russian n i k t q ne znaet , 
which expresses the contradictory opposition. Therefore, 
according to SkaliSka, the solution of the problem of 
sentences with quantifiers presumes a very detailed study of 
the pronominal system, its development and its differentia- 
tion in each particular language. Most languages have

developcd contrary terms in pronomina (e.g., a1 1 - nothing , 
^^los nijchjU; tout - £icn, etc.)> but sometimes tiie 
oppositions are asiimoctric. 

Skaliifka maintains that wo cannot consider 
negation on the level of speech. Utterance, as a reaction 
upon a stimtilus, is always positive, even if clad in the 
form of a negative sentence. And, as the rolo of negation 
in the lan^iiage systt^m is given by its role in speech, he 
concludes that the whole language system is positive. 

My point here is that Skali^^ka bases his concep- 
tion on a psychological approach to speech. Certainly, a 
^•philosophical nihilism", as he calls it, would be out of 
place. To my mind , however , what is positive in negative 
utterances is the iQjea$ to utter them and not the utterance 
(formulated as a negative sentence) itself. 

4. Conclusion . This paper is part of a larger 
work on negation (Evreinov, 1973) in which I argue that a 
language system is a dynamic system based on oppositions 
(with predominant binary oppositions) where negation is 
latently present in weighing distinctions and discerning 
essentials from unessentials (i.e., in the lexical system, 
in denoting concepts) and before uttering judgments (i.e., 
in syntax, in producing sentences). 1 have outlined here the 
most important published views on negation in the Slavic 
languages. The notions of contrariety and contradiction can 
be related to the Prague School notions of equipollent and 
privative oppositions (contrariety) and the marked-unmarked 
binary oppositions, but a full discussion would lead me \oo 
far beyond the scope of this brief survey. The biblio- 
graphy includes some important works consulted in my larger 
work but not cited here. 

Not e s 

1. I use the terms common in logic in accordance 
with McCall (1952) . 

2. Neils tupny (1966), a Czech linguist, bases 
his theory of linguistic vagueness on KubiAski's concepts.

In (19S8) arul, especially, (I960) KuhiAski introcJaced new 
functors for negation and for exprcsslnc; the distance of 
a linguistic unit from its center. 

5. I am referring to Klima (1964]; Bach (\96S, 
pp. 95-08) discusses the problem of the placement of the 
negative element; Cliomsky ( 1972, p. 207) in discussing 
Jackendoff touches upon the problem of the position of the 
negative element for correct semantic interpretation* 

4. Cf. Chomsky (1972) and his example on p. 207 
1151 Eillit the t a r g e t , etc. 

V Two leading Russian linguists, Potebnja (1958) 

and Saxmatov (1952) tried to explain concessive clauses 
^^^^ Di same manner. 

6. To mention here, however, N^mec (1969). 

7. Chafe (1970) tries to focus attention on 
neglected matters of meaning and to reveal the seinantics 
already present in the deep structure.

INTRODUCTION 


The International Nuclear Information System (INIS) 


INIS is a cooperative, decentralized information system set up 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency and its Member States. 
Its purpose is to construct a data base identifying publications relat- 
ing to nuclear science and its peaceful applications. Member States 
and cooperating international organizations scan the scientific and 
technical literature published within their boundaries or by them, 
select from it those items which fall within the subject scope of 
INIS') and process the data according to the agreed standards and 
rules. Document descriptions, abstracts and, in certain cases, full 
texts of the literature are then submitted to the IAEA Headquarters, 
where those data are merged and the INIS output products compiled. 
The following services are issued: 


— The INIS magnetic tape service 
— INIS Atomindex: a semi-monthly abstracting journal?) 
— INIS non-conventional literature on microfiche?) 


Availability and price of INIS services 
MAGNETIC TAPE SERVICE 


This semi-monthly service, providing magnetic tapes containing 
all records submitted to the system, is availabie only to participating 
Member States and International Organizations. National INIS 
centres in many countries are utilizing INIS tapes in the provision of 
national information services. Available services vary from country 
to country and interested persons are requested to contact their 
national INIS Liaison Officer whose name and address appear on the 
inside cover of this journal.

1) The scope of INIS is defined by the scope of the IAEA’s interests. Full 
details of the INIS scope are printed in IAEA-INIS-3, INIS: Subject Categories 
and Scope Descriptions. This is a publication in the INIS Reference Series which 
defines the standards and rules for INIS. Copies of all documents in the INIS

tapes by computer-driven photocomposition methods. The bulk of the 
information contained in the magnetic tapes is printed in INIS Atomindex. The 
major exception to this are the subject descriptors, whose main use is for 
computer-searching. These are omitted from all INIS Atomindex entries that are 
accompanied by abstracts.

Personal Author Index 


The name of each personal author of every document cited is listed 
in the form in which it appears in the main entry. Hence, an author’s 
naine may appear more than once, depending on whether a forename is 
spelled out or only initials are given. Note also that names preceded by 
“name fragments” such as “de” “van”, “von” etc., may appear either 
under the name fragment or under the main part of the name, depending 
on local practices for treating such names. 

Each entry gives the full title of the document and the RN of the 
main entry for that document. If the document is a technical report or 
patent document, the report number or patent number is given in 
brackets, following the title.

Corporate Entry Index 


The names of corporate entries are listed in the form specified in 
INIS: Authority List for Corporate Entries and Report Number Prefixes 
(IAEA-INIS-6). Whenever appropriate, references are made from 
superseded forms of the corporate names, or from forms that have not 
been adopted, to the forms of the names used in this index. Note, 
however, that index entries are not included for corporate bodies cited 
only as an author's affiliation. 

Each entry gives the full title of the document for which the 
corporate body is responsible, and the RN for the main entry of that 
document. If the document is a technical report or patent document 
the report number or patent document number is given in brackets, 
following the title.

Report, Standard and Patent Number Index 


Entries for publications are arranged according to the number assigned 
to them by the organizations or institutions responsible for their pro- 
duction or distribution. If a document has not been assigned a reference 
number at the source, it is assigned an INIS-mf— number by the INIS 
Secretariat. Patent numbers are listed under the general heading 
PATENTS. 

Each index entry gives the RN for the main entry of the document 
and a note indicating its availability. If this note consists of, or 
contains the acronym “INIS”, a microfiche copy of the document is 
available from the INIS Clearinghouse. Otherwise a source from which 
a copy of the document may be obtained is given. On occasion, the 
availability of the document in another form is also indicated. See also 
the section headed “How to obtain copies of documents cited in INIS 
Atomindex”, below.

Subject Index 


Each document listed in INIS Atomindex is entered under one or 
more alphabetically listed subject headings. These are constructed from 
descriptors selected from among those assigned to the magnetic-tape 
record for the document, and usually consist of a pair of descriptors, one 
used as a main heading and the-second as a qualifier of that main heading. 
The main headings are selected to describe as specifically as possible an 
important concept in the document, and the qualifiers are selected to 
provide further information about the main heading. Occasionally, a 
document is so general or covers so many aspects of the concept 
represented by the main heading that the use of a qualifier is not 
appropriate. The full index entry includes, in addition to the title of the 
document, the one or more subject categories that have been assigned to 
the document (printed in brackets), and the RN of the main entry for 
the document. Additional information on the content of the document 
may be included within the brackets with the categories as an 
augmentation of the title. 

The subject index also includes references from terms not adopted 
for indexing to the approved terms (descriptors) under which information 
may be found (see references); see also references are intended to 
guide the index user from one subject heading to another under which 
related material may also be indexed. 

For additional guidance to subject headings under which references 
of interest might be found, see INIS: Thesaurus (IAEA-INIS-13).

How to obtain copies of the documents cited in INIS Atomindex 


Copies of the technical reports, conference preprints, patents, 
standards and theses (i.e. non-conventional literature) are normally 
available in microfiche format from the INIS Clearinghouse. For 
those items of non-conventional literature which are not available 
from the INIS Clearinghouse, the Report, Standard and Patent Number 
Index entry provides information regarding availability from another 
source or in another form. 


Most of the conventional, commercially published literature 
abstracted in INIS Atomindex, including books and journal articles, 
may be found in major libraries around the world. However, 
enquirers having difficulty in obtaining access to any of the literature 
cited in INIS Atomindex should seek the assistance of the national 
INIS Liaison Officer in their country (a list of Liaison Officers is 
printed on the inside covers of this index). For publications issued 
in particular countries, enquiries may also be made to the organiza- 
tions listed below.

United States of America 


In the United States, the source of public availability of most 
US reports announced in INIS Atomindex is the National Technical

field, Virginia 22161. Telephone: (703) 557-4650. Telex: 89-9405. 
Some reports are available for the Superintendent of Documents, 
US Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402. 
In INIS Atomindex, the specific source for each US report is given 
with the abstract entry, together with the NTIS price code. The 
following table is an explanation of the code. Section A is the stan- 
dard code and provides a code АО] for the Standard microfiche price 
of $3.00 per title ($4.50 for non-North American purchases), and 
codes A02 through A24 plus A99 for prices of printed reports 
dependent upon the page count of the report. Section E is for docu- 
ments which the sponsoring agency wants to pricé at a higher or 
lower price than that called for by the page count, as determined in 
Section A. These are coded as ЕО1 through E20 plus E99. Note that 
the price for non-North American purchases of paper copies is double 
the price given in this table.

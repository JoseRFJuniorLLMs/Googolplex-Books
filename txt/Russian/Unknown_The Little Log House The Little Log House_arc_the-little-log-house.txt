HERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE 
LOG HOUSE STANDING IN A 
FIELD 


One day a Mouse came scuttling up and saw it. 

“What a nice little house!” she said. “Yoo-hoo! Anyone 
there?” 

There was no reply, so the Mouse ran into the house and 
made her home there. 

By and by a Frog came hopping up. 


By and by a Rabbit came scam- 


ring up. 
What a nice little house!” he 
said. “Yoo-hoo! Anyone there?” 

“We are. Crunch-Munch the 
Mouse and Hop-Stop the Frog. 
And who are you?” 

“Fleet-Feet the Rabbit.” 

“Well, why don't you move in 
with us?” 

So in the Rabbit jumped, and 
the three of them made their 
home in the house.

CHAPTER  1. 


COMBUSTION  OF  HOMOGENEOUS  ENERGETIC  MATERIALS 
1.1.  GENERAL  BACKGROUND 

Combustion  of  solid  energetic  materials  (EM)  is  characterized  by  simultaneous  course  of  set  of 
processes,  connected  with  intense  warm-up  of  substance  and  its  gasification  in  a  relatively  nar¬ 
row  spatial  domain.  These  are  various  phase  transitions,  chemical  reactions  in  the  condensed  and 
gas  phases,  the  dispersion  of  the  condensed  phase  and  the  reactions  in  the  dispersed  phase,  the 
processes  of  mass-  and  heat  transfer,  etc.  Heat,  which  evolves  in  chemical  reactions,  serves  as 
driving  force  for  combustion  of  solid  EM,  and  velocity  of  the  combustion  wave  propagation  is 
determined  in  essence  by  kinetics  of  chemical  reactions  and  heat  emissions  from  combustion 
zone  as  it  was  for  the  first  time  shown  in  works  of  Ya.  B.  Zeldovich  and  D.  A.  Franck- 
Kamenetskii  [1,2]. 

From  mathematical  point  of  view  a  process  of  propagation  of  combustion  wave  is  described  by 
the  system  of  equations  of  heat-  and  mass  transfer  with  sources  of  heat  and  mater.  The  character¬ 
istic  feature  of  the  problem  is  strong  nonlinearity  of  sources.  The  presence  of  the  terms,  which 
exponentially  depend  on  the  temperature,  determines  specific  behavior  of  the  burning  EM. 

Let  us  mention  briefly  several  issues  related  to  the  existence  of  self-sustaining  combustion  waves. 
Quantitative  criteria  of  realization  of  the  combustion  process  can  be  represented  on  the  basis  of 
physical  considerations  and  approximate  estimates  in  the  form  [3,  4]. 

P  =  RTJE«  1,  y  -  ficT*  /  <2  « 1  (1.1) 

Here  T  -  characteristic  temperature  of  a  process;  R  -  universal  gas  constant;  E  and  Q  -  energy  of 
activation  and  the  thermal  effect  of  reaction,  respectively;  c  -  specific  heat. 

The  physical  meaning  of  inequality  (1.1)  is  the  following:  the  energy  of  activation  of  the  com¬ 
bustion  reaction  must  be  considerably  higher  than  the  energy  of  the  thermal  agitation  of  the 
molecules  at  a  characteristic  temperature  of  process,  and  the  magnitude  of  exothermic  thermal 
effect  must  considerably  exceed  certain  scale  quantity  of  heat.  It  will  be  shown  below  that  criteria 
(1.1)  give  the  upper  estimation  of  the  necessary  conditions  for  existence  of  the  combustion  wave. 
It  is  important  to  note  that  these  criteria  do  not  include  direct  information  about  reactions  there¬ 
fore  chemical  nature  of  the  reactions  of  combustion  can  be  most  different.  Actually,  together  with 
the  classical  cases  of  oxidative  exothermal  reactions  the  processes  are  known  of  combustion, 
caused  by  the  reactions  of  thermal  decomposition  (combustion  of  explosives),  direct  synthesis 
(combustion  of  hydrogen  with  chlorine,  bromine),  etc. 

Let  us  consider  equation  of  thermal  conductivity  for  the  case  of  one-dimensional  propagation  of 
stationary  wave  of  combustion  in  infinite  space  of  homogeneous  medium: 

Ad2T/dx2 -mcdT/dx  +  <!>(T)  =  0  (1.2) 

Here  x  -  coordinate;  X  -  thermal  conductivity;  d>(T)  -  source  function  of  heat  release;  m  -  mass 
burning  rate. 


1—1 


Equation  (1.2)  is  written  in  moving  coordinate  system  attached  to  the  flame  front.  Natural  bound¬ 
ary  conditions  consist  in  the  fact  that  on  one  of  end  points  we  will  assume  the  reaction  be  com¬ 
pleted,  and  on  other  -  not  started  yet. 

M-oo,  r->T0;  T  ^Tm=T0+Qlc.  (1.3) 

The  value  of  mass  burning  rate  m  plays  a  role  of  eigenvalue  of  the  problem  (1.2),  (1.3).  In  order 
to  ensure  existence  of  solution  of  the  energy  equation  (1.2)  it  must  be  implemented  additionally 
<I>(Tm)=0  and  <J>(To)=0.  Condition  O(Tm)=0  is  provided  by  the  complete  consumption  of  parent 
substance.  However,  condition  d>(T0)=O  for  ordinary  initial  temperatures  To  is  not  satisfied,  since 
from  chemical  kinetics  it  follows  that  <I>(To)  ~  exp(-E/RTo)^0  with  To>0.  From  the  analysis  car¬ 
ried  out  in  works  [5,  6],  it  follows  that  for  the  uniqueness  of  the  solution  of  the  problem  one  ad¬ 
ditional  limitation  should  be  superimposed  to  the  source  function,  namely:  dO(To)/dx<0. 

The  existence  criterion  for  steady-state  solution  of  the  problem  (1.2)  in  the  form  d>(To)=  0  looks 
not  justified  in  real  conditions  (T0>  0).  However,  due  to  large  energy  of  activation  for  the  most 
chemical  reactions  the  values  of  <I>(T)  and  dd>(T)/dT  are  close  to  zero  at  T— »To.  Therefore  the 
function  <3>(T)  can  be  artificially  modified  in  the  vicinity  of  To,  so  that  condition  <3>(T)  =  0  is  ful¬ 
filled.  Actually,  it  is  made  by  equating  function  <3>(T)  to  zero  in  certain  range  of  the  temperature 
close  to  To: 

d>(T)  =  0;  atT0<T<Ti 
3>(T)>  0;  at  Ti  <  T  <  Tm 

Direct  numerical  calculation  of  the  dependence  of  mass  burning  rate  m  on  Ti  with  variation  of  the 
latter  in  the  range  (To  Tm)  has  been  conducted  by  A.G.Merzhanov  et  al.  [7].  It  turned  out  that 
the  value  of  m  relatively  weakly  depends  on  the  choice  of  Ti  value  (if  it  does  not  become  too 
close  to  Tm)  provided  that  the  following  relationship  between  parameters  y  and  P  is  met: 

E  =  Y  -  P  =  cRT0Tm/QE  <  1  (1.4) 

The  new  parameter  T  characterizes  the  ratio  of  the  reaction  rates  at  the  temperatures  Tm  and  To: 
0(Tm)/  3>(To)  =  exp(l/T).  When  parameter  T  exceeds  numerically  0.1,  the  steady-state  combus¬ 
tion  wave  can  not  exist.  Critical  value  T=  0.1  corresponds  to  the  value  0(Tm)/  d>(To)  =  104. 

Inequality  (1.4)  shows  the  requirements  for  the  heat  release  source,  which  should  be  met  in  order 
to  provide  steady-state  combustion.  Namely,  the  activation  energy  of  exothermic  reaction  has  to 
be  much  higher  the  energy  of  thermal  motion  of  molecules  at  initial  temperature  (E»RTo),  and 
thermal  effect  of  the  reaction  should  be  comparable  in  value  with  the  enthalpy  of  system  at  initial 
temperature  (Q  ~  cTo,  or  Q  >  cTo). 

1.2.  STAGE  COMBUSTION  CONCEPT 

The  aim  of  the  combustion  simulation  is  to  calculate  the  value  of  the  burning  rate  and  its  depend¬ 
encies  on  variation  of  external  conditions  (pressure,  temperature,  mass  forces,  etc.).  The  great  va¬ 
riety  and  complexity  of  the  processes  in  the  combustion  wave  lead  to  the  necessity  of  developing 
the  approximate  combustion  models. 

As  is  already  mentioned,  the  velocity  of  the  combustion  wave  propagation  is  closely  related  with 
chemical  kinetics.  Impossibility  of  the  detailed  description  of  chemical  and  physical  phenomena 
in  the  combustion  wave  of  real  condensed  system  leads  to  the  approach  based  on  isolation  of 


1—2 


particular  stages  in  the  combustion  wave.  Thus,  individual  (complex)  chemical  kinetics  of  the 
propellant  is  replaced  by  the  proper  dependencies  of  the  heat  release  rate  in  the  global  chemical 
reactions  on  concentration  and  temperature. 

Isolation  and  mathematical  description  of  chemical  transformation  stages  can  be  easily  correlated 
with  the  physical  sequence  of  the  mater  transformations  in  the  combustion  wave.  One  of  the  natu¬ 
ral  ways  for  the  stages  isolation  is  their  division  by  the  phase  states.  As  a  rule,  it  is  assumed  that 
we  have  one  global  reaction  in  the  condensed  phase  and  one  or  two  reactions  in  the  gas  phase. 
Upon  one-dimensional  analysis  of  the  problem  these  reactions  (stages)  may  proceed  in  entirely 
different  spatial  zones  or  can  be  partly  overlapped.  For  example,  one  may  expect  that  in  combus¬ 
tion  of  energetic  materials  with  well  pronounced  dispersion  of  subsurface  layer,  the  reactions  in 
the  condensed  phase  (aerosol  particles)  and  in  gaseous  flame  are  spatially  overlapped. 

In  some  limiting  case  it  becomes  possible  to  determine  so  called  “rate  control”  stage  in  the  com¬ 
bustion  wave.  By  definition,  the  rate  control  stage  determines  the  burning  rate  of  the  system  in 
such  a  way  that  its  mathematical  description  provides  close  to  realistic  values  calculation  of  the 
magnitude  of  the  burning  rate  as  well  as  its  dependencies  on  external  conditions  without  taking 
into  account  the  variety  of  the  processes  outside  this  stage.  Mathematical  models  of  the  rate  con¬ 
trol  stage  are  called  (in  Russian  literature)  elementary  combustion  models  (ECM).  Their  brief 
analysis  and  classification  are  given  in  Ref.  [8]. 

1.2.1.  Interaction  of  the  stages. 

Change  in  ambient  conditions  for  combustion  (pressure,  temperature,  mass  forces)  can  lead  to 
redistribution  of  the  functions  of  separate  stages.  The  rate  control  stage  can  become  subordinate, 
and  vice  versa. 

In  this  case  the  dependence  of  burning  rate  on  environmental  factors  can  be  changed,  and  the 
propagation  of  the  combustion  wave  will  be  described  by  other  EMC.  The  reason  for  the  change 
of  the  rate  control  stage  is  different  sensitivity  of  the  reaction  rates  in  different  stages  to  varia¬ 
tions  in  the  ambient  conditions.  The  works  [9-12]  and  individual  chapters  [13,14]  are  devoted  to 
investigation  of  regimes  of  reacting  in  different  stages.  The  attention  is  concentrated  in  the  analy¬ 
sis  of  the  simplest  cases  and  classification  of  basic  laws  governing  the  phenomenon.  Let  us  ex¬ 
amine  their  basic  idea  briefly. 

Let  the  combustion  wave  propagates  in  homogeneous  (gas  or  condensed)  medium  with  two  con¬ 
secutive  reactions  A— »B— >C.  The  thermal  effects  of  consecutive  reactions  are  designated  as  Qi 
(A->B)  and  Q2  (B-»C). 

Let  us  assume  for  certainty  Q  i>0.  There  is  no  special  requirement  for  sign  of  Q  i  but  it  is  neces¬ 
sary  that  the  sum  of  Q  \  and  Q  2  would  be  positive  and  higher  then  the  certain  limiting  value. 
Then  the  combustion  temperature  equals  Tm  =To+(Qi+Q2)/c,  and  the  temperature,  which  corre¬ 
sponds  to  the  course  only  of  the  first  reaction,  is  T10  =  To  +  Q  i/c.  There  are  also  introduced 
ui(Tio)  -  rate  of  the  propagation  of  the  wave  of  only  first  reaction  with  its  thermal  effect;  ui(Tm)  - 
rate,  which  corresponds  to  the  case  when  the  second  reaction  proceeds  very  rapidly,  so  that  the 
combustion  temperature  already  at  the  end  of  the  first  stage  is  established;  U2(Tm)  -  rate,  which 


1—3 


corresponds  to  the  course  of  the  second  reaction  at  a  combustion  temperature  (first  reaction  is 
very  fast). 

As  a  result  of  analytical  examination  and  numerical  solution  of  the  problem  the  authors  of  cited 
works  established  existence  of  three  stage  combustion  regimes: 

2nd  stage  rate  control, 
stage  detachment,  and 
stage  merging. 

In  all  cases  the  corresponding  mass  flow  rates  of  the  first  and  second  stages  must  be  identical  and 
equal  to  the  mass  burning  rate  m.  It  is  convenient  to  examine  the  propagation  of  the  combustion 
wave  through  the  immobile  substance.  Let  us  examine  case  of  Q  i>0.  If  in  this  case 
ui(Tio)>U2(Tm),  the  wave  of  the  first  stage  goes  away  forward,  the  second  stage  virtually  does  not 
influence  the  first,  which  in  this  case  can  be  named  rate  control.  This  regime  is  named  the  regime 
of  detachment. 

If  U2(Tm)>ui(Tio),  the  wave  of  second  high-temperature  stage  will  overtake  wave  of  the  first 
stage.  In  this  case  in  the  first  stage  wave  the  temperature  will  increase,  and  the  burning  rate  will 
increase  too,  until  with  certain  finite  distance  between  the  zones  of  the  first  and  second  reactions 
the  condition  UiOT)  =  U2(Tm)  is  not  satisfied.  With  an  accidental  increase  in  the  inter-zone  dis¬ 
tance  the  first  zone  is  cooled  (obtaining  less  heat  feedback  from  the  second)  and  it  is  braked,  ap¬ 
proaching  thus  the  second  zone,  and  vice  virsa,  so  that  the  process  is  stable.  The  temperature  at 
the  end  of  the  first  zone  Ti  no  longer  is  equal  to  Tio  and  cannot  be  found  from  the  thermodynamic 
calculations.  This  combustion  behavior  is  named  the  2nd  stage  rate  control  mode.  That  means  that 
the  second  stage  rules  the  rate  of  the  first,  and  u  =  U2(Tm). 

If  equality  ui(T)  =  U2(Tm)  is  not  fulfilled  up  to  achievement  in  the  first  zone  of  temperature  Tm 
then  the  burning  rate  is  limited  by  the  first  stage  and  u=  ui(Tm)  <  U2(Tm).  This  regime  is  named 
the  stage  merging. 

Domains  of  realization  of  different  stage  combustion  regimes  (for  the  case  of  Qi>0)  can  be  de¬ 
fined,  when  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  always  U2(Tm)  >  U2(Tio),  in  the  form: 

u  =  u2(Tm);  ui(Tm)  >  u2(Tm)  >  ui(T i0)  -  2nd  stage  rate  control 

u  =  ui(Tio);  Ui(Tm)  >  ui(T10)  >  u2(Tm)  -  stage  detachment  (1.5) 

u  =  ui(Tm);  u2(Tm)  >  ui(Tm)  >  ui(Ti0)  -  stage  merging 

In  the  case,  when  parameters  of  separate  stages  are  such  that  one  of  given  inequalities  is  fulfilled, 
the  burning  rate  of  two-stage  combustion  is  close  to  that,  which  in  this  inequality  occupies  a  mid¬ 
position. 

If  the  first  reaction  is  endothermic,  Qi<0,  the  following  inequalities  can  be  met: 

ui(Tm)>u2(Tm)  or  U2(Tm)>ui(Tm)  (1-6) 

In  this  case  true  burning  rate  is  close  to  the  single-stage  rate,  which  has  minimal  value,  i.e.,  con¬ 
ditions  are  realized  for  the  regimes  either  of  2nd  stage  rate  control  or  stage  merging.

For  the  first  time  one  of  the  possible  regimes  of  stage  combustion  of  condensed  systems  was 
theoretically  examined  by  Ya.  B.  Zel'dovich.  This  is  widely  known  gas-phase  combustion  model 
[15]  based  on  the  combustion  mechanism  of  the  volatile  (secondary)  explosives  developed  by  A. 
F.  Belyayev  [16].  In  [15],  the  combustion  model  of  volatile  explosives  has  been  applied  to  the 
combustion  of  double  base  propellants. 

The  hypothetical  mechanism  of  the  combustion  of  double  base  propellants  [15]  differs  from  that 
for  volatile  explosives  only  in  terms  of  the  fact  that  the  gasification  of  the  condensed  phase  oc¬ 
curs  as  a  result  of  the  irreversible  endothermic  (or  weakly-exothermic)  chemical  reaction.  The 
rich  in  energy  gaseous  decomposition  products  of  condensed  phase  react  further  in  the  gas  phase 
releasing  basic  amount  of  heat.  The  part  of  the  heat  separated  in  the  gas  phase  is  expended  on  the 
gasification  of  condensed  phase  and  its  warm-up  from  the  initial  temperature  To  to  the  tempera¬ 
ture  of  surface  Ti.  In  this  case  the  distance  between  the  zone  of  heat  evolution  in  the  gaseous 
phase  and  the  surface  of  condensed  phase  is  such  that  the  heat  flux  to  the  surface  of  propellant 
provides  the  mass  flow  rate  of  gasification,  exactly  equal  to  the  mass  flow  rate  in  the  gas  phase. 
According  to  the  introduced  terminology  this  combustion  is  in  the  2nd  stage  rate  control  mode. 

Formula  for  the  mass  burning  rate  is  similar  to  expression  for  wave  propagation  velocity  of  com¬ 
bustion  in  gas: 

m 2  =  2 n!(cRTm  /QE  )nH(Xp/c)k0  exp(-E/RTm  )  (1.7) 

Here  n  -  order  of  reaction;  X,  c,  p  -  thermal  conductivity,  specific  heat  and  gas  density  of  gas  re¬ 
spectively;  ko  and  E  -  pre-exponent  and  activation  energy;  Q  -  thermal  effect  of  gas-phase  reac¬ 
tion;  Tm  =  T0'  +  Q/c  -  maximum  combustion  temperature;  To'=To+Qi/ci  -  equivalent  initial  tem¬ 
perature;  To  -  initial  temperature;  Qi  -  thermal  effect  of  gasification  of  condensed  phase. 

Dependence  of  the  burning  rate  on  pressure  p  and  initial  temperature  To  is  characterized  by  coef¬ 
ficients 

v  =  dlnm/dlnp  =  n/2,  P  =  dlnm/dTo  =  E/2RTm2  . 

Three-stage  model  of  combustion  (one  chemical  stage  occurs  in  the  condensed  phase  and  two  -  in 
gas)  is  proposed  by  V.  N.  Vilyunov  [17].  The  approach  presented  in  his  work  can  be  easily  ap¬ 
plied  to  an  arbitrary  number  of  successive  stages;  therefore  without  loss  of  generality  one  may 
examine  the  simpler  case  when  the  reactions  proceed  in  two  stages:  the  first  stage  in  the  con¬ 
densed  phase  (x<0)  and  the  second  -  in  the  gas  phase  (x>0). 

Stationary  process  of  combustion  wave  propagation  is  described  by  the  system  of  equations  of 
mass  and  energy  conservation.

Here  T0  -  initial  temperature;  Tsi  =  T0+Qi/ci  -  the  temperature  of  the  condensed  phase  surface, 
which  corresponds  to  the  course  only  of  first  reaction;  Q  -  thermal  effect;  c,  X  -  specific  heat  and 
thermal  conductivity;  a  -  concentration;  p  -  density;  D  -  diffusion  coefficient. 

It  is  assumed  for  the  condensed  phase  pi  =  const,  Di  =  0  and  for  the  gas-phase  reaction  Q2  >  0. 
There  are  no  limitations  to  the  sign  of  the  thermal  effect  of  reaction  in  the  condensed  phase.  It  is 
also  proposed  that  the  reaction  rate  in  the  condensed  phase  <3>i  does  not  depend  on  pressure.  The 
temperature  of  surface  Ts  in  the  boundary  condition  at  x  =  0  has  to  be  determined.  Boundary  con¬ 
dition  for  the  heat  flux  at  x  =  0  is  obtained  on  the  basis  of  the  following  computations.  Integrating 
equations  for  aj  and  a2  from  x  =  to  x  =  one  obtains  the  relationship

tion;  E  and  ko  -  activation  energy  and  pre-exponent  in  Arrhenius's  law  for  the  reaction  rate;  Ki  =

In  expressions  for  mi  and  m2  the  unknown  value  is  Ts  but  since  during  stationary  combustion  mi 
=  m2  =  m,  relationships  (1.11)  and  (1.12)  can  he  considered  as  the  system  for  two  unknowns,  m 
and  Ts.  Thus,  for  example,  during  the  combustion  in  the  regime  of  stage  detachment  the  burning 
rate  is  determined  by  the  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  (which  is  the  rate  control  stage)  and  is 
calculated  on  the  basis  of  (1.11)  when  Ts  =  Tsi  (Qi>0). 

1.2.2.  Determination  of  the  rate  control  stage. 

Analysis  of  numerical  solution  of  the  problem  on  the  stage  flame  propagation  in  homogeneous 
gaseous  medium  showed  [10]  that  change  of  combustion  behavior  occurs  in  relatively  narrow 
range  of  parameters  variation.  The  conclusion  is  made  that  for  such  conditions  it  is  possible  to 
establish  the  control  stage.  The  procedure  to  choose  the  control  stage  is  described  above:  actual 
burning  rate  is  close  in  the  value  to  the  value  of  the  rate,  calculated  according  to  the  relationships 
for  the  separate  stage  and  occupying  the  intermediate  position  between  the  minimum  and  maxi¬ 
mum  burning  rate  values. 


Upon  transfer  to  modeling  the  processes  of  condensed  systems  combustion  question  of  the  choice 
of  the  control  stage  becomes  more  complex  and  less  clear  than  in  the  case  of  combustion  of 
gases.  The  specific  difficulties  appear,  connected  with  the  correct  description  of  the  chemical 
transformations  simultaneously  elapsing  in  the  combustion  wave  and  change  in  the  physical  state 
of  the  substance:  solid  -  gas-saturated  subsurface  layer  -  gas  phase 

According  to  available  data,  in  combustion  of  double  base  and  composite  propellants  chemical 
reactions  start  in  the  condensed  phase  and  are  continued  in  dispersed  particles  of  solid  propellant. 
Furthermore,  chemical  reactions  occur  in  the  gas  bubbles  within  the  surface  layer  of  the  con¬ 
densed  phase  and  then  in  the  flame.  With  a  variation  in  the  ambient  conditions  for  combustion  the 
relative  role  of  reactions  in  one  or  the  other  spatial  zones  can  be  changed.  For  example,  it  is  pos¬ 
sible  situation  when  the  completeness  of  chemical  transformations  of  gaseous  decomposition 
products  of  solid  propellant  increases  with  pressure  within  the  limits  of  condensed  phase.  In  this 
case  one  has  to  assign  heat  evolution  from  these  reactions  not  to  the  adjacent  gas  zone,  but  to  the 
gas-saturated  surface  layer  of  solid  propellant. 

In  existing  analytical  models  of  solid  propellant  combustion  chemical  stage  nature,  as  a  rule,  is 
unambiguously  linked  with  physical  stage  nature  of  transformation  of  substance  in  the  combus¬ 
tion  wave.  Unfortunately,  these  data  are  hardly  available  and  restricted  in  volume.  There  are  no 
reliable  experimental  proofs  of  existence  at  the  elevated  pressures  of  developed  foamy  zone  on 
the  surface  of  solid  propellant  or  of  the  intense  dispersion  of  the  surface  layers  of  condensed 
phase  in  the  literature.  It  is  necessary  also  to  pay  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  particle  concentra¬ 
tion  in  the  flow  of  combustion  products  typically  is  relatively  low.  This  is  due  to  a  significant  in¬ 
crease  in  the  volume  of  the  products  of  combustion  upon  conversion  of  substance  from  the  con¬ 
densed  state  to  the  gas:  medium  density  is  changed  by  tens  and  hundreds  of  times.  Consequently, 
in  the  one  dimensional  description  of  combustion  in  the  two  phase  flow  of  combustion  products  it 
is  necessary  to  carefully  perform  the  procedures  of  the  averaging  of  the  hydrodynamic  parameters 
and  the  function  of  heat  release. 

In  simplest  version,  if  we  do  not  consider  reactions  of  dispersed  particles  of  condensed  phase  in 
the  smoke-gas  zone  above  the  burning  surface  when  modeling  combustion  of  EM,  one  may  ex¬ 
amine  following  two  cases. 

Let  in  the  condensed  phase  the  reactions  proceed  with  the  summary  zero  thermal  effect  (or  en¬ 
dothermic).  It  is  obvious  that  this  excludes,  the  combustion  regime  with  the  rate  control  stage  in 
the  condensed  phase,  but  there  may  exist  regimes  with  the  rate  control  stage  in  the  gaseous  phase, 
when  gas-phase  reactions  at  a  temperature  of  flame  T2  determine  the  burning  rate  as  well  as  re¬ 
gime  with  the  stage  merging  when  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  occur  at  a  temperature  close 
to  T2.  For  simplicity  it  is1  assumed  here  that  the  reactions  in  the  gas  occur  into  one  stage,  though, 
as  it  follows  from  that  stated  above,  this  approach  is  easily  generalized  to  an  arbitrary  number  of 
stages. 

In  the  second  case  the  exothermic  transformations  occur  also  in  the  condensed  phase.  Then  in 
addition  to  already  named  the  regime  of  stage  detachment  should  be  added,  when  reactions  in  the 
gas  have  finite  duration  of  the  induction  period.  Let  us  note,  however,  that  in  both  cases  the  re- 


gime  of  stage  merging  is  hardly  expected.  For  real  gasified  EM  the  examples  are  unknown  when 
on  the  surface  of  condensed  phase  so  high  temperature  has  been  realized. 

It  should  be  noted  that  existing  theoretical  models  in  majority  of  cases  are  based  on  the  concepts 
of  narrow  zones  of  chemical  transformations,  whereas  in  the  combustion  of  series  of  EM  (nitro- 
esters,  nitramines,  mixture  compositions  on  their  basis)  typically  the  wide  zones  are  realized,  for 
which  theoretical  analysis  of  stage  combustion  were  not  fully  conducted. 

When  searching  the  rate  control  stages  in  the  combustion  wave  of  EM  it  is  useful  to  take  into  ac¬ 
count  qualitative  considerations  about  dependence  of  degree  of  the  control  effect  of  one  or  an 
other  spatial  zone  on  its  distance  from  the  burning  surface.  On  the  basis  of  intuitive  ideas  the 
concept  has  been  introduced  [18]  about  the  “influence  zone”  as  the  spatial  domain,  for  which  the 
processes  beyond  its  bounds  do  not  affect  the  burning  rate.  From  the  equation  of  thermal  conduc¬ 
tivity,  written  for  the  heat  flux  in  the  gas  phase  under  the  natural  boundary  condition  at  infinity  (x 
— >  -°o,  q  =  0),  we  obtain  expression  for  the  heat  flux  into  the  condensed  phase  (<f>(x)  is  the  heat 
release  in  the  gas  phase): 

qs  =  J<F(;c)exp(-cpicc/A)d[x  (1-13) 

o 

In  accordance  with  expression  (1.13)  the  "efficiency"  of  heat  feed  back  from  different  zones  of 
heat  release  in  gas  is  lower,  the  further  this  zone  locates  from  the  burning  surface.  This  fact  is 
noted  also  in  [24], 

The  search  of  the  rate  control  stage  for  real  EM  was  sometimes  conducted  on  the  basis  of  intui¬ 
tive  physical  considerations.  In  this  case  the  quantitative  analysis  of  governing  the  combustion 
laws  was  not  always  consecutively  conducted,  mainly  the  qualitative  characteristics  of  the  proc¬ 
ess  were  analysed:  the  dependence  of  burning  rate  on  p  and  To.  As  a  result  the  situations  appeared 
when  for  the  same  type  of  EM  the  different  authors  treated  the  mechanism  of  combustion  from 
the  diametrically  opposite  positions.  Thus,  according  to  [19-21],  the  rate  control  stage  during  the 
combustion  of  nitroglycerin  powders  under  the  pressures  up  to  100  atm  is  in  the  gas  phase.  How¬ 
ever,  in  accordance  with  [22,  23]  it  is  in  the  condensed  phase.  At  the  same  time  there  is  a  suffi¬ 
ciently  substantiated  opinion  that  during  the  combustion  of  these  compositions  it  is  impossible  in 
this  pressure  range  to  define  the  rate  control  stage  and  both  gas  and  condensed  phase  should  be 
taken  into  consideration  [21], 

Summarizing,  the  above  indicates  that  theoretical  approach  for  determination  of  the  rate  control 
stages  in  combustion  of  condensed  EM  is  considerably  less  developed,  than  in  the  case  of  com¬ 
bustion  of  gas  systems.  It  is  especially  difficult  to  do  this  in  the  description  of  the  combustion  of 
heterogeneous  EM.  Therefore,  the  concept  of  the  rate  control  stage  in  the  combustion  of  EM  can 
be  used  mainly  in  the  course  of  the  qualitative  analysis  of  the  process,  but  the  quantitative  models 
of  combustion  of  EM  must  be  built  with  possible  taking  into  account  all  essential  factors  charac¬ 
terizing  the  phenomenon  under  study. 

1.3.  SINGLE-STAGE  COMBUSTION  MODELS 

Greatest  difficulties  in  modeling  of  the  EM  combustion  within  the  framework  of  thermal  theory 
appear  in  description  of  different  physical  processes,  which  accompany  transformation  of  solid 


into  gas.  They  include  vaporization  of  EM,  the  foaming  of  substance  as  a  result  of  its  softening 
and  volumetric  gas  evolution,  dissolution  and  diffusion  of  reaction  gases,  dispersion  of  the  mate¬ 
rial  of  a  reaction  layer.  For  different  EM  these  processes  may  play  different  role  with  variation  in 
combustion  conditions.  The  transformation  of  the  physical  state  of  EM  in  the  combustion  wave 
leads  to  a  change  in  its  properties  (density,  thermal  conductivity,  heat  capacity)  and  this  can  be 
accompanied  by  thermal  effects.  The  dispersion  of  surface  layers  of  EM  leads  to  the  fact  that 
certain  fraction  of  condensed  phase  is  decomposed  in  the  gas  zone.  Accordingly,  this  changes  the 
thermal  effect  of  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  per  unit  of  mass  of  parent  substance.  Finally,  it 
makes  changes  in  the  wave  structure  of  combustion  and,  consequently,  in  the  burning  rate. 

Historically,  in  modeling  of  the  EM  combustion  the  approach,  which  postulated  the  governing 
role  of  the  condensed  phase  exothermal  reaction,  has  been  most  widely  used.  A  mathematical 
problem  is  usually  formulated  for  the  half-space  filled  with  the  condensed  phase.  In  the  coordi¬ 
nate  system  attached  to  the  surface  of  condensed  phase,  the  equations  of  heat-  and  of  mass  trans¬ 
fer  take  form  [25]: 

Ad2T/dx2  -  cmdT I  dx  +  pQf(rj)k0  exip(-E  /  RT)  =  0  (1.14) 

mdri/dx-pf(ri)koexp(-E/RT)=0  (1.15) 

x  — >  -  T|  — >  0,  T  — >  To;  x  =  0,  r|  =T|S,  T  =  Ts  (1.16) 

Here  r)  -  degree  of  conversion  of  the  condensed  substance  into  the  gas  depletion  extent;  p  -  den¬ 
sity  of  condensed  phase;  Q  -  thermal  effect  of  reaction  in  the  condensed  phase;  f(r|)  -  kinetic 
function,  which  considers  the  dependence  of  reaction  rate  on  the  concentration  of  the  non- 
consumed  substance;  Ts  -  surface  temperature  -  unknown  value,  which  has  to  be  determined  dur¬ 
ing  computations.  Index  s  corresponds  to  the  values  of  parameters  on  the  surface. 

From  (1.14)  the  first  integral  follows 

XdT/dx  =  qs  +  m[Q(rjs  -rj)-  c(Ts  -T)]  (1 . 17) 

Here  qs=X(dT/dx)x=o  -  heat  flux  from  gas  to  the  surface  of  condensed  phase. 

Assuming  T  and  r\  independent  variables,  let  us  exclude  x  from  equations  (1.15),  (1.17)  and  inte¬ 
grate  relationship  obtained  within  limits,  which  correspond  to  change  x  from  -°o  to  0: 

1  exp(-£  /  RT)dT  =  If  [qs  +  mQ(r\s -r\)-cm(Ts (1.18) 
m  '  J0  f  (r\) 

If  E/RTS»1,  the  preheat  layer  is  much  wider  than  the  reaction  zone,  i.e.  the  noticeable  change  in 
concentration  r)  occurs  in  a  subsurface  layer,  where  temperature  is  close  to  Ts.  Therefore  without 
significant  error  it  is  possible  to  assume  Ts-T  =  0,  under  the  integral  sign  in  the  right  hand  side  of 

(1.18),  and  the  left  integral  approximately  to  take  in  the  form: 

t. 

J exp(  -E / RT  )dT=(RT2 /E )exp(-E/RTs  )  (1.19) 

o 

Now  from  (1.18)  it  follows 

m 2  =(pX/QJ0  )(  RT2  /  E  )k0  ex p(  -E/RTS  )  (1.20) 

70  =(qs/mQ)j(dq/f(7]))  +  j(T]s -rj)(drj/ f(rj)) 

0  0 


1—9 


If  fOi)  =1-T),  then  J0=  ris+[l-ris-gs/mQ]ln(l-ris);  and  if  f(rj)  =1,  then  J0  =  (gsris/mQ)+  r|s2/2. 

In  (1.20)  m  is  expressed  through  Ts  and  r|s.  For  determining  their  values  the  additional  relation¬ 
ships  are  necessary.  One  of  them  is  the  balance  of  heat  obtained  from  (1.17)  with  x  — » (r)  — >  0, 
T  — »  To): 

Ts  =  T0  +  (Qtis/c)  +qs/mc  (1.21) 

Another  relationship  must  reflect  physical  mechanism  of  formation  of  the  surface.  In  general  case 
it  can  be  written  in  the  form  [14] 

fOls,Ts,m)  =  0  (1.22) 

Determination  of  the  concrete  form  of  the  function  f  is  one  of  the  basic  problems  of  the  combus¬ 
tion  modeling. 

Value  of  heat  flux  qs  entering  equations  for  Ts  and  J0  within  the  framework  of  single-stage  mod¬ 
els  is  not  determined,  and  for  its  finding  it  is  necessary  to  examine  processes  in  gas.  From  equa¬ 
tion  (1.13)  it  is  evident  that  the  problem  of  calculating  the  heat  flux  qs  is  reduced  to  finding  the 
expression  for  function  of  heat  evolution  <b(x)  in  the  gas  zone.  Two  theoretical  approaches  to  de¬ 
scription  of  d>(x)  are  most  widely  used.  These  are  the  model  of  narrow  reaction  zone  and  model 
with  uniform  heat-source  distribution  in  the  gas. 

In  the  case  of  the  narrow  reaction  zone  in  gas  it  is  possible  approximately  to  express  <E>(x) 
through  Dirak  8-function: 

<D(x)  =  <D°8(x-x*)  (1.23) 

where  x*  -  distance  between  surface  of  EM  and  zone  of  flame. 

Equation  (1.23),  as  shown  by  D.  B.  Spalding  [26],  is  sufficiently  accurate  approximation  for  <$(x) 
with  high  values  of  energy  of  activation. 

Substituting  (1.23)  in  (1.13),  one  obtains 

qs  =  Qm  exp(-mcx*/X)  (1-24) 

Equations  of  type  (1.24)  are  frequently  used  in  combustion  model  of  composite  solid  propellants. 
For  determining  the  value  of  x*  C.E.  Hermance  [27]  proposed  to  use  the  expression 

X  ~V  T  — - T  = -  (1-25) 

*  Pg(Tg)  [ pg(Tg)"k0cxV(-E/RTg ) 

where  vg  -  velocity  of  the  motion  of  gas  (linear),  T  -  characteristic  reaction  time.  Then  (1.24) 
gives

Spatial  variation  in  function  of  heat  evolution  <F(x)  is  determined  mainly  by  competition  between 
reduced  concentration  of  the  reagent  and  increased  reaction  rate  constant.  In  [28,  29]  an  assump¬ 
tion  has  been  made  that  the  resulting  reaction  rate  in  this  case  is  approximately  constant  up  to  a 
certain  distance  of  xi»X/mc,  measured  from  the  burning  surface  EM.  Then  from  (1.13)  it  fol¬

Joint  examination  of  equations  (1.20),  (1.22)  and  (1.27)  makes  it  possible  to  compute  mass 
burning  rate  m.  Below  we  discuss  particular  models  of  combustion  based  on  different  concepts 
about  character  of  physical  transformations  in  the  combustion  wave. 

1.3.1.  Foamy  surface  reaction  zone  with  unlimited  expansion. 

Preheating  in  the  combustion  wave  for  majority  of  solid  EM  is  accompanied  by  melting  or  sof¬ 
tening  (for  amorphous  substances)  of  their  surface  layer.  Even  during  the  combustion  of  the  typi¬ 
cal  representative  of  nonvolatile  nitroesters  -  nitrocellulose,  according  to  the  observations  of  a 
number  of  the  authors,  the  burning  surface  is  covered  with  a  liquid  layer.  The  chemical  reactions 
of  gasification  in  the  liquefied  reaction  layer  can  lead  to  the  foaming  and  as  the  result  of  this,  to  a 
change  of  the  actual  concentration  of  substance  in  the  reaction  zone.  Simultaneously  in  this  case  a 
thermal  conductivity  of  solid  is  changed  also.  The  presence  of  the  gas  bubbles  in  a  reaction  layer 
in  combustion  of  different  EM  indicated  a  number  of  the  authors,  see  for  RDX-  [30],  for  DINA  - 
[31].  In  monopropellants  on  the  basis  of  nitrocellulose  a  foamy  structure  is  reliably  observed  only 
under  the  conditions  of  thermal  decomposition  [32]  and  upon  the  combustion  in  vacuum  [33], 

Combustion  model  of  substances  with  foamy  reaction  layer  has  been  described  in  works  of  E.  I. 
Maximov  and  A.  G.  Merzhanov  [34,  35].  Similar  problems  have  been  examined  also  in  [19, 36]. 

Let  us  consider  somewhat  simplified  in  comparison  with  [34]  the  formulation  of  problem.  It  in¬ 
volves  exothermic  conversion  of  solid  EM  starting  within  the  condensed  phase  and  continuing  in 
two  phase  flow.  The  basic  assumptions  are:  heat  capacities  for  condensed  and  gas  phase  are  equal 
to  each  other;  chemical  reaction  proceeds  in  one  stage  and  has  the  first  order  on  the  concentration 
of  parent  substance;  the  characteristic  size  of  the  cells  in  dispersed  medium  is  much  lower  than 
the  width  of  the  heat  evolution  zone,  so  that  the  dispersed  zone  can  be  considered  quasi- 
homogeneous;  from  the  initial  depths  of  decomposition  the  parent  substance  and  reaction  gases 
move  with  the  identical  rates;  the  solubility  of  gaseous  products  in  the  condensed  phase  is  negli¬ 
gible. 

When  making  these  assumptions,  we  have 

d2TA/dx2  - cmdT /dx  +  p(l- ?l)Qk0 exp (-E / RT)  =  0  (1 .28) 

mdr\/dx  +  p(l-r\)k0exp(-E/RT  )  =  0  (1.29) 

Here  r\  -  degree  of  conversion  of  condensed  phase,  connected  with  the  mean  density  of  substance 
p  in  the  wave  of  combustion  via  relationship  r\  =  ( pg  /p  )-(p g  /pc ) ,  which  is  valid  if 

pc/pg»l  (indices  c  and  g  relate  to  the  condensed  and  gas  phases,  respectively);  X  -  thermal  con¬ 
ductivity  of  two-phase  medium,  defined  in  [34]  as  "weighted  mean"  value  on  Xc  and  Xg  in  accor¬ 
dance  with  their  volume  fractions;  ko,  E  -  pre-exponent  and  energy  of  the  activation  of  the  reac¬ 
tion  of  gasification  of  the  condensed  phase;  Q  -  its  thermal  effect. 

Within  the  framework  of  the  assumptions  made  a  mechanism  of  formation  of  dispersed  medium 
is  not  examined  and  expenditures  of  energy  for  formation  of  bubbles  (in  the  case  of  foam)  or  in¬ 
terface  (in  the  case  of  dispersion)  are  disregarded. 

From  physical  formulation  of  the  problem  it  is  clear  that  boundary  conditions  must  be  assigned 
only  at  ±°°: 


X  -» -oo,  T  -» To,  T1  ->  0;  X oo,  T -»  Tm,  ri ->  1.  (1.30) 

Expression  for  the  burning  rate,  obtained  by  classical  approximate  method  (according  to  Zeldo- 
vich,  Franck-Kamenetskii),  takes  form:

(1.31) 


Here  Tm  =  To+Q/c  -  combustion  temperature  in  the  absence  of  gas-phase  reactions;  p  -  pressure; 
jx  -  molar  mass. 


Dependence  of  the  burning  rate  on  pressure  v  =  dlnm/dlnp=0.5  and  on  initial  temperature  f3  = 
dlnm/dTo  =  E/2RTm2. 


For  testing  the  validity  of  adopted  assumptions  and  analysis  of  structure  of  the  combustion  wave 
the  numerical  solution  of  the  problem  (1.28)-(1.30)  has  been  carried  out  [34].  The  important  re¬ 
sult  of  numerical  calculations  became  the  conclusion  that  basic  heat  evolution  occurs  at  the  very 
low  density  of  substance,  equal  to  p  =2.5pg. 


1.3.2.  Finite  scale  foamy  reaction  layer. 

In  contrast  to  preceding  model  with  unlimited  foaming  of  condensed  phase  let  us  introduce  into 
examination  the  burning  surface  which  is  defined  as  the  end  of  the  zone  with  sharp  change  of 
density.  The  dimension  of  the  zone  is  much  smaller  than  the  width  of  the  chemical  reaction  zone. 
Thereby  we  take  into  account  the  fact  that  there  is  a  certain  limit  of  the  foaming,  on  achievement 
of  which  the  small  bubbles  disintegrate.  Let  us  allow  also  that  there  is  sufficiently  high  number  of 
small  bubbles  in  a  reaction  layer.  Then  it  is  possible  to  consider  that  through  the  foamy  stage 
virtually  entire  substance  is  passed.  It  is  known  that  the  opening  of  small  bubbles,  on  the  surface 
of  liquid  does  not  lead  to  the  generation  of  a  significant  quantity  of  drops  [37,  38];  therefore  let  us 
disregard  the  formation  of  dispersed  phase. 

Let  us  examine,  as  in  [34,  35],  combustion  of  a  hard  volatilizing  substance  under  conditions  when 
the  gas-phase  reactions  either  are  very  fast  or  occur  in  regime  of  spontaneous  ignition.  The  sys¬ 
tem  of  equations,  describing  the  propagation  of  the  combustion  wave  is  similar  to  that  given  in 
[34]: 

(  cmdT / dx  -Xd2T / dx2  )/Q  =  -mdr\/ dx  =  O  (1-32) 

<I>  =pc(l-r\)[l  +  ri pc/pg  )-v\]~1k0  exp(-E/RT )  (1  33) 

*  T)  =  0,  T  =  T0;  x  =  o,  r|  =  r\s  =  1,  T  =  Ts .  (1.34) 

Condition  r|s  =  1  indicates  complete  transformation  of  condensed  phase  into  gas,  i.e.,  the  absence 
of  dispersion,  so  that  we  will  consider  the  interface  between  foam  and  gas  as  a  burning  surface. 
Its  temperature  Ts  is  unknown  and  is  a  subject  to  determination. 

From  the  first  integral  of  equation  of  thermal  conductivity  (1.32) 

Ts  =T0  +  Qr\s/c  =  T0+Q/c  (1.35) 

it  follows  that  within  the  framework  of  the  model  under  consideration  the  value  Q  must  be  vari¬ 
able  (in  more  detail  we  discuss  experimental  proofs  of  variability  of  the  value  Q  during  combus¬ 
tion  in  section  2.7)  and  depend  at  least  on  pressure.  Let  us  formulate  this  dependence  in  general 
form 


(1.36) 


f(  Q>Ts,m)  =  0 

Solution  of  the  system  (1.32)  and  (1.33)  under  the  conditions  (1.34) 

m2  =(2Xp/Q )(  RT2  / E  )k0  exp(  -E / RTS )  (1 .37) 

Joint  examination  of  (1.35)-(1.37)  makes  it  possible  to  determine  Q,  Ts  and  m.  Function  f  in 
(1.36)  corresponds  to  a  certain  physical  condition  at  the  surface  and  must  be  determined  inde¬ 
pendently. 

Process  of  disruption  of  small  bubbles  on  the  surface  of  liquid  can  be  described  mainly  qualita¬ 
tively  [38,  39],  but  it  is  possible  to  state  that  bubble  collapse  occurs  upon  achievement  of  the 
equality  of  forces,  which  destroy  (Fp)  and  stabilize  (Fc)  small  bubble.  The  gas  pressure  applied  to 
the  "external"  surface  of  bubble’s  wall  plays  a  role  of  destroying  force:  Fp  ~  pbds2  (pressure  on  the 
"internal"  wall  applied  to  the  side  of  liquid,  is  compensated  by  the  reaction  of  liquid;  kinetic  en¬ 
ergy  of  small  bubble  we  disregard).  As  stabilizing  we  consider  the  force  of  surface  tension  Fs  ~ 
od/.  Here  pb  =  p~  +  4c/ds  -  gas  pressure  in  the  small  bubble;  pc*.  -  external  pressure;  d/  and  ds  - 
the  outer  and  inner  diameters  of  small  bubble  (Fig.  1.1);  c  -  coefficient  of  surface  tension. 


Fig.  1.1.  Small  bubble  on  the  liquid  surface. 

Taking  into  account  the  fact  that  the  thickness  of  wall  0.5(ds'-  ds)  is  usually  much  less  than  di¬ 
ameter  of  small  bubble  [39],  condition  of  the  surface  equilibrium  can  be  written  in  approximate 
form  [40]: 


Fpl  Fc  ~  pbds  /  a  ~  pxdj  a  =  const  (1.38) 

Relationship  (1.38)  can  be  written  in  another  way: 

pl!y[m(Ts  -T0)]-‘  =  const  (1.39) 

Actually,  diameter  of  separate  small  bubble  d  with  given  degree  of  the  EM  conversion  depends 
on  the  number  of  small  bubbles  N  in  section  with  this  coordinate.  This  gives  d  ~N'm.  A  change 
in  external  pressure  Pc*,  leads  to  a  change  in  the  burning  rate  m  and  value  of  the  heat  flux  q  in  the 
zone  of  foaming.  From  the  theory  of  phase  transformations  it  is  known  that  during  boiling  of  liq¬ 
uids  a  number  of  embryos  of  the  gaseous  phase  initial  spots  depends  [37]  on  the  value  of  heat 
flux  to  a  certain  extent  y  :  N~qr.  Taking  into  account  this  fact  and  also  relationship  q  =  cm(Ts-To ) 
makes  it  possible  to  reduce  (1.38)  to  the  form  (1.39).  When  writing  (1.39)  it  is  also  assumed  that 
in  the  real  range  of  variation  of  Ts  we  consider  <7  =  const.  For  the  majority  of  organic  liquids  the 
temperature  dependence  of  the  coefficient  of  surface  tension  is  low  in  value  (~104J/(m2K)),  and 
with  change  of  T  to  tens  of  degrees  a  is  changed  in  the  hundredths. 


1—13 


The  dependence  of  burning  rate  on  ambient  conditions  can  be  obtained  by  differentiating  (1.37) 
taking  into  account  (1.35)  and  (1.39).  For  m(p)  it  follows  (with  E/RTS»1  and  E(Ts-To)/RTs2  + 
2(Ts-To)/Ts»l): 

v  =  d\nm/d\n p  ~  3/y 

According  to  data  [41,  42],  y  is  close  to  3;  therefore  v  =1.  For  m(To),  when  making  reasonable 
simplifications,  it  follows 

(3  =  ( E/RT?  )/[!+( E/RT s2  )( Ts  - T0  )]  =  l/(Ts  - T0  ) 

Expression  (1.39)  is  similar  to  formula  for  r\s  obtained  in  [43]  (see  also  section  2.7)  upon  exami¬ 
nation  a  model  with  dispersion  of  a  solid  reaction  layer: 

r\s=^'p/mTs,  E,'  =  const  (1-40) 

ter  multiplying  (1.40)  by  Q'  (in  [43]  Q'  =  const)  and  designating  Q'r|s=  Q  =c(Ts-To),  we  obtain 
that  when  Ts=  const  and  y  =  3  expression  (1.40)  coincides  with  (1.39).  Expressions  for  v  and  (3  in 
the  model  in  question  and  model  [43]  are  also  identical.  This  shows  similarity  of  the  effects  of 
dispersion  and  foaming  on  the  rate  of  combustion.  At  the  same  time  it  is  necessary  to  note  that 
the  expression  (1.39)  serves  only  as  the  particular  relationship,  which  combines  heat  evolution  in 
condensed  phase  Q  ~  (Ts-To),  pressure  p  and  burning  rate  m  without  specific  relations  between 
variables. 

1.3.3.  Dispersion  of  a  liquid  reaction  layer. 

The  term  dispersion  of  EM  designates  a  phenomenon  of  mechanical  destruction  of  a  surface  re¬ 
action  layer  with  subsequent  transfer  of  particles  into  gas  zone.  Volumetric  gas  evolution  in  a  re¬ 
action  surface  layer  of  the  condensed  phase  serves  driving  force  for  dispersion  of  homogeneous 
EM.  From  the  physical  considerations  it  follows  that  for  EM  with  exothermal  reactions  in  the 
condensed  phase  dispersion  must  lead  to  the  decrease  in  heat  evolution  at  the  surface  reaction 
zone.  According  to  theoretical  analysis  [44],  the  scale  of  dispersion  can  determine  in  significant 
extent  the  level  of  the  burning  rate,  while  the  dependence  of  the  burning  rate  on  the  external  con¬ 
ditions  can  be  caused  by  the  character  of  a  change  in  the  degree  of  dispersion. 

In  principle,  there  are  possible  two  different  mechanisms  of  formation  of  the  drops  of  liquid  dur¬ 
ing  combustion  of  EM:  1)  as  a  result  of  opening  on  surface  of  separate  gas  bubbles  and  2)  as  a 
result  of  aerodynamic  interaction  of  gas  with  the  liquid  layer  during  gas  jet  outflow  from  the  sur¬ 
face  layer. 

Opening  of  the  gas  bubbles  on  a  surface,  apparently,  can  not  lead  to  significant  dispersion  of  the 
EM.  Thus,  according  to  the  analysis  [38]  of  experimental  data  on  the  yield  of  drops  from  the 
layer  of  liquid,  blown  by  gas,  no  more  than  10’4  g  of  the  drops  fits  to  each  gram  of  blowing  gas. 
The  drops  form  as  a  result  of  the  break  of  the  shells  of  small  bubbles. 

Another  picture  is  observed  in  the  case  of  jet  stream  of  gas  blowing  through  the  layer  of  liquid.  In 
this  case  the  mass  flow  rate  of  the  liquid  drops  can  become  commensurate  in  the  value  with  the 
mass  flow  rate  of  gas.  We  will  call  this  dispersion  regime  as  pneumatic  regime. 

From  physical  considerations  it  is  possible  to  state  that  the  fluid  element,  which  is  located  in  the 
surface  reaction  layer,  with  finite  probability  passes  pattern  of  chemical  transformation  (con¬ 
densed  phase  -  gaseous  products  of  pyrolysis)  as  well  as  pattern  of  mechanical  destruction  (con- 


densed  phase  -  aerosol).  The  degree  of  dispersion  (mechanical  destruction)  must  be  the  higher, 
the  faster  surface  layer  destruction  and  the  slower  chemical  transformation.  With  this  qualitative 
formulation  it  is  possible  to  give  appropriate  quantitative  form  of  description. 

We  use  expression  for  degree  of  dispersion  in  the  form  [45, 46] 

7?d  =  jJ(Pcuch+  h)  (L41) 

Numerator  in  (1.41)  represents  the  mass  flow  rate  of  aerosol,  which  is  generated  by  the  burning 
surface;  denominator  represents  an  overall  consumption  of  mass  from  the  unit  of  surface;  uCh  - 
component  of  the  "observed"  linear  burning  rate  u  due  to  the  chemical  decomposition;  pc  -  den¬ 
sity  of  the  condensed  phase.  After  dividing  numerator  and  denominator  of  (1.41)  by  the  charac¬ 
teristic  size  of  the  chemical  reaction  zone  8  (the  zone  of  the  aerosol  generation)  and  the  effective 
density  of  substance  p  we  obtain  expression  for  rid  through  the  characteristic  times  of  the  proc¬ 
esses  (Td  correspond  to  dispersion  and  xCh  -  to  chemical  decomposition): 

lid  =*7 /(*:'„+ )  (l-42) 

Dispersion  of  the  layer  8  is  connected  with  conditions  for  development  of  instability  in  liquid, 
which,  in  turn,  are  determined  by  the  forces  of  surface  tension,  and  by  characteristic  size  of  fluid 
element,  involved  in  dispersion,  as  well  as  by  inertia  factors  and  time  of  dynamic  interaction  be¬ 
tween  gas  and  liquid.  In  the  case  of  the  dispersion  of  the  EM  reaction  layer  a  significant  role,  ap¬ 
parently,  can  play  the  effect  of  collective  interaction  of  gas  jets,  since  on  the  same  fluid  element 
the  disturbances  from  different  micro-jets  of  gas  can  be  applied. 

Let  us  assume  that  an  ultimate  strain  in  the  reaction  layer,  on  achievement  of  which  the  liquid 
peptizes,  is  provided,  in  essence,  as  a  result  of  effect  of  aerodynamic  forces.  In  this  case  the  time 
of  the  achievement  of  ultimate  strain,  or  the  time  of  dispersion  Td  is  equal  to  [47] 

Td  =  %(  8/ms  )^jpc  /pg 

Here  ^'=const;  ug  -  mean  relative  gas  velocity  in  a  reaction  layer  of  thickness  8;  pg  -  mean  den¬ 
sity  of  gas.  Taking  into  account  TCh~(8/uCh)  ~  (8/ wg  )[pc/pg(Ts)],  let  us  rewrite  (1.42)  in  the  form 

TL  =(l  +  ^Pg(Ts)/pc  )~\  %  =  const  (1.43) 

From  (1.43)  one  may  derive  a  dependence  of  rid  on  p 

Tld  =1/(1+ )»  r  =  const 

Qualitatively  similar  expression  for  dependence  r|d(p)  can  be  obtained  also  from  the  examination 
of  the  balance  of  mechanical  energy  in  a  reaction  layer.  With  the  consumption  of  portion  (1-rjd) 
of  the  propellant  sample  with  an  initial  mass  mo,  the  formed  gases  acquire  kinetic  energy  W  =  (1- 
rid)moUg2/2  which  partially  can  be  spent  on  the  creation  of  the  new  interface,  i.e.  for  the  disper¬ 
sion.  The  work  of  the  formation  of  surface  with  area  E  is  equal  to  W^  =  oZ,  where  a  -  surface 
tension.  Assuming  that  the  energy  of  gases  issued  from  the  reaction  zone  is  spent  on  the  disper¬ 
sion  with  a  certain  efficiency  cp,  it  is  possible  to  write 

oE  =  tp(  1  -  r|rf  )m0u2g  / 2  (1.44) 

Here  2  -  summary  area  of  the  particles  formed  from  the  propellant  mass  ridmo.  It  is  easy  to  show 
that  rid  size  of  particles  do,  m  and  2  are  connected  as  follows: 

Hd  =Pcd0I‘/6m0  (l-45) 


1—15 


(1.46) 


From  (1.44)  and  (1.45)  we  obtain 

l/r\d=l  +  (a/(pd0)p2<l-v>, 

a  =  [M  /( pcTsRu0  )]2l2a/pc,  u0  =up~v  =  const 

From  (1.46)  it  is  evident  that  when  do  -»  0,  the  dispersion  degree  rid  ->  0.  This  means  that  the 
energy  of  the  gases  released  from  a  reaction  layer  is  insufficient  to  form  a  significant  number  of 
particles  of  very  small  sizes. 

Experimental  observations  show  that  upon  abrupt  deradiation  or  depressurization  the  subsurface 
layer  of  DB  propellants  may  destroy  with  formation  of  the  net  of  bubbles  and  small  size  particles. 
Theoretical  estimate  for  the  pressure  drop  8P,  which  may  cause  dispersion  of  liquid  layer  in  sta¬ 
tionary  and  transient  conditions  (e.g.,  under  oscillating  pressure)  has  been  made  in  Ref.  [48]. 

1.3.4.  Dispersion  of  a  solid  reaction  layer. 

Let  us  examine  combustion  of  EM  with  solid  reaction  layer  in  the  condensed  phase.  The  diagram 
of  the  substance  conversion  in  the  combustion  wave  takes  a  form  (14]

Here  A\  -  initial  condensed  substance;  Aid  -  the  same  substance  in  the  disperse  state;  A2-  gase¬ 
ous  product  of  the  reaction.  According  to  diagram  (1.47)  the  chemical  decomposition  occurs  in 
one  stage  (Ai-»A2),  which  proceeds  in  two  spatially  divided  zones:  condensed  (Aic—>  A 2)  and 
disperse  (Aid— »  A2) 

Laws  of  conservation  of  energy  and  substances,  written  in  the  coordinate  system  attached  to  the 
surface  of  condensed  phase,  take  the  form:

vcdt]/dx-k0(  I-77)  exp(-£  /  RT)  =  0  (1 .49) 

Here  A  =  z0po/pc(l-zo);  z  -  volume  fraction  of  gas  per  unit  of  volume  of  porous  (or  disperse)  me¬ 
dium;  zo  -  porosity  of  initial  specimen;  pc  -  density  of  the  condensed  substance;  po  =  |ip/RTo  - 
density  of  inert  gas  in  the  pores  in  the  initial  state;  To  -  initial  temperature;  vc  -  rate  of  the  motion 
of  the  condensed  phase;  vc  =  v0  for  unreacted  part  of  specimen;  r|  -  degree  of  conversion  of  con¬ 
densed  substance.  Additional  relationships  should  be  also  met: 


zpvg  +pc(l-z)vc  =m(  1  +  A) 

(1.50) 

Pc  (1 —  z)v  c  =  (1  -  T])m

(1.53) 

Here  p  -  gas  density;  vg  -gas  velocity;  dp  -  diameter  of  the  dispersed  particle;  po  -  viscosity  of 
gas;  ko  -  filtration  factor  of  the  gas  through  the  porous  medium. 

Relationships  (1.48)-(1.53)  compose  system  of  five  equations  (when  x>0  one  should  exclude 
equation  (1.53),  and  when  x<0  -  to  exclude  equation  (1.52))  for  six  unknowns:  T,  q,  vc,  vg,  z,  m.

Boundary  conditions  to  system  (1.48)-(1.53)  have  a  form

X  — ^  dT/dx  =  0,  q  =  1,  z  =  1. 

First  integral  of  system  (1.48)-(1.49)  makes  it  possible  to  determine  combustion  temperature  Tg, 
and  to  build  relation  between  q,  T  and  q: 

q  =  XdT  /  dx  =  cm(  1  +  A  )[(  T  -  T0  )  -  q(  Tg  -T0  )], 

Tg=T0+Q/(c(  l  +  A)]. 

For  closing  the  problem  it  is  sufficient  to  formulate  equation,  which  determines  conditions  on  the 
interface  separating  disperse  zone  and  condensed  phase. 

We  will  consider  that  on  the  interface  the  equality  of  forces  is  reached,  which  act  on  the  particles 
from  gas  flow,  Fa  and  provide  cohesion  between  particles  the  in  reaction  zone  of  condensed 
phase,  Fc.  If  dispersion  is  caused  by  destruction  of  condensed  phase  by  the  gas  flow  with  small 
Re  numbers,  i.e.  when  Re  =  (pvgd/po)x=o  <  1,  then  at  x=0 

Fd=Fc=[(nd3/6)/(l-zmz/kJ(vg-v0)]  (1.55) 

Here  the  first  factor,  isolated  with  square  brackets,  is  the  volume  of  a  single  particle;  the  second 
factor  is  the  force,  which  acts  upon  unit  volume  of  porous  medium  of  reaction  zone. 

Since  values  Fc,  z,  d  and  ko,  depend  on  degree  of  conversion  q,  condition  of  dispersion  take  the 
form 

mrjs  ~psf(ris),  f(T]s)  =  (6/mI3)(l-  z)k<t,Fc  (1.56) 

The  inequality  z0po«(l-zo)pc,  v0«(vg)s  is  taken  here  into  consideration.  From  the  qualitative 
analysis  of  problem  (1.48)-(1.54)  and  (1.56),  carried  out  in  [14],  it  follows  that  it  is  possible  to 
find  such  a  value  of  degree  of  conversion  qs°,  that  with  qs  <  qs°  the  laws  governing  the  combus¬ 
tion  are  determined  by  the  reactions  in  the  disperse  zone  (rate  control  stage  in  the  disperse  zone) 
and  when  qs  >  qs°,  they  are  determined  by  the  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  of  EM  (stage  de¬ 
tachment  regime). 

Dependence  m(p,To)  is  determined  by  the  form  of  function  f(qs)  in  (1.56)  and  by  the  value  of  qs. 
Assuming  f(qs)  =  fo  =  const  and  qs>qs°,  one  obtains 

m=( p[lf0  / RTS  )[Q/c(Ts—  T0  )],  T,*T,(T0) 

Ts  =(E/2R)/ln[(QR)3/2(Xhpck0  )1/2 /( 4p\if0c2jE  )],  ' 
v  =  dlnm/dlnp  =  l-( 2 RT2 /E )/(Ts  -  T0 ),  (1 .57) 

$  =  dlnm/dT0  =1/(TS-T0). 

If  f(r|s)  =  fo  =  const  and  qs<qs°,  itt  follows 

m  =  mrfA/l+(pj/0/md)2; , 

v  =  ^(l  +  r\2),  %  =pJ0/t](  f0ps  )2+m2, 

p  =  (l  -r\))E/RT2 

Here  mjis  the  rate  of  single-stage  combustion  of  easily  dispersed  EM  (see  section  1.31).

If  f(ris)  #  const,  then  for  the  most  important  case  r|s>r|s0  the  burning  rate  is  calculated  as  before  by 
(1.57).  The  surface  temperature  Ts  grows  with  increase  of  To,  when  dlnf/dr|s<0,  and  vice  versa: 

dTs  /dT0  =  -( 2 cRT2  /EQ  )d  In  f  /dx\. 

The  dependencies  of  the  burning  rate  on  pressure  and  initial  temperature  are  as  follows: 

v  =  1  -  (2RTS2  /  E)fi\  P  =  {TS-  T0  r1  -  (c  /  Q)d  In  /  ldrjs 
Dispersion  process  can  be  considered  in  more  detail  by  taking  into  account  the  possibility  of  solid 
material  destruction  under  action  of  deformations  due  to  strains  and  stresses  in  EM.  The  defor¬ 
mations  in  EM  can  be  caused  by  the  steep  gradient  thermal  wave  propagation  into  the  bulk  of 
material.  When  solving  the  conjugated  problem  of  the  thermal  and  mechanical  waves  propaga¬ 
tion,  one  may  study  the  effects  of  dispersion  and  stresses  on  the  ignition  and  combustion  charac¬ 
teristics  of  EM  [49-51]

CHAPTER  2 


SIMULATION  OF  MONO-  AND  DOUBLE  BASE  PROPELLANTS  COMBUSTION 

In  this  chapter  the  results  are  given  of  modeling  the  combustion  processes  of  real  homogeneous 
substances,  which  are  either  individual  chemical  compounds  -  monopropellants  (ammonium  per¬ 
chlorate,  nitramines,  etc.)  or  more  complex  objects  like  double  base  propellants  (DB),  which  con¬ 
sist  of  mixture  of  individual  substances.  Selection  of  the  objects  is  caused,  on  the  one  hand,  by 
their  practical  value  for  the  contemporary  technology,  and  on  the  other  hand,  by  the  presence  of 
the  vast  material  of  investigations  available  in  the  scientific  literature. 

2.1.  PROBLEMS  OF  THE  MODELING  THE  REACTION  ZONE  IN  THE  CONDENSED 
PHASE 

Most  of  homogeneous  energetic  materials  (EM)  of  practical  interest  transform  upon  combustion 
from  initial  solid  into  liquid  and  then  final  gaseous  products.  Therefore,  the  combustion  model  of 
such  EM  consists  typically  of  several  parts.  The  simplest  physical  pattern,  including  one¬ 
dimensional  laminar  motion  with  heat  transfer,  diffusion  and  chemical  reactions,  and  the  greatest 
progress  in  its  mathematical  simulation  (e.g.,  use  of  the  increasingly  complex  kinetics)  hold  for 
the  gaseous  part  of  the  process.  More  complex  processes  occur  in  the  solid  phase  where  in  the 
preheat  zone  some  changes  in  the  crystalline  modification  of  a  substance  are  likely  along  with  the 
cracking  caused  by  thermoelastic  stresses.  These  processes  are  sure  to  have  effect  on  the  nonsta¬ 
tionary  characteristics  of  EM  combustion.  However,  in  steady-state  conditions  their  role  is, 
probably,  small  assuming  a  thermal  combustion  mechanism.  There  is  evidence  for  the  low  inten¬ 
sity  of  solid-phase  chemical  reactions  as  compared  with  the  liquid-phase  ones  for  the  most  wide¬ 
spread  EM:  ammonium  perchlorate  [1],  octogen  and  hexogen  [2].  The  rate  control  role  in  the 
thermal  mechanism  of  EM  combustion  belongs  to  the  processes  occurring  in  the  zone  providing 
the  greatest  portion  of  heat  to  "satisfy  the  needs"  of  the  condensed  phase,  i.e.  heating  to  the  sur¬ 
face  temperature  and  all  phase  transitions.  The  authors  [1]  assume  that  at  20. ..100  atm  the  above 
zone  is  (for  ammonium  perchlorate)  the  zone  of  liquid-phase  reactions  in  which  about  70%  of  the 
needed  heat  is  released.  Conclusion  on  the  rate  control  role  of  the  gas  flame  zone  at  pressures 
below  5  atm  and  that  of  liquid-phase  reactions  at  70-90  atm  has  been  made  on  the  basis  of  ther¬ 
mocouple  measurements  of  the  temperature  profiles  in  the  combustion  wave  hexogen  and  octo¬ 
gen  [3].  The  contributions  from  both  zones  become  comparable  at  20  atm.  The  same  (compara¬ 
bility  of  contributions)  holds  for  DINA  (dinitroxydiethyl  nitramine)  at  atmospheric  pressure  [4]. 
Thus,  in  a  series  of  the  practically  important  EM,  the  effective  simulation  of  their  combustion  is 
impossible  without  describing  the  processes  occurring  in  the  zone  of  liquid-phase  reactions. 

The  importance  of  purity  of  original  EM 

The  initial  substance  purity  can  be  of  importance  in  studying  EM  combustion.  Impurities,  inevi¬ 
table  upon  production,  and  introduced  at  times  on  purpose,  behave  themselves  differently  than 
the  basic  EM  component  creating  thus  a  specific  inhomogeneity  of  composition  in  the  combus¬ 
tion  wave  of  the  initially  homogeneous  EM.  It  is  known  that  upon  combustion  of  double-base 
propellants  their  surface  zone  is  depleted  of  nitroglycerin,  which  vaporizes  and  decomposes  ear¬ 
lier  than  other  components.  On  the  contrary,  the  nonvolatile  and  almost  inert  impurities  (cata¬ 
lysts,  soot)  amounting  to  1-2%  of  the  mass  of  initial  EM  can  form  almost  solid  cover  on  its 


2—1 


burning  surface.  For  information  on  the  similar  observations  for  a  series  of  individual  and  double¬ 
base  EM,  see  [5,  6].  Known  is  the  fact  of  metal  accumulation  on  the  burning  surface  of  many 
metal -containing  compositions.  When  studying  hexogen  combustion  it  should  be  taken  in  consid¬ 
eration  that  depending  on  technology  hexogen  can  contain  up  to  10%  of  octogen.  It  is  expected 
that  even  a  smaller  portion  contained  in  the  initial  hexogen  sample  will  be  sufficient  for  the 
burning  surface  to  be  covered  with  a  liquid  layer  of  more  thermostable  (as  compared  with  hexo¬ 
gen  [7])  octogen.  To  prove  that,  one  has  to  perform  chemical  analysis  of  the  surface  layer  of  the 
extinguished  sample.  The  steady-state  combustion  rate  can  be  almost  insensitive  to  such  impuri¬ 
ties  if  the  rate  control  role  belongs  to  the  gas  phase.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  nonstationary 
combustion  characteristics  may  substantially  depend  on  the  fraction  of  impurity  in  the  initial  sub¬ 
stance. 

Density  in  two-phase  zone 

For  nonvolatile  energetic  materials  a  model  of  steady-state  combustion  with  the  rate  control  stage 
in  the  foam  zone  was  proposed  [8]  in  which  the  liquid  transforms  into  gas  due  to  the  first-order 
exothermic  reaction  and  both  of  the  phases  move  with  the  same  velocity.  No  special  conditions 
were  imposed  for  the  foam-aerosol  interface.  The  density,  transversely  averaged  to  the  motion, 
continuously  changes  from  solid  to  gas  magnitude.  The  model  proposed  in  [9-11]  is  based  on 
general  equations  for  one-dimensional  motion  of  the  two-phase  medium  (and  also  with  the 
"smeared"  burning  surface).  Additional  account  is  taken  in  [9]  (as  compared  with  [8])  of  the  pos¬ 
sible  relative  motion  of  phases  owing  to  the  Marangoni  effect,  which  drives  bubbles  "entering" 
the  burning  surface.  The  interaction  of  two  phases  and  the  character  of  their  motion  should  be 
determined  in  each  case  by  the  user.  In  particular,  two  variants  are  proposed  in  [10]. 

In  the  first  case,  the  mass  flow  rate  m*=idem  holds  over  the  entire  two-phase  region  without  av¬ 
eraging,  i.e.,  for  both  of  the  phases  separately,  so  that  ucpc  =  ugpg  =  m*.  Since  the  liquid  density 
pc  does  not  change,  uc  =  idem  holds,  i.e.,  the  liquid  moves  in  a  quasi-solid  manner.  With  ap¬ 
proach  to  the  interface,  the  gas  density  pg  decreases  owing  to  heating,  and  the  gas  velocity  in¬ 
creases.  This  variant  corresponds  to  the  jet  model  of  gas  outflow  where  the  system  of  "longitudi¬ 
nal"  pores  passing  to  the  surface  is  realized.  The  "transverse"  diffusion  instantaneously  supplies 
the  pores  with  the  gaseous  products  of  liquid  decomposition.  In  the  case  of  fairly  small  and  nu¬ 
merous  pores,  we  can  neglect  the  "transverse"  components  of  liquid  velocity.  Note  that  this  case 
is  the  more  probable,  the  higher  is  the  viscosity  and  the  closer  is  the  liquid  to  the  solid.  In  the 
second  variant  [8]  the  viscosity  completely  suppresses  the  relative  motion  of  phases.  The  condi¬ 
tion  ug=uc=m*/p  is  fulfilled,  where  p  =  pga+pc(l-a)  is  the  density  of  the  two-phase  mixture  and 
a  is  its  porosity  (volumetric  gas  fraction).  It  is  reported  [10]  that  for  nitramines  it  is  much  easier 
to  bring  the  experimental  data  into  agreement  with  the  calculations  performed  in  terms  of  the 
first-variant  model.  The  experimental  data  [12]  confirm  the  possibility  of  the  jet  regime  of  gas 
removal  from  the  reacting  layer  at  the  surface  of  some  DB  propellants  at  low  pressures.  It  is 
noteworthy  that  this  effect  could  be  favored  by  a  carbon  carcass  on  their  surface. 

The  intermediate  case  can  be  described  by  a  semi-empirical  method  [10]  using  "floating"  pa¬ 
rameter  s:  ue  =  (1-  sa)  m*/pc,  ug  =  (1-  sa+s)  m*/pg..  In  particular,  with  s— the  limiting  case 
of  the  spontaneous  "longitudinal"  removal  of  the  gas  from  liquid  to  surface  is  realized.  A  very 
fast  removal  of  dissolved  gas  is  possible  not  only  by  bubbles,  but  also  by  diffusion  from  a  fairly 
thin  liquid  film.  In  this  extreme  case,  we  get  ug— >  °°  .  Since  the  mass  gas  flow  is  of  finite  value 


and  at  depth  x  it  is  equal  to  pgug  a  =  wdx  (w  being  the  mass  velocity  of  gas  formation  in  liq- 

£5  O 

uid),  a  — »  0.  Thus,  we  get  p  =  pc.  Note  that  the  linear  liquid  velocity  in  this  case  decreases  with 

f°° 

approach  to  the  surface.  In  the  stationary  case,  we  have  pcuc.=  m*-  wdx.  In  [13,14]  the  prob- 

JJC 

lem  statement  corresponds  to  the  case  where  the  gaseous  products  of  liquid  decomposition  are 
dissolved  in  liquid  and  transferred  without  changing  its  density.  These  concepts  hold  only  for  the 
small  degrees  of  decomposition. 

Subsurface  vaporization 

Studying  combustion  of  vaporizing  EM,  one  should  take  into  account  phase  transitions  over  all 
interfaces  including  those  of  bubbles  and  droplets.  In  [10]  for  a  droplet  zone  and  in  [15,  16]  for 
the  entire  two-phase  zone  the  equation  is  used  for  the  non-equilibrium  mass  velocity  of  vaporiza¬ 
tion  from  the  unit  area  of  interface 

m*  =  Pg.uV(T)/p  -  nv]  (2.1) 

where  pg.u^  is  the  mass  flow  rate  of  the  vapor  molecules  per  unit  area  of  interface,  pv(T)  is  the 
equilibrium  pressure  of  saturated  vapor,  nv  is  the  mole  fraction  of  vapor  above  the  surface.  Using 
of  (2.1)  at  temperature  close  to  the  boiling  point  is  methodically  incorrect.  Indeed,  since  u^  is  of 
the  order  of  sound  velocity,  the  deviation  of  the  relative  partial  pressure  from  its  equilibrium 
value  pv(T)/p  -  nv  =  m*/pgui  is  of  the  order  of  the  Mach  number.  In  deflagration  problems,  this 
value  is  much  smaller  than  unity  and  thus,  the  vapor  pressure  can  be  considered  to  be  equilib¬ 
rium.  Taking  into  account  this  small  deviation  may  cause  only  small  changes  in  the  model.  In 
other  words,  in  the  calculation  procedure,  Eq.  (2.1)  should  not  play  the  role  of  the  key  relation  for 
calculating  m*  (the  equation  "resists"  this  by  giving  a  great  error  at  small  relative  errors  in  sub¬ 
stituted  values).  As  in  the  case  of  neglecting  this  correction,  the  equation  should  relate  the  values 
T,  p,  and  nv.  To  this  end,  it  should  be  used  in  the  form:  pv(T)/p  =  nv  +  m*/pgu'1'. 

The  peculiarities  of  heat  transfer  through  the  bubbles 

In  all  available  papers,  heat  transfer  in  the  foam  is  considered  using  the  expression  for  the  "effec¬ 
tive"  coefficient  of  thermal  conductivity  constructed  in  terms  of  additivity  similarly  to  the  expres¬ 
sion  for  density  and  capacity:  A  =  (1-  a)  Ac  +  a  Xg.  It  holds  for  the  Xc  value  comparable  or  ex¬ 
ceeding  Ag.  However,  in  the  case  of  strong  vaporization  into  bubbles,  the  heat  transfer  does  not 
follow  the  Fourier  mechanism.  It  can  be  demonstrated  that  each  bubble  with  strong  vaporization 
into  it  is  a  miniature  heat  tube.  According  to  [17,18],  the  effective  thermal  conductivity  of  heat 
tubes  with  vaporization  and  condensation  can  be  1000  times  greater  than  that  of  gold.  In  this  case 
more  suitable  is  the  "relay-race"  model  of  thermal  conductivity  of  mechanical  mixture  1/X  =  (1- 
a)/Xc  +  aJX\).  Here  A*  is  the  effective  thermal  conductivity  of  bubble.  Assuming  that  Ab  »  Ac,  we 
get  A  =  Ac/(1-  a). 

Account  of  a  solubility  of  gaseous  decomposition  products 

Probably,  this  effect  has  been  first  taken  into  account  in  the  model  of  homogeneous  EM  combus¬ 
tion  [19].  According  to  the  existing  at  that  time  notions  of  the  high  degree  of  burning  EM  disper¬ 
sion,  it  was  assumed  that  the  burning  surface  (actually,  dispersion  surface)  is  located  at  the  place 
where  the  solubility  limit  of  the  gaseous  products  of  liquid  decomposition  is  reached.  Attainment 


of  an  equilibrium-like  condition  at  the  burning  surface  as  a  possible  triggering  event  for  disper¬ 
sion  was  later  stated  in  Ref.  20. 

Let  us  consider  the  appearance  of  the  gas  bubbles  in  a  reaction  layer  of  the  condensed  phase  dur¬ 
ing  EM  combustion  as  sufficient  condition  to  form  the  burning  surface.  In  order  to  analyze  the 
effect  of  solubility  in  the  “pure”  form,  we  also  assume  that  the  rate  control  stage  is  located  in  the 
reaction  zone  of  condensed  phase.  After  designating  concentration  of  dissolved  gases  as  a,  the 
condition  of  the  surface  forming  can  be  written  in  the  form  x  =  0,  a  =  as,  where  as  -  maximum 
(under  given  conditions)  solubility.  Heat  released  during  decomposition  of  the  condensed  phase 
is  consumed  on  the  warm-up  of  the  fresh  EM  from  initial  temperature  To  to  the  surface  tempera¬ 
ture  Ts.  In  Ref.  [19],  the  analysis  of  the  laws  governing  the  combustion  is  carried  out  under  the 
assumption  that 

c(Ts  -T0)  -  £as  (2.2) 

where  as  depends  exponentially  on  Ts  and  linearly  on  pressure  p: 

as~p  exp  ( L/RTS )  (2.3) 

Here  L  -  heat  of  solution;  8-  proportionality  factor. 

Substituting  (2.3)  in  (2.2),  we  obtain  equation  for  Ts 

nc(Ts-T0)  =  p  exp(  L/RTS ),  n  =  const. 

Value  of  the  surface  temperature  Ts  uniquely  determines  the  burning  rate  in  the  combustion 
model  with  the  rate  controlling  condensed  phase  reactions.  In  this  case 

v  =  d In u / d In p  =  /3(TS  - T0 ),  /3  =  d\nu/dlnT0=(E/ 2RT* ) /(I  +  A), 

A  =  (L/RT?)(TS-T0)  (2.4) 

If  A»  1,  then  v  =  E/2L,  /3  =  v/(Ts -T0). 

In  more  general  formulation  of  the  problem  the  effect  of  solubility  of  gaseous  products  on  the 
laws  governing  combustion  was  investigated  by  numerical  method  [21].  The  location  of  the  rate 
control  zone  was  not  preliminary  assigned  in  this  case.  From  the  results  of  the  numerical  analysis 
of  the  problem  it  followed  that  approach  presented  above  is  valid  only  with  a  comparatively  high 
solubility  and  the  high  magnitude  of  the  heat  of  solution  (L  >  E/2,  E  -  energy  of  activation  of  the 
decomposition  of  the  condensed  phase).  In  all  remaining  cases  a  two-phase  zone  (aerosol  or 
foam)  is  the  burning  rate  control  stage.  More  precise  consideration  should  take  into  account  the 
possibility  of  liquid  super-saturation  by  dissolved  gas  at  high  speed  of  the  increase  of  its  concen¬ 
tration.  The  nonstationary  variant  of  the  model  was  also  discussed  [22]. 

Necessity  of  considering  the  dissolved  products  diffusion. 

It  is  expected  that  in  some  region  of  variations  in  EM  parameters  and  external  conditions,  the 
combustion  regimes  are  possible  in  which  the  gaseous  product  of  liquid  decomposition  dissolved 
in  the  liquid  is  removed  to  the  burning  surface  by  molecular  diffusion  without  forming  any  bub¬ 
bles  so  that  the  product  concentration  profile  is  formed  with  a  maximum  inside  the  liquid  layer.  It 
is  known  that  in  liquids,  the  diffusion  coefficient  Dc  positively  depends  on  temperature.  In  this 
particular  case,  Dc  is  very  small  and  diffusion  provides  the  effective  removal  of  dissolved  gas 
only  from  a  fairly  thin  liquid  film.  In  experiment  [23]  no  bubbles  were  observed  to  form  in  the 
polymer  film  on  the  surface  of  the  metallic  disc  heated  to  430°C  if  the  film  thickness  did  not  ex¬ 
ceed  10-20  |i.  Since  the  zone  thickness  of  the  liquid-phase  reactions  of  burning  EM  can  be  of  this 
order  of  magnitude,  the  combustion  regime  with  the  diffusion  removal  of  gas  is  quite  possible.  In 


2—4 


[23],  for  the  bubble  nuclei,  it  is  assumed  that  d  =  30A°.  The  dissolved  gas  molecules  have  d  =  3-5 
A0  [24].  Therefore,  the  molecules  diffuse  and  are  removed  from  the  surface  much  more  rapidly 
than  the  bubbles.  In  other  words,  a  sufficiently  effective  diffusion  does  not  remove  bubble  nuclei 
from  the  film.  It  just  eliminates  the  cause  of  their  appearance. 

Let  us  find  out  how  the  above  possible  absence  of  bubbles  in  the  liquid-phase  zone  with  thickness 
x*  depends  on  pressure.  The  time  of  the  diffusion  removal  (with  diffusion  coefficient  D)  of  the 
dissolved  gaseous  reaction  products  (x*)2/D  must  be  shorter  than  the  residence  time  of  reacting 
liquid  in  this  zone  (x*/Uc).  So  that  the  condition  for  the  absence  of  bubbles  is  D(TS)  >  x*uc .  Let 
us  estimate  the  pressure-dependence  of  both  of  the  inequality  sides.  We  use  the  above  D(T)  - 
exp(-Eo/RT)  and  the  Clayperon-Clausius  relation  on  the  surface  exp(-pL/RTs)  -  p,  where  |iL  is 
the  thermal  effect  of  vaporization,  cal/(mol  K).  Then,  we  get  D(TS)  ~  pa,  a  =  Ep/pL  .  For  EM  of 
the  hexogen  and  octogen  type,  pL  ~  (20-30)  103  cal/mol.  The  ED  value  was  experimentally  ob¬ 
tained  to  be  about  14500  cal/mol  for  oxygen  diffusion  in  polyvinylacetate  [24].  Since  size  d  of 
the  molecules  of  the  gaseous  products  of  initial  decomposition  is  greater  than  that  of  oxygen  and 
the  condition  ED  ~  d2  is  satisfied,  it  is  stated  that  D(TS)  has  the  exponential  positive  dependence 
on  P  with  index  a  >  0.5.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  ucx*  value  logarithmically  depends  on  pressure. 
Since  the  exponential  dependence  at  large  arguments  is  stronger,  it  is  concluded  that  no  bubbles 
can  be  observed  at  fairly  high  pressure. 

Bubbles,  their  evolution  and  interaction 

When  the  dissolved  product  concentration  exceeds  the  limiting  one,  the  gas  bubbles  arise 
within  the  liquid-phase  reaction  zone  that  violates  the  one-dimensionality  pattern.  Owing  to 
the  inevitable  concentration  inhomogeneities,  the  nuclei  appear  discretely  rather  than  uni¬ 
formly  on  some  plane.  In  this  case,  the  diffusion  carries  away  the  dissolved  intermediate 
product  to  the  bubble,  decreasing  thus  the  saturation  degree  and  preventing  the  appearance 
of  close  neighbours. 

Let  us  discuss  the  evolution  of  bubbles  and  the  possibility  and  ways  of  local  averaging  of  vari¬ 
ables  over  space  and  time.  In  the  burning  foam  there  is  a  size-distribution  of  bubbles,  because  the 
appearance  of  large  bubbles  is  followed  by  the  appearance  of  the  small  ones.  The  initial  reason 
for  both  of  the  processes  is  gasification  (chemical  decomposition  of  liquid  and  its  vaporization). 
Examining  the  liquid  element  with  bubbles,  it  is  easily  envisioned  that  the  bubbles  grow  with 
gasification  conserving  their  shape  and  number  until  coming  into  contact  with  the  neighbouring 
bubbles.  Thereafter,  the  two-phase  medium  becomes  the  multiple  foam.  The  further  ingress  of 
gas  with  conservation  of  the  number  of  bubbles  causes  their  elongation  along  the  normal  to  the 
burning  surface,  which  contradicts  the  principle  of  surface  energy  minimum.  This  principle 
makes  the  bubbles  join.  Appearance  of  the  new  small  bubbles  between  the  large  ones  is  related  to 
the  rise  in  temperature  of  the  foam  element  approaching  the  surface.  The  temperature  rises  due  to 
exothermic  reaction  and  heat  supply  from  the  flame.  In  this  case,  the  gas  formation  rate  increases 
in  the  "Plateau  channels",  i.e.,  the  most  thick  liquid  formations  between  the  bubbles.  Their  thick¬ 
ness,  which  at  smaller  reaction  rate  allowed  one  to  remove  the  gaseous  reaction  products  by  dif¬ 
fusion  to  the  neighboring  bubbles,  is  now  excessive  and  the  new  bubbles  arise  in  the  "channels". 
The  above  arguments  assume  the  foam  motion  and  swelling  according  to  [8]  without  pronounced 
interface  movements,  which  is  typical  of  the  "true"  multi-layer  foam  with  a  relatively  small  tem¬ 
perature  drop  on  each  bubble.  When  the  bubble  size  is  comparable  with  that  of  the  entire  reaction 


2—5 


zone,  this  distorts  the  bubble  form  and  becomes  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  relative  motion  of 
phases.  The  matter  is  that  the  liquid  viscosity  |X  and  surface  tension  o  are  temperature-dependent. 
The  Marangoni  effect  is  known,  i.e.,  the  motion  of  a  bubble  toward  decreasing  a.  When  a  does 
not  noticeably  change  along  the  bubble  surface,  this  motion  can  occur  without  changing  its  form. 
In  the  case  of  a  change,  the  bubble  will  become  pear-shaped  in  accordance  with  the  Laplace  for¬ 
mula.  When  p.  also  noticeably  changes  along  the  bubble  surface,  it  will  expand  toward  lower  vis¬ 
cosity  with  further  ingress  of  gas,  i.e.,  the  elongated  end  of  the  "pear"  will  move  faster  to  the 
burning  surface.  This  case  resembles  the  jet  regime  and  differs  from  it  by  the  impulsive  behavior 
of  the  elongated  bursting  bubbles. 

Bubble-induced  mixing 

At  the  "hot"  boundary  of  the  foam,  each  bubble  is  eventually  destroyed.  This  is  followed  by  the 
liquid  pulsations,  i.e.  fast  local  movements  of  the  environment  occupying  under  surface  tension  a 
free  place  with  a  scale  of  the  order  of  the  diameter  of  the  burst  bubble.  Thus,  the  bursting  bubbles 
can  mix  the  foam.  The  second  reason  for  mixing  is  the  motion  of  bubbles  to  the  surface  under  the 
Marangoni  effect  (see  [25])  and  the  Archimedes  force.  In  this  case,  the  presence  of  bubbles  of 
different  size  considerably  enhances  the  mixing  which  sharply  intensifies  the  heat-  and  mass- 
transfer.  In  particular,  the  convective  diffusion  can  remove  the  liquid-dissolved  gas  from  the  re¬ 
action  zone  more  effectively  that  restricts  the  bubble  formation  and  growth.  The  above  arguments 
are  concerned  with  a  homogeneous  monopropellant.  Similarly  to  [26],  it  is  established  that  the 
passage  of  any  inhomogeneity  to  the  melting  surface  favors  either  the  appearance  or  intensifica¬ 
tion  of  turbulence  in  the  liquid-phase  reaction  zone.  The  visual  observations  [6]  have  revealed 
convection  in  the  melted  layer  of  the  burning  DINA,  namely  the  laminar  one  in  the  transparent 
part  of  the  layer  close  to  the  solid  phase  and  the  turbulent  one  in  its  nontransparent  subsurface 
part.  In  [6],  the  bubble  size  was  smaller  than  the  size  of  mixing  zones  and  thus,  the  use  of  the 
continual  approach  became  possible.  Transition  to  more  infusible  EM  (octogen)  and  high  pres¬ 
sures  allows  one  to  eliminate  the  dependence  of  combustion  characteristics  on  the  orientation  of 
the  burning  surface  relative  to  gravity.  In  this  case,  however,  there  are  some  problems  with 
simulation  due  to  poor  foundation  of  the  continual  approach.  An  increase  in  pressure  leads  to  a 
substantial  decrease  in  bubble  size  Rb  because  the  size  of  the  liquid-phase  reaction  zones  de¬ 
creases  by  an  order  of  magnitude  upon  transition  to  pressures  of  tens  of  atm.  As  Rb  decreases,  the 
components  of  bubble  velocity  also  decrease  under  the  Marangoni  (-Rb)  and  Archimedes  (~Rb2) 
forces.  Since  the  intensity  of  bubble  removal  relative  to  the  liquid  decreases  near  the  surface,  the 
bubbles  just  grow  and  burst.  The  case  is  realized  where  the  linear  velocity  of  bubble  increase  is 
much  higher  than  that  of  burning  (the  velocities  of  bubble  transfer  by  liquid  in  the  system  con¬ 
nected  to  the  burning  surface)  so  that  no  followers  are  formed  during  bubble  lifetime;  the  “one- 
layer”  foam  is  realized.  In  this  case,  the  greatest  bubble  size  is  of  the  order  of  the  reaction  zone 
thickness  and  the  question  arises  of  the  validity  of  the  continual  approach.  In  a  similar  case  for 
AP,  it  was  used,  with  certain  limitations,  the  one-dimensional  stationary  approach  and  was  ob¬ 
tained  the  efficient  combustion  model  neglecting  even  bubbles.  The  same  was  realized  in  [10]:  a 
one-dimensional  model  was  used  mentioning,  however,  that  the  bubble  size  can  be  of  the  order  of 
the  two-phase  zone  thickness. 

Estimation  of  mixing 

Let  us  assume  that  the  general  pattern  on  the  surface  differs  in  different  sites  only  by  a  shift  in 
time  from  that  on  a  particular  region  (circle,  square)  with  a  typical  size  equal  to  the  diameter  of  a 


2—6 


bursting  bubble.  It  is  suggested  that  for  above  reasons,  this  bubble  has  grown  only  toward  the 
burning  surface  so  that  the  babble  diameter  coincides  with  distance  x  from  the  burning  surface  to 
the  place  of  bubble  origin.  In  this  case,  we  have  neglected  the  relative  size  of  the  bubble  part 
"protruding"  above  the  surface.  Since  the  diffusion  coefficient  can  be  interpreted  as  a  ratio  of  pul¬ 
sation  size  square  and  its  period,  we  get  Dc  ~  x 2/t .  The  pulsation  frequency  tA  is  given  as  a  ratio 
of  the  second  volumetric  gas  flow  rate  through  the  region  under  study  (area  ~x 2)  to  the  bubble 
volume  ~x3,  tA  ~x2V / x3  ~  V  lx,  where  V  is  the  volumetric  gas  flow  rate  (bubbles)  per  1  cm2 
of  the  surface,  cm/s.  Consequently,  we  get  Dc~x  V  .  The  dependence  of  Dc  on  the  coordinate  can 
be  taken  into  account  by  introducing,  e.g.,  a  decrease  of  Dc  to  0  at  a  distance  x .  It  is  interesting  to 
compare  the  convective  additive  to  the  Dc  transfer  coefficient  with  the  "molecular"  temperature 
diffusivity  of  the  liquid  phase  (X/cp)0  «  0.001  cm2/s.  When  the  reaction  is  effective  enough,  the  V 
value  is  the  product  of  the  linear  velocity  of  gas  flow  from  the  surface  by  the  depth  of  subsurface 
decomposition.  According  to  [11],  for  hexogen  or  octogen,  this  can  give  several  tens  of  cm/s  at 
atmospheric  pressure.  If  in  this  case,  thickness  x  is  of  the  order  of  10  |im,  then  on  the  surface  the 
convective  thermal  conductivity  caused  by  bursting  bubbles,  is  tens  times  more  effective  than  the 
molecular  thermal  conductivity.  However,  as  the  pressure  rises,  x  and  V  decrease  with  the  effi¬ 
ciency  of  heat  removal  from  the  zone  of  liquid-phase  reactions.  As  a  result,  at  high  pressures,  the 
temperature  maximum  is  likely  to  arise  in  the  liquid-phase  reaction  zone,  which  causes  instability 
[14]. 

Equilibrium  conditions  on  the  surface. 

In  the  case  of  multicomponent  mixture  of  liquid  components  the  equality  takes  place  on  the  sur¬ 
face  of  the  chemical  potentials  or  the  fugacity/of  the  both  phases  for  each  component  [28]. 

ft,g  =  P  =  fi,iu};  fmq=Yixi,uqPiM<,'’  2>U  =1’  (2-5) 


Here  Xj>g  and  Xj,uq  are  the  molar  fractions  of  components  near  interface  from  the  side  of  gas  and 
liquid,  respectively;  <p  and  y  are  the  coefficients  of  fugacity  and  activity  related  to  the  non¬ 
ideality  of  gas  mixtures  and  solutions.  Deviation  of  the  values  for  coefficients  (p  and  y  of  unity 
can  be  essential  under  conditions  of  high  pressures  and  low  temperatures.  For  simplicity,  one 
may  take  cp  =  y  =  1.  Further,  one  may  also  assume  that  the  pressure  in  the  liquid  approximately 
equals  the  pressure  of  saturated  vapor  of  its  component  and  can  be  calculated  by  pi;uq  ~  Bj  exp(L/ 
RT).  It  means  that  we  neglect  the  energy  expenses  on  formation  of  gas  nuclei  in  a  liquid  layer  as 
well  as  contribution  of  the  recoil  force  applied  to  the  liquid  surface.  The  equation  of  mechanical 
equilibrium  for  the  liquid  surface  is  derived  from  Eq.2.5: 

Strong  dependence  of  pi,iiq  on  temperature  makes  it  possible  to  neglect  by  all  terms  in  the  left 
hand  side  of  expression  2.6,  excepting  the  main  one  that  corresponds  to  the  component  with  the 
highest  boiling  temperature.  Note  that  when  pressure  changes,  the  boiling  temperature  changes  as 
well.  Regarding  the  pressure  dependence,  the  component’s  temperature  order  may  change  by 
places.  Therefore,  changing  pressure  can  lead  to  changing  the  component  in  the  liquid  mixture, 
which  determines  the  mixture  boiling  point.

Let  we  demonstrate  how  to  use  expression  (2.5)  in  the  case  of  two-component  system.  If  the 
closed  vessel  is  partially  filled  with  two-component  mixture  having  molar  fractions  Xi,uq  and  x^uq 
=  1-xi.uq,  the  gas  phase  easily  reaches  equilibrium  in  the  form: 

Xl,g  P  =  ^l.liq  Pl.liq  >  ^2,g  P  =  ^2,liq  p2,Iiq  ■>  (2*5^ 

Further,  let  the  vessel  becomes  open  and  the  gas  mixture  with  another  parameters  p',  x'iig  and  x^.g 
starts  to  flow  above  the  liquid  surface.  Obviously,  the  parameters  of  the  components  inside  thin 
subsurface  liquid  layer  begin  to  adjust  to  the  gas  parameters  and  process  of  re-arrangement  of 
temperature  and  concentration  profiles  will  propagate  into  the  bulk  of  liquid.  The  speed  of  this 
process  can  be  significantly  enhanced  by  the  convection.  During  the  process  an  “excessive”  com¬ 
ponent  is  delivered  to  the  surface  and  evaporated  while  “deficient”  one  is  condensed  from  the  gas 
phase  and  transported  into  the  bulk  of  the  material.  It  has  been  proposed  in  Ref.  [29]  that  above 
mechanism  provides  decrease  in  the  volume  content  of  easy  volatile  components  in  subsurface 
layer  of  multi-component  liquid  drops  suspended  in  the  hot  gas  stream.  This  leads  to  overheating 
the  central  core  of  drop  that  may  cause  experimentally  observed  burst  of  drops  in  gas  streams. 

Similar  phenomena  can  occur  in  combustion  of  molten  energetic  materials  but  in  this  case  sta¬ 
tionary  waves  of  the  liquid  parameters  variation  can  be  observed.  Here  in  the  contrast  with  above 
case  the  reason  for  permanent  difference  between  parameters  of  gas  and  liquid  component  on  dif¬ 
ferent  sides  of  interface  is  the  flame  reactions  and  corresponding  heat  and  mass  feedback  to  the 
burning  surface.  Note  that  for  some  easily  melted  energetic  materials  the  processes  in  thick  liquid 
layer  can  be  accompanied  by  macro-scale  convection  [4]. 

It  should  be  underlined  that  expression  (2.5)  can  be  also  written  in  different  of  relation  (2.6)  form, 
namely  [30]: 

'Zxi,uqPi,uq  =  P  (2-7) 

It  is  convenient  to  use  that  expression  when  the  values  of  x^q  are  a  priori  known,  e.g.,  if  there  is 
no  reactions  and  diffusion  in  subsurface  layer.  However,  it  is  doubtful  using  (2.7)  in  real  situation 
with  the  presence  of  chemical  and  physical  processes.  In  addition,  use  of  (2.7)  is  difficult  in  the 
case  of  mixture  with  most  easy  volatile  components.  In  calculations  it  leads  to  uncertainty  of  0  x 
°o  type  resulting  in  large  computational  error.  Note  that  the  use  of  expression  (2.6)  instead  of 
(2.7)  gives  advantage  in  case  of  rate  control  gas  phase  reactions  when  the  reactions  within  the 
liquid  diffusion  zone  (0,  Zd)  can  be  neglected.  If  one  assumes  additionally  that  this  zone  is  rela¬ 
tively  thin  (diffusion  relaxation  time  td  =  Zd/u  less  than  the  thermal  relaxation  time  tth=^c/cpcu2), 
the  processes  in  the  condensed  phase  can  be  treated  without  taking  into  account  change  in  the 
heat  and  species  fluxes  across  the  liquid  diffusion  zone.  In  the  gas  phase,  the  values  of  Xjig  can  be 
found  from  the  solution  of  the  problem  describing  reactions,  diffusion  and  heat  propagation  in  the 
region  z  <  0.  As  the  boundary  conditions  one  may  use  the  heat  balance  at  the  surface  (z  =  0) 

-  X '  1ST  ^  °) : = it (+  0)  +  (+  0)C'  (2'8) 

and  mass  fluxes  balance  (z  =  0) 

-  mxtig  (-  0)  -  Dg  (-  0)  =  ~mxi  liq  (+  0)  (2.9)

Here  m  is  the  mass  flow  rate  and  Q,  is  the  heat  of  gasification,  which  is  closed  to  the  experimen¬ 
tal  value  of  evaporation  heat.  Detailed  expressions  in  the  form  of  (2.5)  are  not  needed  now  be¬ 
cause  in  the  thin  liquid  diffusion  zone  the  components  ratio  practically  does  not  change  and  to 
close  the  problem  formulation  one  needs  only  to  calculate  the  vapor  pressure  for  component  with 
the  highest  boiling  temperature. 

Equations  (2.8)  and  (2.9)  do  not  include  terms  with  heterogeneous  heat  release  and  multi- 
component  diffusion,  which  may  become  important  for  the  gas  mixture  with  strong  difference  in 
component’s  molecular  mass.  In  the  condensed  phase,  the  problem  is  considered  for  the  heat 
propagation  without  diffusion.  If  it  turns  out  that  the  effects  of  the  reactions  and  thermal  relaxa¬ 
tion  in  a  liquid  diffusion  layer  could  not  be  neglected,  the  problem  formulation  has  to  be  ex¬ 
tended.  In  this  case  equation  (2.9)  takes  the  form 


0jc 

~mxi,g  (-0)  -  Dt  (-0)  =  -m*u,  (+0)  (2.10) 

and  expression  (2.5)  should  be  included  in  the  problem  formulation.

2.2  COMBUSTION  OF  NITRAMINES 


2.2.1  Thermal  decomposition  kinetics. 

Nitramines  have  been  used  as  explosives  in  mining,  artillery,  and  engineering  over  a  long  period 
of  time.  In  the  last  two  decades,  considerable  interest  in  nitramines  has  been  expressed  by  the  de¬ 
velopers  of  propellant  compositions  for  gun  systems  and  rocket  motors,  i.e.  solid  propellants 
(SP).  As  SP  component,  nitramines  have  a  number  of  useful  properties,  such  as  high  density,  high 
combustion  temperature,  and  weak  radiation  absorption  by  the  combustion  products.  Because  of 
new  practical  demands,  recent  studies  have  been  directed  to  the  detailed  mechanism  of  thermal 
decomposition  at  various  heating  rates,  including  rates  comparable  with  the  heating  rate  of  a  sub¬ 
stance  in  a  combustion  wave.  This  required  a  serious  effort  to  develop  effective  methods  of  ki¬ 
netic  studies.  As  a  result,  considerable  progress  toward  an  understanding  of  the  chemical  mecha¬ 
nism  of  nitramine  decomposition  and  combustion  has  been  achieved.  It  should  be  mentioned  that 
the  relative  simplicity  of  the  chemical  structure  of  nitramines  compared  with  other  monopropel¬ 
lants  (substances  that  are  capable  of  burning  independently  in  an  inert  medium)  was  a  reason  for 
the  considerable  interest  in  the  basic  investigation  of  their  chemical  transformations.  However, 
because  of  significant  technical  difficulties,  the  thermal  decomposition  of  nitramines  has  not  yet 
been  clearly  understood,  and  the  work  along  this  line  is  underway. 

The  great  body  of  available  information  requires  generalization  and  analysis.  Such  work  was 
partially  carried  out  in  [1-3].  However,  since  the  publication  of  these  papers,  a  considerable  body 
of  new  data  has  been  obtained.  Therefore,  it  is  justified  an  attempt  to  give  a  survey  of  the  state- 
of-the-art  in  studies  of  the  thermal-decomposition  kinetics  of  nitramines.  As  the  subject,  we  chose 
the  cyclic  nitramines  that  have  been  most  widely  used  in  practice:  RDX  (cyclotrimethylenetrini- 
tramine)  and  HMX  (cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine). 


Physical  properties

Here  AH°f  is  the  enthalpy  of  formation  at  298  K,  kcal/mol;  Qm  is  the  heat  of  melting,  kcal/mole;

is  the  heat  capacity  of  the  liquid  phase,  cal/(g  K);  cP)S  -  heat  capacity  of  the  condensed  phase, 
cal/(g  K);  and  Xs  is  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  condensed  phase,  cal/(cm  sec  K).  Evidently, 


the  enthalpies  of  formation  have  the  widest  scattering,  since  their  determination  requires  very  ac¬ 
curate  measurements. 

Temperature  dependencies  for  the  heat  capacities  of  the  condensed  and  liquid  phases  of  RDX  are 
given:  cP)S  =  0.0389  +  0.0007  T  [11],  cP)S  =  0.235  +  0.00068(T-273)  [12];  cp,i  =  0.258  + 
0.00086(T-273)  [12], 

We  assume  that  the  surface  evaporation  of  pure  nitramine  obeys  the  Clausius— Clapeyron  law  in 
the  form  log  ps  =  A  -  L/(4.575  Ts),  where  A  =  const ,  ps  is  the  equilibrium  vapor  pressure  above 
the  surface  of  the  substance,  L  is  the  latent  heat  of  sublimation  (or  evaporation  at  Ts  >  Tm  ),  and 
Ts  is  the  surface  temperature.  The  phase-transition  temperatures  are  related  by  [13] 

Lsubl  =  Lm  "I"  LVaP  (2.11) 

Experimental  determination  of  ps  over  a  wide  temperature  range  involves  fundamental  technical 
difficulties  because  of  the  intense  decomposition  of  nitramines  at  elevated  temperature.  The 
quantity  Lsubi  can  be  determined  most  reliably,  and  the  quantity  Lvap  can  be  estimated  by  Eq. 
(2.11).  In  this  case,  one  should  bear  in  mind  that,  at  a  high  surface  temperature,  the  thermal- 
decomposition  products  dissolved  in  the  melted  layer  decrease  the  nitramine-vapor  pressure. 
Hence  it  follows  that  the  heat  of  evaporation  at  temperatures  close  to  the  boiling  point  cannot  be 
determined  with  high  accuracy,  and  this  is  actually  evidenced  by  the  data  in  Table  2.2. 

Note  that  one  of  the  world’s  first  studies  [14]  on  determination  of  the  heats  of  evaporation  of  ex¬ 
plosives  was  reported  by  A.  F.  Belyaev  in  1940.  In  a  more  recent  paper  [15],  he  reported  that  the 
most  probable  heat  of  evaporation  and  boiling  point  (p  =  1  atm)  for  RDX  are  equal  to  26  kcal/mol 
and  340  °C,  respectively,  but  remarked  that  these  data  are  not  sufficiently  reliable.  In  the  accu¬ 
rately  performed  investigation  of  Maksimov  et  al.  [16],  it  was  established  that  Tb  =  664  ±  33  K 
(Tb  is  the  boiling  point)  and  Lvap  =  22.5  ±  0.5  kcal/mol  for  RDX  and  Tb  =  744  ±  37  K  and  Lvap  = 
27.6  ±  1  kcal/mol  for  HMX. 

HMX  is  known  to  have  four  polymorphic  solid-state  modifications:  a,  (3,  y,  and  8  [2],  which  are 
stable  at  T=  115  -  156,  20  -  115,  ~  156,  and  170  -  279  °C,  respectively.  The  densities  of  the  cor¬ 
responding  HMX  modifications  are  given  in  Table  2.3.

The  thermodynamic  parameters  of  the  phase  transition  of  HMX  (3-4  5  at  T  =  175  -  200  °C  and  p 
=  0.1  -  6.9  MPa  are  as  follows:  enthalpy  AHp_»§  =  2.41  kcal/mol  and  entropy  ASp_^>  =  5.59 
cal/mol.  The  p  -  T  phase  diagram  for  the  liquid  and  condensed  phases  of  RDX  (a,  P,  and  y  modi¬ 
fications)  is  given  in  [21].  According  to  [21],  at  p  <  30000  atm  the  a  modification  is  the  main  for 
condensed  phase  of  RDX.  Its  density  at  room  temperature  is  equal  to  1.806  g/cm3.

230°,  they  obtained  the  following  main  components:  N2O  (40  %),  NO  (9.9  %),  N2  (9.6  %),  HCN 
(4.5  %),  CH20  (22.9  %),  C02  (8.5  %),  and  CO  (4.1  %).  The  nitrogen-containing  compounds 
were  primarily  in  the  form  14N 15NO,  15NO,  14N 15N,  and  HC  14N. 

The  composition  of  the  decomposition  products  of  “labeled”  (i.e.  containing  15N  atoms)  HMX 
and  RDX  is  given  in  [23].  The  thermal  decomposition  was  performed  in  a  reactor  with  a  volume 
of  380  cm3  in  argon  at  T  =  230  -  285  °C  and  at  p  =  40  torr.  The  sample  weight  was  50  mg.  The 
content  of  compounds  with  the  given  types  of  nitrogen  atom  in  the  decomposition  products  [23] 
is  given  in  Table  2.4.  From  the  experimental  data  of  Suryanarayana  et  al.  [22,  23]  the  following 
conclusions  can  be  drawn:  the  break  of  the  C — N  bond  dominates  over  the  break  of  the  N — N 
bond,  NO  is  formed  from  the  nitrogen  of  the  nitrogroup  (NO2),  almost  all  N2O  and  N2  species  are 
formed  without  break  of  the  nitramine  N— N  bond,  and  HCN  is  formed  from  the  “ring”  nitrogen.

The  decomposition  mechanism  of  HMX  proposed  in  [22]  includes  the  break  of  four  C — N  bonds 
with  the  formation  of  four  CH2NNO2  molecules,  which  then  decompose  into  CH2O  and  N2O. 
Goshgarian  [24]  studied  the  decomposition  of  HMX  and  RDX  at  temperatures  lower  and  higher 
than  the  melting  point  in  vacuum  and  in  a  flow  reactor  in  a  hot  helium  stream  at  p  =  1  atm.  In  the 
thermal  decomposition  of  HMX  in  a  flow  reactor  at  T  =  240  -  290  °C,  a  mass  spectrometer  re¬ 
corded  intense  peaks  with  m/e  =  30  (CH20,  NO),  44  (NzO,  C02,  CH2NO),  28  (N2,  CO,  H2CN), 
27  (HCN),  18  (H2O),  and  46  (NO2),  while  peaks  with  m/e  =  70  (C2H2NNO,  C2H2N2O)  and  75 


2—13 


(CH2NHN02,  CH3NN02,  CH2NN02H)  were  recorded  only  at  T  =  270  -  290  °C.  Fragments  with 
large  molecular  masses  were  also  observed:  M  =  120  (CH2N3O4),  128  (C3H4N4Ti2),  and  148 
(C2H4N2N204).  The  appearance  of  these  fragments  was  associated  with  the  possible  formation  of 
HN02.  The  peaks  with  m/e  =  175,  128,  and  81  indicate  the  possibility  of  elimination  of  HONO 
from  RDX  and  from  the  HMX  fragment  with  M  =  222.  The  formation  of  the  fragment  with  M  = 
128  from  the  fragment  with  M  =  222  is  postulated  in  [24]. 

Goshgarian  [24]  proposed  several  schemes  of  nitramine  decomposition.  The  HMX  decomposi¬ 
tion  at  low  temperatures  leads  to  the  elimination  of  CH2NH2  and  N02  (which  gives  M  =  176).  At 
high  temperatures,  the  elimination  of  CH2NN02  dominates,  and  the  spectrum  is  similar  to  that  of 
the  RDX.  For  RDX,  it  is  postulated  that  the  elimination  of  N02  proceeds  at  low  temperatures  and 
the  scission  of  the  ring  with  elimination  of  CH2NN02  (this  gives  M  =  148)  proceeds  at  high  tem¬ 
peratures.  Schroeder  [25]  examined  the  scheme  of  decomposition  of  RDX  that  included  scission 
of  the  bond  N-N02  with  formation  of  N02  and  fragment  of  RDX  followed  by  decomposition  of 
fragment  with  formation  of  CH2N*  and  H2C=N-N02 

Farber  and  Srivastava  [26,  27]  studied  the  thermal  decomposition  and  sublimation  of  nitramines 
at  p  =  10'5  -  10'3  atm.  In  the  thermal  decomposition  of  RDX  at  220  °C,  peaks  with  m/e  =  28,  30, 
40,  44,  46,  56,  74,  82,  83,  102,  120,  128,  132,  and  148  were  observed.  The  peaks  with  m/e  =  74 
and  148  were  assigned  to  the  initial  fragmentation  of  RDX  with  the  formation  of  CH2NN02.  The 
peaks  with  m/e  =  128,  82,  and  83  were  attributed  to  a  competing  process  involving  elimination  of 
N02  and  H  from  the  RDX  molecule  (HONO  formation).  The  peaks  with  m/e  =  102  and  56  are 
associated  with  the  subsequent  elimination  of  N02  from  the  fragment  with  M  =  148,  whereas  the 
migration  of  N02  in  this  fragment  causes  elimination  of  CH2N  and  explains  the  formation  of  the 
peak  with  m/e  =  120.  One  of  the  major  products  of  HMX  decomposition  at  175  -  275  °C  was  a 
C2H4N404  molecule  (M  =  148).  Components  were  also  recorded  at  m/e  =  222,  128,  120,  102,  74, 
56,46,  32,  30, 28,  and  18. 

The  peaks  with  m/e  =120  (CH2N304)  and  128  can  also  be  attributed  to  reactions  of  gaseous 
products  with  the  condensed  phase.  Farber  and  Srivastava  [27]  also  detected  peaks  with  m/e=  249 
and  250  and  concluded  that  nitrous  acid  NHO  or  N02  should  also  form. 

The  peak  with  m/e  =120  was  postulated  previously  [28]  to  be  the  result  of  migration  of  the  N02 
group  in  the  molecule  with  saturated  bonds  (fragment  of  division  of  HMX  by  two  equal  parts 
with  m/e  148).  Morgan  and  Bayer  [29],  using  electron  spin  resonance  (ESR),  detected  large 
amounts  of  H2CN*  and  N02  radicals  in  the  HMX  pyrolysis  products  at  260  °C.  As  the  tempera¬ 
ture  increased  to  the  melting  point,  the  H2CN*  concentration  decreased  abruptly. 

The  effect  of  experimental  conditions  on  the  results  of  kinetic  studies  has  been  widely  discussed 
in  the  literature  on  thermal  decomposition.  The  differences  in  mass  and  geometrical  dimensions 
of  samples  and  reactions  on  the  walls  and  in  the  volume  of  a  vessel  lead  to  the  so-called  “com¬ 
pensation  effect,”  i.e.,  for  a  given  substance,  the  activation  energies  and  pre-exponents  deter¬ 
mined  by  different  investigators  are  in  direct  relation:  the  higher  the  activation  energy,  the  higher 
the  preexponent.  An  example  of  the  kinetic  compensation  effect  for  the  homolytic  decomposition 
of  dimethylnitramine  is  given  in  [30],  No  theoretical  ground  for  this  effect  is  available.  Note  only 
that  in  experimental  studies  within  a  comparatively  narrow  temperature  range,  one  can  determine 


2—14 


reliably  only  the  average  reaction-rate  constant.  Extrapolation  of  the  kinetic  data  beyond  the  nar¬ 
row  temperature  range  leads  to  significant  errors  in  the  calculation  of  the  chemical  reaction  rate. 

Oxley  et  al.  [31]  undertook  an  attempt  to  eliminate  side  effects  in  nitramine  decomposition. 
Isothermal  decomposition  was  studied  at  189  -  289  °C  (HMX)  and  200  -  240  °C  (RDX)  in  an 
acetone  solution  at  a  concentration  of  the  substances  not  higher  than  1  %.  These  conditions  pre¬ 
vented  intermediate  radical  reactions  and  auto  catalysis.  For  comparison,  experiments  were  per¬ 
formed  on  the  decomposition  of  0.2  g  samples  of  the  powdered  pure  substances  at  200  -  250  °C 
(RDX)  and  230  -  270  °C  (HMX).  Interestingly,  in  nitramine  decomposition  in  low-concentration 
solutions,  the  number  of  moles  of  the  gaseous  products  formed  was  3—4.5  times  smaller  than  in 
the  decomposition  of  the  powdered  substances.  Special  experiments  showed  that  the  primary  de¬ 
composition  of  the  RDX  condensed  phase  is  described  by  a  first-order  equation,  and  the  decom¬ 
position  rates  for  the  powder  and  solution  are  approximately  the  same  at  fixed  temperature.  The 
significant  difference  in  composition  and  amount  between  the  decomposition  products  is  due  to 
the  different  reaction  pathways.  In  particular,  in  the  decomposition  in  solution,  the  observed 
amount  of  the  mononitroso  derivative  of  RDX  is  3-4  times  larger  than  that  in  the  decomposi¬ 
tion  of  the  powdered  substance.  Analysis  of  the  kinetic  data  and  the  composition  of  the  decompo¬ 
sition  product  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  initial  step  of  the  decomposition  of  RDX  and  HMX 
involves  homolytic  break  of  the  N-NO2  bond.  In  addition,  the  important  role  of  the  intramolecu¬ 
lar  transition  of  hydrogen  is  noted.  The  joint  progress  of  these  reaction  steps  leads  to  dissociation 
of  the  ring  structure  of  the  nitramines. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  Oxley  et  al.  [31]  did  not  detect  NO  and  NO2  traces  in  the  products  of 
complete  decomposition  of  RDX  and  HMX,  whereas  these  traces  were  recorded  in  [32—34]. 
Rauch  and  Fanelli  [32]  proposed  an  original  treatment  of  the  decomposition  mechanism  of  RDX. 
They  detected  small  amounts  of  nitrogen  dioxide  NO2  in  the  decomposition  of  molten  RDX  at 
212  °C.  The  NO2  yield  did  not  depend  on  the  sample  weight  and  increased  in  proportion  to  the 
reactor  volume.  The  yield  of  the  remaining  products  did  not  depend  on  the  sample  weight  and  the 
reaction  volume.  This  indicates  that  NO2  is  formed  in  the  gas-phase  decomposition,  and  the  re¬ 
maining  products  are  formed  primarily  in  the  liquid  phase.  The  authors  conclude  that  the  scission 
of  the  N — N02  bond  proceeds  exclusively  in  the  gas  phase. 

It  is  of  interest  to  compare  the  data  of  different  authors  for  the  composition  of  the  gaseous  prod¬ 
ucts  of  nitramine  decomposition  in  the  liquid  phase.  This  comparison  is  given  in  Table  2.5.  It 
follows  from  Table  2.5  that  the  amount  of  gaseous  products  increases  with  increase  in  the  degree 
of  decomposition  of  the  starting  substance  in  going  over  from  RDX  to  HMX.  The  difference  in 
the  qualitative  composition  of  the  products  can  be  attributed  to  the  temperature  effect,  and  also  to 
the  difference  in  sample  weight  (recall  that  minimum  weighted  samples  were  used  in  [31])  and  in 
geometrical  dimensions  of  the  vessels. 

Table  2.6  gives  the  composition  of  the  products  from  the  thermal  decomposition  of  RDX  at  195 
°C  determined  experimentally  in  [35].  In  these  cases,  NO3,  NO2,  and  H2O  are  also  presented. 

In  studies  of  the  reaction  rate,  it  was  found  that  a  change  in  sample  volume  by  a  factor  of  10  does 
not  change  the  decomposition  rate  for  a  constant  reactor  volume.  However,  the  decomposition 


2—15 


rate  is  directly  proportional  to  the  reactor  volume.  It  is  concluded  that  the  gas-phase  decomposi¬ 
tion  of  RDX  is  of  significance  in  the  initial  stage.

Cosgrove  and  Owen  [36]  studied  the  effect  of  the  composition  of  the  gas  medium  on  the  decom¬ 
position  rate  of  RDX.  N2,  N2O,  CO,  and  H2O  turned  out  to  inhibit  the  decomposition  of  RDX.  An 
NO  additive  decelerates  the  decomposition  as  compared  with  other  gases,  and  CH2O  accelerates 
the  decomposition. 

Robertson  [37]  measured  the  decomposition  products  of  liquid  RDX  at  225  and  267  0  in  nitrogen 
(a  pressure  of  60  torr  was  used  to  inhibit  the  evaporation  process).  N2,  N2O,  NO,  CO2,  CO,  and 
H2  in  descending  order,  and  also  significant  unmeasured  amounts  of  CH2O  and  H2O  were  de¬ 
tected.  The  same  products  were  found  for  HMX  at  280  °C.  NO2  formation  was  not  observed.  The 
large  amounts  of  CH2O  and  N2O  are  evidence  in  favor  of  the  mechanism  including  transfer  of  an 
O  atom  to  the  neighboring  CH2  group  with  the  subsequent  elimination  of  CH2O. 

High-temperature  pyrolysis  of  nitramines 

Rocchio  and  Juhasz  [38]  detected  N2  (17.4),  N2O  (17.1),  NO  (23.1),  CO  (3.6),  CO2  (4.2),  HCN 
(19.2),  and  H2O  (15.4)  in  the  products  of  HMX  pyrolysis  on  a  heated  block  at  T  =  271  -  800  °C. 
The  relative  percent  composition  of  the  gas  mixture  at  a  block  temperature  of  350  °C  is  indicated 
in  the  parentheses. 


Axworthy  et  al.  [33]  studied  the  high-temperature  pyrolysis  of  HMX  and  RDX  in  a  hot  helium 
stream  at  a  temperature  of  300  to  1000  °C.  The  yield  of  CH2O,  N2O,  NO,  N2,  HCN,  CO,  and  CO2 
with  variation  of  temperature  was  analyzed.  At  T  =  300  °C,  N2O  and  CH2O  were  the  main  py¬ 
rolysis  products.  The  N2O  and  CH2O  contributions  decreased,  and  the  NO  and  HCN  contribu¬ 
tions  increased  with  a  rise  in  temperature.  At  T  =  600  °C,  the  N2O,  NO,  and  HCN  contributions 
were  approximately  equal  (=  20  -  30  %),  and  the  CH2O  contribution  was  about  5  %.  At  T  =  800 
°C,  the  HCN  contribution  was  =  25  %.  Axworthy  et  al.  [33]  explained  the  small  CH2O  yield  at 
high  temperatures  by  the  following  factors: 

—  smaller  amount  of  CH2O  formed  in  the  primary  products  of  pyrolysis, 

—  proceeding  the  secondary  reactions  involving  CH2O,  and 

—  thermal  decomposition  of  CH2O. 

Flanigan  and  Stokes  [39]  studied  the  decomposition  products  of  HMX  and  RDX  using  rapid 
heating  of  a  copper  (platinum)  wire.  Both  NO2  and  N2O  were  detected.  Since  the  HMX  and 
RDX  spectra  turned  out  to  be  similar,  a  unified  five-stage  mechanism  similar  to  that  suggested 
by  Schroeder  [25]  was  proposed  for  nitramine  decomposition, : 

(1)  Formation  of  a  free  NO2  radical; 

(2)  Rapid  fragmentation  of  the  ring; 

(3)  Formation  of  methylene  nitramine  CH2=N — NO2  and  CH2N*  radical; 

(4)  Conversion  of  unstable  CH2NNO2  species  to  CH2O  and  N2O; 

(5)  Reactions  of  NO2  and  N2O  with  CH2O  to  form  CO,  CO2,  N2,  H2O,  and  NO.  Reactions  of 
CH2N*  with  the  other  products  produce  HCN. 

Fifer  [3]  proposed  the  generalized  scheme  of  nitramine  decomposition  taking  into  account  the 
data  of  various  investigators.  According  to  Fifer  [3],  the  fragment  with  M  =  222  formed  from 
HMX  does  not  necessarily  correspond  to  RDX  and  the  components  with  M  =  148  and  102  cannot 
be  pictured  cyclically.  The  proposed  scheme  does  not  include  bimolecular  reactions  between 
large  fragments,  and  also  between  the  products  NO2,  HCN,  CH2O,  etc. 

One  should  take  into  account  that  N02  has  relatively  high  reactivity.  There  is  no  clear  under¬ 
standing  of  HONO  formation,  since  nitrous  acid  is  rapidly  expended  by  the  route  2  HONO  = 
NO  +  NO2  +  H2O  to  form  NO2.  Therefore,  the  presence  or  absence  of  NO2  cannot  confirm  scis¬ 
sion  of  the  N — NO2  bond. 

The  presence  of  NO2  is  only  indicative  of  the  possibility  of  scission  of  the  N — NO2  bond  or 
HONO  elimination.  Evidently,  the  C — N  bond  energy  is  greater  than  the  N — NO2  bond  energy. 
Thus,  according  to  the  estimate  of  Shaw  and  Walker  [40],  the  N — NO2  bond  energy  is  E(N-N) 
=66  kcal/mol  for  RDX,  and  it  is  E(N-N)  =46.2  kcal/mol  for  HMX.  The  C — N  bond  energy  is 
estimated  as  85  kcal/mol  for  RDX  and  as  60  kcal/mol  for  HMX.  Hence,  it  is  assumed  that  in  the 
thermal  decomposition  of  nitramines,  either  NO2  (or  HONO)  is  first  split  out  with  immediate 
elimination  of  CH2N  from  the  nitramine  molecule  or  HCN  is  first  split  out  with  the  subsequent 
loss  of  one  or  more  CH2NNO2  molecules. 

The  studies  performed  in  1990’s  [41-47]  made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  understanding  of 
the  thermal-decomposition  mechanism  of  nitramines  at  low  heating  rates  and  under  isothermal 


2—17 


conditions  at  temperatures  lower  or  somewhat  higher  than  the  melting  point.  Technically,  these 
studies  were  very  complex,  and  this  was  a  peculiar  cost  for  the  uniqueness  of  the  experimental 
data  obtained.  Thus,  for  example,  these  studies  widely  used  simultaneous  high-sensitive  thermo- 
gravimetric  gas-beam  modulated  mass  spectroscopy,  methods  of  isotope  mixing,  and  measure¬ 
ments  of  the  deuterium  kinetic  isotope  effect. 

Experiments  with  both  the  original  nitramines  and  their  complete  analogs  containing  labeled  2H, 
13C,  15N,  and  180  atoms  were  performed  to  study  the  decomposition  kinetics,  to  elucidate  the  re¬ 
action  pathways,  and  to  identify  the  reaction  products.  The  results  obtained  are  summarized  by 
Bulusu  and  Behrens  [47].  It  was  found  that  the  primary  steps  of  decomposition  (scission  of  the 
N — NO2  bond  and  formation  of  HONO)  and  secondary  reactions  between  the  starting  nitramines 
and  its  decomposition  products  result  in  the  formation  of  H2O,  N2O,  CH2O,  NO,  CO,  HCN,  NO2, 
NH2CHO,  and  CH3NHCHO  molecules,  which  are  common  for  the  decompositions  of  RDX  and 
HMX.  At  the  same  time,  C3H3H3O  (M  =  97)  and  C3H6H6O5  (M  =  206,  ONDNTA)  are  formed 
only  in  the  decomposition  of  RDX,  and  (CH3)  2N — NO  (M  =  74)  and  C4N8H8O7  (M  =  280, 
ONTNTA)  are  formed  only  in  the  decomposition  of  HMX.  Experiments  on  isotope  mixing  of 
the  starting  compounds  and  nitramines  with  the  nitrogen  atoms  entirely  replaced  by  15N  atoms 
showed  that  the  mononitroso  compounds  ONDNTA  and  ONTNTA  are  produced  via  the  forma¬ 
tion  of  the  N — NO  bond  in  place  of  the  scission  N — NO2  bond.  Both  ONDNTA  and  ONTNTA 
then  decompose  into  low-molecular  products,  thus  ensuring  the  low  average  molecular  mass  of 
the  thermal  decomposition  products  of  nitramines. 


The  most  detailed  results  are  reported  for  the  thermal  decomposition  of  RDX.  In  particular,  Bu- 
lusi  and  Behrens  [47]  proposed  the  following  generalized  scheme  [47]  of  the  reaction  pathways 
for  RDX  at  200  -  215  °C  (in  the  liquid  phase): 

— .  unim  ole  cu  lar,  HON O  lib  eration ;  C3N2H3+H2O  +N O+N 02  30  % 

_ ^  unimolecular,  b ond  N  -  N  scission ;  N02+H2CN+2N20+2CH20  1 0  %

^  autocatalysis- amide  residue ;  N20+ CH20+N02+NH2CH0  25% 

Here  the  numbers  in  percent  correspond  to  the  fraction  of  the  starting  RDX  that  decomposes  by 
the  given  reaction  pathway.  The  authors  note  that  the  latter  autocatalytic  pathway  can  be  realized 
via  the  decomposition  of  both  the  starting  substance  and  its  mononitrose  analog,  the  intermediate 
product  ONDNTA. 


Because  of  the  lack  of  quantitative  experimental  data,  it  is  impossible  to  formulate  a  similar 
scheme  for  the  decomposition  of  molten  HMX.  One  can  only  speak  on  the  qualitative  similarity 
of  the  initial  steps  of  the  decompositions,  but  the  higher  melting  point  and,  accordingly,  the 
higher  degree  of  the  condensed-phase  decomposition  can  introduce  significant  corrections  into 
the  real  picture  of  the  process. 


Note  that  the  above  experimental  data  correspond  primarily  to  the  results  of  studies  of  low- 
temperature  decomposition  of  nitramines  or  decomposition  under  slow-heating  conditions.  Obvi¬ 
ously,  it  is  difficult  to  extrapolate  these  data  to  the  conditions  of  combustion  or  explosion  waves 


2—18 


because  of  the  great  difference  in  heating  rates  and  temperatures  in  the  reaction  zones.  In  par¬ 
ticular,  Fifer  [3]  noted  that  it  is  important  to  find  direct  evidence  for  what  the  first  step  of  the 
thermal  decomposition  is:  the  scission  of  the  N — N  bond  (elimination  of  NO2  or  HONO)  or  the 
scission  of  the  C — N  bond  (elimination  of  CHNNO2).  It  is  not  clear  whether  the  first  step  is  the 
gas-,  liquid-,  or  condensed-phase  decomposition. 

Over  the  last  decade,  great  success  has  been  achieved  in  developing  dynamic  high-sensitive 
methods  of  recording  gaseous  products  of  the  thermal  decomposition  of  nitramines  under  iso¬ 
thermic  and  nonisothemic  conditions  [48].  The  goal  was  to  bring  the  conditions  of  experiments 
on  thermal  decomposition  as  close  as  possible  to  the  conditions  of  residence  of  substances  in  a 
combustion  wave  at  elevated  pressures. 

Oyumi  and  Brill  [49]  studied  the  thermal  decomposition  of  RDX  and  HMX  samples  with  a  mass 
of  1  mg  at  various  heating  rates  (8  -  200  K/sec)  of  a  Nichrome  wire  and  at  nitrogen  pressures  of 
0.003  -  68  atm  using  a  high-speed  infrared  spectrometer  with  a  Fourier  transform.  Temporal  rec¬ 
ords  of  NO2,  N20,  CH2O,  HCN,  NO,  CO2,  HONO,  and  CO  concentrations  were  obtained. 
HNCO  in  small  amounts  (by  estimates,  <  5  %)  was  detected.  In  the  decomposition  of  RDX  in 
nitrogen  at  a  =  1  atm  in  the  vicinity  of  the  melting  point  (T  =  75  K),  the  major  decomposition 
products  are  NO2,  N20,  CH20,  and  HCN,  and  NO,  CO,  HONO,  and  CO  form  in  small  amounts. 
With  time,  the  CH2O  and  N2O  concentrations  decrease,  and  the  NO  concentration  increases.  This 
is  attributed  to  the  progress  of  the  reaction  between  CH2O  and  NO2.  The  formation  of  CH2O  and 
NO2  is  explained  by  the  decomposition  of  RDX  into  CH2HHO2  followed  by  the  decomposition 
into  CH2O  and  NO2. 

The  decomposition  of  HMX  in  nitrogen  at  a  =  1  atm  yields  the  same  products,  but  the  initial 
HCN  concentrations  are  higher  than  the  CH2O  concentrations  at  all  heating  rates  (in  the  decom¬ 
position  of  RDX,  this  is  observed  only  at  high  heating  rates).  The  composition  of  the  products 
formed  in  the  decomposition  of  nitramines  at  various  nitrogen  pressures  is  given  in  Table  2.7.  In 
this  case,  the  Nichrome  wire  was  initially  heated  at  a  rate  of  140  K/sec,  and  the  wire  temperature 
was  then  maintained  at  this  level.  The  components  H2O,  H2,  and  O2,  which  are  not  detected  by 
this  method,  and  also  HNCO,  CO,  and  nitramine  aerosols  are  not  included  in  Table  2.7.

According  to  experimental  data  of  Oyumi  and  Brill  [49],  NO2  is  one  of  the  major  initial  products 
of  the  decomposition  of  RDX,  and  the  decomposition  of  HMX  yields  primarily  HCN  and  N2O. 
The  NO2  concentration  decreases  rapidly  in  secondary  reactions,  and  the  NO  concentration  is 
initially  small  and  increases  rapidly  in  secondary  reactions.  Nitrous  acid  HONO  is  found  in  the 
initial  stage  of  the  process.  With  decrease  in  pressure,  the  NO2  fraction  in  the  products  of  RDX 
decomposition  increases.  Thus,  at  a  nitrogen  pressure  of  50  torr  and  a  heating  rate  of  1 10  K/sec, 


2—19 


the  N02  fraction  =  50  %,  HCN  =  20  %,  CH20  s  10  %,  and  N20  =  10  %.  Oyumi  and  Brill  [49] 
draw  the  following  conclusions: 

1.  The  formation  of  N02  dominates  in  the  rapid  RDX  pyrolysis  (the  heating  rate  is  8 — 200  K  sec' 
’)  at  atmospheric  pressure.  This  indicates  the  predominant  break  of  the  N — N02  bond  in  the  ini¬ 
tial  stage  of  decomposition  of  RDX. 

2.  The  initial  NO  concentration  is  close  to  zero. 

3.  CH20  and  N20  are  important  initial  products  of  RDX  pyrolysis  near  the  melting  point,  possi¬ 
bly  because  the  break  of  the  C — N  bond  occurs  in  the  condensed  phase.  When  the  temperature  of 
the  wire  considerably  exceeds  the  RDX  melting  point,  the  HCN  and  N02  concentrations  become 
significant,  and  this  points  to  the  gas-phase  decomposition  of  RDX. 

4.  At  all  temperatures,  RDX  pyrolysis  is  accompanied  by  the  formation  of  nitrous  acid  HONO, 
but  nitrous  acid  is  unstable,  and,  hence,  sensitive  recording  methods  are  required. 

5.  At  low  pressures  and  high  heating  rates,  RDX  sublimation  makes  a  great  contribution.  High 
pressures  and  heating  rates  decrease  the  N02  yield,  prevent  the  formation  of  HCN  and  HONO, 
and  increase  the  yield  of  NO,  C02,  and  CH20. 

6.  CH20  and  N20,  along  with  HCN  and  N02,  are  the  major  products  of  HMX  decomposition  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  melting  point.  With  increase  in  temperature  and  heating  rate,  HCN  and  N02 
dominate,  and  CH20  and  N20  play  a  less  significant  role. 

7.  HONO  is  the  product  of  HMX  pyrolysis  at  subatmospheric  pressures  and  heating  rates  of  40  - 
145  K  sec'1. 

8.  With  increase  in  pressure  from  0.003  to  68  atm,  the  role  of  reactions  in  the  HMX  condensed 
phase  increases  relative  to  gas-phase  reactions. 

Palopoli  and  Brill  [50]  reported  data  on  the  thermal  decomposition  of  HMX  on  a  Nichrome  rib¬ 
bon  at  atmospheric  pressure  in  different  gases  and  under  heating  rates  of  40,  90,  140,  and  180 
K/sec.  The  final  temperature  of  the  ribbon  was  600,  780,  and  1000  K.  At  all  heating  rates  at  the 
initial  moment  the  H2CO  yield  is  about  two  times  higher  than  the  yield  of  HCN  =  NO  =  N02  = 
N20,  and  it  is  a  factor  of  6—8  higher  than  the  HONO  yield.  In  [50],  the  formation  of  CHO  and 
N20  is  explained  as  follows: 

—  transfer  of  an  O  atom  from  the  NH02  group  to  the  CH2  group  followed  by  scission  of  the 
C — N  bond  [40], 

—  dissociation  of  H2CNN02  via  a  similar  process, 

—  bimolecular  decomposition  of  H2CNN02  catalyzed  by  the  OH  radical  [51]: 

H2CNN02  +  OH  =  H2CO  +  N20  +  OH. 

The  effect  of  the  composition  of  the  gas  mixture  on  the  thermal  decomposition  of  HMX  was 
studied  [50]  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  a  heating  rate  of  140  K/sec  in  gas  mixtures  of  the  fol¬ 
lowing  partial  compositions:  (380  torr  H2)/(380  torr  Ar,  CO,  02,  NO);  (25  torr  N02)/(735  torr 
Ar);  (380  torr  NH3)/(380  torr  Ar).  The  final  temperature  was  900  K.  The  initial  formation  of  the 
products  (t  =  2  sec)  occurred  at  T  =  550  K,  which  is  close  to  the  melting  point.  The  addition  of 
N02  and  NH3  exerted  the  most  significant  effect  on  the  decomposition.  The  addition  of  N02 
leads  to  a  sudden  decrease  in  the  H2CO  yield  and  increase  in  the  NO  yield.  The  HCN  concentra¬ 
tion  increases  only  slightly,  and  this  is  attributed  to  the  reaction  H2CN  +  N02  — >  HCN  +  HONO, 


2—20 


which  increases  the  HONO  yield.  The  decomposition  of  HONO  is  an  effective  source  of  OH 
radicals,  which  are  responsible  for  fast  dissociation  of  H2CO. 

With  the  addition  of  HN3,  isocyanic  acid  HNCO,  which  is  observed  in  all  the  other  experiments, 
is  absent.  H2CO  is  present  in  small  amounts  and  is  rapidly  expended,  and  HONO  is  absent.  Cy¬ 
anic  acid  HCN  and  nitrogen  dioxide  NO2  are  rapidly  consumed  and  the  N2O  concentration  rap¬ 
idly  increases.  Palopoli  and  Brill  [50]  explain  this  by  the  common  mechanism  of  NH3  oxidation. 
In  particular,  the  decomposition  of  N02  and  the  formation  of  N20  are  associated  with  the  reaction 
NH2  +  NO2  — >  N2O  +  H2O,  and  the  rapid  decomposition  of  HCN  is  associated  with  significant 
production  of  OH  radicals.  It  is  concluded  that  NHX  and  NO2  can  exert  a  significant  effect  on  the 
burning  rate  of  nitramine-based  propellants. 

The  purely  gas-phase  decomposition  of  RDX  was  studied  in  [52],  where  a  molecular  beam  of 
RDX  vapors  was  irradiated  by  C02-laser  pulses.  The  pulse  duration  was  600  nsec,  and  the  repeti¬ 
tion  frequency  was  30  or  100  Hz.  RDX  vapors  were  produced  by  sublimation  of  the  substance  in 
a  vacuum  furnace  at  130  °C  (vapor  pressure  0.1  torr);  He  at  a  pressure  of  50  torr  was  used  as  a 
carrier  gas.  A  beam  of  RDX  molecules  moving  at  an  average  speed  of  10  m/sec  was  irradiated  by 
a  C02-laser  pulse,  which  led  to  multiphoton  dissociation  and  the  subsequent  decomposition  of 
RDX  molecules.  The  products  were  then  analyzed  by  means  of  a  time-of-flight  mass- 
spectrometer.  A  detailed  consideration  of  the  time  history  of  the  amplitudes  of  signals  at  chosen 
values  of  m/e  and  analysis  of  the  composition  of  the  decomposition  products  led  Zhao  et  al.  [52] 
to  the  conclusion  that  the  primary  step  of  gas-phase  decomposition  of  RDX  proceeds  predomi¬ 
nantly  by  instantaneous  division  of  the  ring  into  three  identical  fragments  with  mass  74 
(CH2NNO2).  The  subsequent  secondary  dissociation  of  CH2NNO2  yields  HCN,  H2CO,  HONO, 
and  N2O.  Energy  estimates  show  that  under  irradiation  by  a  C02-laser  pulse,  RDX  molecules  ac¬ 
quire  a  fairly  large  store  of  internal  energy,  and  this  leads  to  scission  of  the  C — N  bond,  although 
the  scission  of  the  N — N  bond  is  more  thermodynamically  favorable. 

An  attempt  to  study  the  primary  step  of  condensed-phase  decomposition  of  RDX  was  undertaken 
by  Botcher  and  Wight  [53].  In  this  study,  a  thin  RDX  film  produced  by  vacuum  deposition  on  a 
massive  substrate,  which  was  transparent  to  infrared  radiation,  was  irradiated  by  a  short  (35  p 
sec)  pulse  of  a  CO2  laser  under  vacuum  and  cooling  to  77  K.  According  to  simple  estimates  of 
thermal  balance  ignoring  evaporation,  a  film  10-15  pm  thick  should  be  heated  instantaneously 
to  1000  -  1200  K.  After  that,  rapid  cooling  to  about  400  K  due  to  heat  transfer  to  the  substrate 
should  occur  for  0.003  sec.  The  authors  note  that  this  estimate  is  rather  rough,  and  they  did  not 
attempt  to  measure  the  rate  constants  of  the  chemical  reactions.  Obviously,  allowance  for  the  fi¬ 
nite  transparency  of  the  film  and  substrate  materials,  as  well  as  allowance  for  the  evaporation  of 
the  film  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the  film  temperature.  Note  that  the  features  of  evaporation  of  mate¬ 
rials  at  a  heating  rate  higher  than  107  K/sec  are  completely  unknown,  and  this  introduces  addi¬ 
tional  difficulties  into  the  treatment  of  the  temperature  conditions  in  the  object  studied.  But  this 
does  not  affect  the  reliability  of  the  qualitative  data  of  this  paper  related  to  the  finding  and  identi¬ 
fication  of  the  primary  products  of  condensed-phase  decomposition  of  RDX. 

In  the  experiment  with  pulsed  irradiation,  about  a  third  of  the  mass  of  the  film  has  been  evapo¬ 
rated  during  the  heating — cooling  period,  and  the  remaining  part  of  the  condensed  phase  was 
analyzed  using  infrared  spectroscopy  to  study  the  composition  of  the  decomposition  products. 


2—21 


Under  the  action  of  a  pulse  with  a  minimum  power,  that  ensured  the  appearance  of  initial  de¬ 
composition  products,  only  dimers  of  nitrogen  dioxide  (N2O4)  were  recorded  in  the  condensed 
phase.  This  can  be  treated  as  the  result  of  scission  of  the  N — N  bond  and  NO2  formation  in  the 
primary  step  of  RDX  decomposition.  When  irradiation  was  performed  using  a  more  powerful 
pulse  and  a  cover  glass,  which  prevents  dispersion  of  the  evaporating  substance  and  decomposi¬ 
tion  products,  NO,  HCN,  N2O,  and  CO2  were  additionally  recorded.  The  other  possible  decompo¬ 
sition  products  were  not  identified  because  their  spectra  were  overlapped  by  the  spectrum  of  the 
starting  RDX.  However,  the  number  of  the  NO2  species  formed  in  the  decomposition  of  one 
RDX  molecule  remained  to  be  established,  although  the  number  of  RDX  molecules  that  had  de¬ 
composed  indicated  indirectly  the  formation  of  one  NO2  species  in  the  primary  step.  In  the  subse¬ 
quent  investigation  of  the  same  authors  [54],  which  was  performed  using  RDX  in  which  14N  ni¬ 
trogen  atoms  were  completely  replaced  by  15N  atoms,  Botcher  and  Wight  obtained  direct  evi¬ 
dence  for  the  formation  of  one  NO2  radical  in  the  primary  step  of  condensed-phase  decomposi¬ 
tion  of  RDX.  It  was  expected  that  if  both  the  NO2  molecules  forming  a  dimer  are  produced  by  the 
decomposition  of  the  same  RDX  molecule,  only  dimers  such  as  14, 14N2  O4  and  15, 15N2  O4  have  to 
be  observed.  Otherwise,  formation  of  dimers  such  as 14’  15N2  O4  was  also  expected.  Under  pulsed 
irradiation  of  a  film  consisting  of  a  mixture  of  the  starting  and  “labeled”  RDX,  N2O4  molecules 
were  detected  with  a  statistically  uniform  distribution  of  14N  and  15N,  and  this  unambiguously 
indicates  the  formation  of  one  NO2  species  in  the  high-temperature  condensed-phase  decomposi¬ 
tion  of  RDX.

It  follows  from  the  tables  that  the  rate  of  the  low-temperature  gas-phase  decomposition  (at  200 
°C)  of  RDX  is  a  factor  of  several  hundreds  higher  than  that  of  the  solid-state  decomposition,  and 
it  is  a  factor  of  several  tens  higher  than  the  decomposition  in  the  liquid  state;  the  rate  of  the 
solid-state  decomposition  of  HMX  is  lower  than  the  rate  of  decomposition  of  RDX.

The  rate  constants  of  nitramine  decomposition  versus  temperature  are  given  in  Figs.  2.1  and  2.2. 
As  follows  from  the  figures,  the  literature  data  on  the  decomposition  of  RDX  agree  satisfactorily 
for  both  the  gas  and  liquid  phase;  the  data  for  HMX  decomposition  are  characterized  by  a  sig¬ 
nificant  scattering. 

The  above  materials  cannot  claim  to  be  a  thorough  review  of  the  data  available  on  the  thermal 
decomposition  of  RDX  and  HMX,  because  these  data  are  very  extensive  and  are  not  easily  acces¬ 
sible.  Nevertheless,  they  provide  a  clear  understanding  of  the  complex  decomposition  mechanism 
of  cyclic  nitramines  and  its  dependence  on  various  factors.

Summary  of  decomposition  studies. 

The  nitramines  studied,  as  well  as  the  majority  of  energetic  materials,  are  capable  of  both  con¬ 
densed-phase  and  gas-phase  chemical  transformations.  In  this  case,  depending  on  the  heating 
rate,  sample  dimensions,  and  also  on  the  composition  of  the  ambient  medium,  both  primary  and 
secondary  chemical  reactions  can  occur,  and  this  is  responsible  for  the  great  variety  of  decompo¬ 
sition  products  and  rates  of  the  global  reactions. 

Apparently,  the  primary  step  of  gas-phase  decomposition  of  nitramine  vapors  can  be  studied  in 
the  most  pure  form  if  the  interaction  between  the  decomposition  products  is  effectively  inhib¬ 
ited.  An  example  of  such  a  study  is  given  in  [52],  where  the  decomposition  of  a  molecular  beam 
of  RDX  vapors  under  the  action  of  a  short  laser  pulse  was  studied. 

The  primary  step  of  condensed-phase  decomposition  is  difficult  to  study  separately.  An  interest¬ 
ing  experimental  approach  was  formulated  in  [54],  where  a  thin  RDX  film  was  irradiated  by  a 
laser  pulse  under  deep  vacuum  and  deep  preliminary  cooling  of  the  substrate.  The  further  im¬ 
provement  of  this  approach  is  associated  with  the  use  of  recording  methods  with  a  high  time 
resolution  to  realize  the  possibility  of  observing  the  formation  kinetics  of  primary  and  secondary 
decomposition  products  under  programmed  heating  (at  a  varied  rate)  of  thin  films. 

It  also  seems  promising  to  study  nitramine  decomposition  in  low-concentration  solutions,  in 
which  secondary  chemical  reactions  can  be  effectively  inhibited  [31].  In  this  case  too,  dynamic 
methods  of  recording  the  new  compounds  formed  in  the  thermal  decomposition  are  required. 
This  will  make  it  possible  to  observe  the  evolution  of  the  chemical  composition  of  reaction 
products.  Note,  in  particular,  that  Oxley  et  al.  did  not  detect  nitrogen  oxides  NO  and  N2O  (see 
Table  5),  although  NO2  formation  in  the  early  stage  of  decomposition  was  postulated  to  be  the 
primary  step.  It  is  expected  that  the  high-speed  techniques  of  recording  infrared  spectra  will  clar¬ 
ify  this  feature  of  the  process. 


2—24 


At  present,  the  speed  of  response  of  commercial  devices  for  recording  infrared  spectra  is  tens 
and  hundreds  scans  per  second.  Such  devices  make  it  possible  [30]  to  study  in  detail  the  temporal 
evolution  of  the  gaseous  chemical  compounds  formed  in  the  thermal  decomposition  of  nitra- 
mines  under  heating  rates  of  tens  and  hundreds  of  degrees  per  second  or  at  moderately  high  tem¬ 
peratures  (several  tens  of  degrees  below  the  calculated  boiling  point).  Note  once  more  the  funda¬ 
mental  difficulties  in  detecting  the  products  of  the  primary  step  of  the  thermal  decomposition.  If 
these  products  are  formed  in  the  condensed  phase,  they  should  diffuse  to  the  surface  and  desorb 
to  the  gas  phase.  Even  at  small  thickness  of  the  film,  the  time  of  diffusion  in  the  condensed  phase 
is  finite,  and  this  is  responsible  for  the  finite  degree  of  conversion  for  the  secondary  reactions. 
This  interaction  of  the  products  can  continue  in  the  gas  phase  unless  rapid  dilution  of  the  products 
by  inert  gases  is  ensured.  Thus,  if  one  seeks  to  reach  a  considerable  decrease  in  geometrical  di¬ 
mensions  of  specimens  of  the  substances  studied,  it  is  necessary  to  increase  considerably  the  sen¬ 
sitivity  and  speed  of  response  of  the  recording  techniques.  In  reality,  the  available  recording 
techniques  do  not  permit  one  to  determine  reliably  the  composition  of  the  primary  products  of  the 
high-temperature  liquid-phase  decomposition  of  nitramines.  They  provide  only  indirect  evidence 
for  the  existence  of  the  global  mechanism  of  the  reaction  [30]. 

Botcher  and  Wight  [54]  proposed  a  plausible  mechanism  for  the  condensed-phase  thermal  de¬ 
composition  of  RDX.  It  is  based  on  the  ideas  formulated  by  Melius  [51].  The  theoretical  calcula¬ 
tions  of  Melius  [51]  showed  that  the  scission  of  the  N — N  bond  and  the  subsequent  decomposi¬ 
tion  of  the  ring  structure  of  the  nitramine  is  much  more  thermodynamically  favorable  than  the 
scission  of  the  C — N  bond  (and,  of  course,  more  favorable  than  the  simultaneous  scission  of  three 
C — N  bonds,  as  was  shown  in  [52]  for  the  gas-phase  decomposition  of  RDX).  Thus,  according  to 
[54],  the  primary  step  of  the  thermal  decomposition  of  RDX  produces,  as  in  the  Shroeder  scheme 
[25],  an  NO2  radical  and  an  organic  radical,  which  then  decomposes  to  form  HCN,  OH,  and  a 
new  organic  radical.  The  interaction  of  the  latter  with  OH  gives  rise  to  N2O,  H2O,  HCN,  NO,  and 
CH2O.  This  scheme  allows  one,  in  particular,  to  explain  the  nonsimultaneous  appearance  of  NO2 
and  N2O  in  the  experiments  of  [30]  on  high-speed  heating  of  RDX  films. 

To  conclude  this  brief  survey  of  data  on  the  thermal  decomposition  of  nitramines,  it  should  be 
noted  that  there  are  real  causes  for  the  difference  between  the  thermal-decomposition  mecha¬ 
nisms  under  different  experimental  conditions.  At  high  heating  rates,  the  reactions  proceed  at 
high  temperatures  and  by  a  monomolecular  mechanism.  These  kinetic  data  are  related  to  the 
combustion  and  explosion  process.  At  low  heating  rates,  the  reactions  can  proceed  by  a  bimol- 
ecular  mechanism  involving  primary  products  of  decomposition.  The  data  obtained  in  such  ex¬ 
periments  are  related  to  thermal  explosion  and  thermal  decomposition  during  the  storage  and 
processing  of  energetic  materials.  To  propose  and  verify  theoretical  mechanisms  for  the  chemical 
transformations  of  energetic  materials,  it  is  necessary  to  use  experimental  data  obtained  under 
special  model  conditions.  The  theoretical  models  should  then  be  used  with  allowance  for  the  ef¬ 
fects  of  spatial  and  temporal  factors  on  the  progress  of  the  chemical  transformations.  Such  a  task 
will  require  further  improvement  of  experimental  and  theoretical  methods.

2.2.2  Modeling  of  Cyclic-Nitramine  Combustion 

The  combustion  of  cyclic  nitramines  has  been  extensively  studied  in  the  last  three  decades,  when 
nitramines,  as  an  addition  to  the  explosives  “profession”,  have  found  practical  use  as  components 
of  modem  rocket  propellants.  Basic  research  of  nitramines  is  also  important,  since  they  are  the 
simplest  monopropellants  and  there  is  hope  that  a  detailed  physicochemical  mechanism  for  trans¬ 
formations  in  the  combustion  wave  can  be  formulated  and  a  theoretical  correlation  between  the 
chemical  composition  of  the  material  and  its  combustion  characteristics  will  be  established.  It 
should  be  noted  that  this  problem  is  still  far  from  being  solved,  and  a  likely  explanation  of  the 
similarities  and  differences  in  combustion  characteristics  even  for  cyclic  nitramines  that  are 
similar  in  composition  RDX  and  HMX  is  presently  not  available. 

The  combustion  of  most  modem  high-energy  materials  is  characterized  by  melting  of  the  mate¬ 
rial  at  a  temperature  below  the  burning  surface  temperature  and  the  possibility  of  simultaneous 
processes  of  thermal  decomposition  and  vaporization  in  the  surface  layer.  In  early  studies  of 
combustion  of  melted  explosives,  it  was  assumed  that,  since  the  activation  energies  of  thermal- 
decomposition  reactions  could  exceed  several  fold  the  latent  heat  of  vaporization  (for  example, 
according  to  Belyaev  [63],  they  can  differ  by  a  factor  of  2  or  3),  such  materials  bum  without  ap¬ 
preciable  heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase,  and  an  endothermal  vaporization  process  domi¬ 
nates  on  the  surface.  Accordingly,  the  combustion  of  melted  materials  has  been  mostly  inter¬ 
preted  in  terms  of  a  gas-phase  mechanism.  Subsequently,  new  experimental  data  were  obtained 
on  the  kinetics  of  thermal  decomposition  and  vaporization  and  inconsistency  with  classical  con¬ 
cepts  were  revealed.  For  example,  Aleksandrov  et  al.  [64]  demonstrated  experimentally  for  the 
first  time  that  fairly  intense  exothermic  reactions  proceed  in  the  combustion  of  DINA  in  the  con¬ 
densed  phase.  The  gas  products  of  the  thermal  decomposition  are  responsible  for  the  bubble¬ 
like  structure  of  the  surface  layer  of  the  condensed  phase.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that 
obtaining  objective  information  on  the  parameters  of  the  combustion  of  energetic  materials  in¬ 
volves  significant  technical  difficulties  because  of  the  narrow  spatial  regions,  high  temperature, 
and  hostile  environment.  This  limits  the  possibilities  of  studying  the  processes  to  a  considerable 
extent.  For  example,  high  temperature  gradients  hampers  use  of  classical  optical  methods,  and  in 
thermocouple  measurements,  the  presence  of  a  liquid  layer  introduces  uncertainty  in  the  deter¬ 
mined  values  of  surface  temperature  and  heat  flux  from  the  gas  to  the  condensed  phase  because 
of  possible  adherence  of  the  liquid  to  the  thermocouple  junction.  Note  that  video  recording  of 
combustion  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  examination  of  extinguished  specimens  of  nitramines 
indicate  the  presence  of  bubbles  in  the  subsurface  layer. 

However,  earlier  studies  showed  that  formal  analysis  of  extinguished  specimens  and  data  of  low- 
speed  movie  records  can  lead  to  incorrect  results.  For  example,  it  was  established  [65,  66]  that  the 
presence  of  developed  foam  on  the  surface  of  extinguished  specimens  of  double-base  propellants 
is  a  consequence  of  residual  gas  liberation  in  cooling.  At  the  same  time,  high-speed  movie  rec¬ 
ords  make  it  possible  to  detect,  on  a  burning  surface,  only  single  short-lived  bubbles  that  occupy 
less  than  10%  of  the  specimen  surface.  Similar  observations  made  by  U.S.  researchers,  showed 
that  the  “foam  layer”  appears  when  a  low-speed  camera  is  used  but  disappears  with  high-speed 
photography  [67]. 

Considerable  advances  have  been  made  in  the  description  of  the  chemical  mechanism  of  gas- 
phase  transformations  in  nitramine  combustion,  but  the  essence  and  relative  contribution  of  con- 


2—26 


densed-phase  reactions  still  remain  in  question.  For  better  understanding  of  the  mechanism  of 
physicochemical  transformations  in  the  combustion  wave,  adequate  physicomathematical  models 
of  nitramine  combustion  must  be  constructed  on  the  basis  of  a  critical  analysis  of  the  available 
information  and  a  combination  of  experimental  and  theoretical  approaches.  Literature  data  on  the 
thermal  decomposition  of  nitramines  that  are  of  interest  for  studying  chemical  processes  in  the 
combustion  wave  were  reviewed  elsewhere  [68]. 

In  thethis  section,  we  attempt  to  generalize  the  available  experimental  data  on  the  macrokinetic 
characteristics  of  RDX  and  HMX  combustion  waves  and  their  chemical  structures.  A  brief  re¬ 
view  of  the  available  mathematical  models  is  presented  and  reduction  of  the  mechanism  of  com¬ 
bustion  reactions  in  cyclic-nitramine  flames  is  discussed  later. 

Physical  parameters  of  the  combustion  wave 

As  follows  from  the  results  of  numerous  studies,  the  nitramine-combustion  wave  includes  several 
regions:  a  solid  nonreactive  substance,  a  melted  subsurface  layer,  a  narrow  zone  of  chemical  re¬ 
actions  beneath  the  burning  surface,  which  is  partially  filled  with  gas  bubbles,  a  zone  of  primary 
gas-phase  reactions,  an  induction  (dark)  zone,  and  a  zone  of  secondary  gas-phase  reactions.  In 
addition,  small  liquid  droplets  can  be  formed  as  a  result  of  bursting  the  bubbles  on  the  burning 
surface.  The  efforts  of  experimenters  are  usually  directed  toward  studying  the  temperature  pro¬ 
file  and  burning  rate  of  the  materials  in  question. 

One  of  the  first  attempts  at  a  detailed  study  of  the  combustion  wave  of  pressed  nitramine  speci¬ 
mens  was  undertaken  by  Mal’tsev  and  Pokhil  [69].  An  optical  method  was  used  to  measure  the 
temperature  distribution  as  a  function  of  pressure  at  various  distances  from  the  burning  surface 
(Table  2.10).  The  attenuation  of  radiation  in  flame  with  height  above  the  burning  surface  of 
RDX  was  measured  at  pressures  p  =  20, 40,  and  60  atm.

The  burning-surface  temperature  was  determined  [69]  by  extrapolation  of  the  temperature  profile 
data.  In  addition,  temperature  profiles  were  used  to  estimate  the  heat  Qc  released  in  the  con¬ 
densed  phase,  and  the  heat  feed  back  to  the  condensed  phase  from  the  gas  (Table  2.11):

Here  and  below,  p  is  the  specimen  density,  u  is  the  linear  burning  rate,  T  is  the  temperature,  X  is 
the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  gas  phase,  x  is  the  space  coordinate,  and  the  subscripts  c  and  s 
correspond  to  parameters  in  the  condensed  phase  and  on  the  burning  surface,  respectively.  The 
obtained  estimates  of  heat  release  indicate  that  the  condensed-phase  decomposition  is  endother- 
mal. 


The  temperature  profile  in  the  combustion  wave  of  pressed  RDX  specimens  was  measured  [70]  at 
p  =  1  -  90  atm  by  tungsten  -  rhenium  thermocouples  inserted  into  the  specimens.  The  tempera¬ 
ture  profile  was  used  to  determine  the  burning-surface  temperature,  the  heat  release  in  the  con¬ 
densed  and  gas  phases,  the  heat  flux  from  the  gas  phase  into  the  condensed  phase,  and  the  thick¬ 
ness  of  the  melted  layer.  It  was  found  that  the  heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase  was  negative 
at  p  <  5  -  10  atm  and  positive  at  p  >  10  atm.  Based  on  this,  it  was  concluded  that  vaporization  is 
dominant  at  low  pressures  while  thermal  decomposition  with  positive  heat  release  is  dominant  at 
high  pressures. 

Analysis  of  the  data  presented  in  Tables  2.10  and  2.11  indicates  that  the  numerical  values  of  the 
parameters  corresponding  to  the  specified  combustion  conditions  differ  considerably.  Unfortu¬ 
nately,  as  in  many  other  studies  of  the  combustion  of  energetic  materials,  the  authors  do  not  re- 


2—28 


port  estimates  of  the  confidence  intervals  of  the  measured  quantities,  and  this  makes  objective 
comparison  of  the  analyzed  results  difficult.  It  is  obvious  that,  along  with  procedural  errors,  such 
factors  as  the  density,  phase  composition,  and  purity  (presence  of  impurities)  of  the  materials 
studied  make  a  substantial  contribution  to  the  spread  in  the  measured  values.  It  is  possible,  there¬ 
fore,  that  energetic  materials  produced  at  different  times  and  in  different  places  will  have  differ¬ 
ent  combustion  parameters,  which  are  essential  in  discussing  fine  details  of  the  combustion-wave 
structure. 

Note  that  the  conventional  methods  for  measuring  the  mean  burning  rate  do  not  allow  recording 
local  (in  time)  pulsations  of  the  rate  of  motion  of  the  condensed-phase  surface.  However,  obser¬ 
vations  of  the  nature  of  flame  luminescence  and  dynamic  measurements  of  the  reactive  force  of 
the  combustion  products  show  that,  at  least  at  atmospheric  pressure,  RDX  bums  with  chaotic  pul¬ 
sations  at  a  frequency  exceeding  500  Hz  [74].  The  nature  of  these  pulsations  has  not  been  relia¬ 
bly  established,  nor  has  the  scale  of  their  effect  on  the  measured  mean  burning  rate. 

In  the  case  of  HMX  combustion,  a  characteristic  feature  associated  with  the  existence  of  various 
stable  crystalline  modifications  of  the  material  should  be  noted.  It  is  customary  to  assume  that 
commercial  HMX  consists  entirely  of  the  P-modification,  which  is  stable  from  room  temperature 
to  376  K.  It  was  shown  [75],  however,  that  when  the  P-modification  is  heated  to  a  temperature 
exceeding  435  K  (162°C  and  above),  the  8  -  modification  forms  which  is  capable  of  existing  for 
several  hours  at  normal  temperature.  This  means  that  occasionally  or  specially  heated  and  subse¬ 
quently  cooled  specimens  of  HMX  could  contain  a  considerable  fraction  of  the  8-modification. 
The  latter  has  increased  sensitivity  to  impact,  which  increases  the  danger  of  technological  opera¬ 
tions  with  that  material,  and  an  increased  burning  rate,  which  can  affect  the  overall  burning  rate 
of  the  mixture  of  crystals.  The  results  of  measurements  of  the  burning  rates  of  the  P  -  and  8- 
modifications  of  HMX  [75]  are  presented  in  Table  2.12  along  with  the  data  of  other  researchers 
on  combustion-wave  parameters  at  p  =  1  -  70  atm.  The  large  satter  of  the  data  on  the  burning 
rates  of  HMX  at  atmospheric  pressure  is  noteworthy.  It  should  be  borne  in  mind,  however,  that 
at  this  pressure  HMX  is  capable  of  burning  in  a  strikingly  expressed  self-oscillating  mode  [74], 
and  this  can  affect  the  measured  pseudo  stationary  burning  rate. 

The  data  in  Tables  2.1 1  and  2.12  contain  inconsistent  information  on  the  relative  role  of  the  con¬ 
tributions  of  exothermic  transformations  in  the  condensed  and  gas  phases  to  the  energy  balance 
on  the  burning  surface.  According  to  [70],  for  both  RDX  and  HMX  at  relatively  low  pressures  (p 
=  1-5  atm),  endothermal  processes  take  place  in  the  condensed  phase,  and  the  combustion  wave 
is  maintained  chiefly  by  heat  release  in  the  flame.  At  p  >  50  atm,  however,  heat  release  in  the 
condensed  phase  becomes  dominant.  At  the  same  time,  there  are  data  for  RDX  [69]  and  for 
HMX  [77]  that  do  not  agree  with  the  tendency  indicated  above.  Obviously,  the  limited  set  of  ex¬ 
perimental  data  does  not  permit  one  to  arrive  at  final  conclusions  on  the  mechanism  of  nitramine 
combustion  over  a  wide  pressure  range. 

In  general,  despite  the  relative  similarity  of  the  mechanism  of  RDX  and  HMX  combustion,  i.e., 
the  small  difference  in  the  combustion  laws  log  u  =  const  +  v  log  p,  there  are  serious  differences 
in  their  responses  to  variations  of  initial  temperature  and  dynamic  oscillations  of  the  external  heat 
flux.  For  example,  according  to  [79],  for  RDX  at  p  =  10  - 100  atm,  the  temperature  sensitivity  of 
the  burning  rate  P  =  (d  In  u  /  t)To)p  is  extremely  low  and  equals  (1  -  2)  10'3  K"1,  while  for  HMX,

(3  =  5  10'3  K"1  at  low  pressure  (p  =  10  atm)  and  drops  to  10’3  K’1  at  p  =  50  -  100  atm.  It  is  impor¬ 
tant  to  bear  in  mind  that  exact  measurements  of  (3  at  a  level  of  10'3  K'1  are  difficult  to  perform;  the 
relative  error  rises  to  100%  or  more.

Notes.  The  values  ofTs  in  [77]  correspond  to  the  initial  temperature  of  intense  condensed-phase 
decomposition  [discontinuity  in  profile  ofT  (x)].  The  values  ofQc  in  [70]  where  calculated  by  the 
equation  Qc  =  c  (Ts  -  T0)  -  Qg+  Qm  -  Qmd,  where  Qg  =  (A/ pu)(dT/dx)s,  and  Qm  and  Qrad  are  the 
heat  expenditures  for  melting  and  heat  feedback  due  to  the  emission  from  the  flame,  respectively. 
The  values  of  Qc  in  [77]  were  calculated  by  a  similar  equation  for  (Qm  -  Qg)  =  0. 


The  burning  rate  (reactive  force)  response  at  atmospheric  pressure  to  perturbations  of  the  radia¬ 
tion  flux  for  RDX  has  a  weakly  expressed  resonance  character  (fres  =  6  Hz),  while  HMX  is  capa¬ 
ble  of  burning  in  a  self-sustained  regime  with  regular  nonlinear  burning-rate  oscillations  with  a 
frequency  of  3  -  5  Hz.  An  important  characteristic  of  RDX  combustion  in  air  is  an  anomalously 
wide  melt  zone,  which  can  be  recorded  by  a  thermocouple  method.  In  theoretical  modeling  of 
stationary  combustion,  this  effect  is  sometimes  described  using  a  higher  value  of  thermal  con¬ 
ductivity  for  the  melted  layer  than  for  the  crystalline  phase.  It  seems  that  this  approach  is  incon¬ 
sistent  with  the  experimentally  observed  bubble  formation  in  the  liquid  layer,  which  can  only  re- 


duce  the  effective  thermal  conductivity.  A  decrease  in  the  average  density  of  the  condensed 
phase  of  RDX  as  the  burning  surface  is  approached  from  the  cold  end  was  recorded  by  exposure 
of  the  specimen  with  x-rays  [80].  This  information  does  not  yet  have  independent  confirmation; 
experimental  research  must  be  continued  to  substantiate  the  data  on  the  density  of  burning  nitra- 
mines.  For  example,  it  can  be  expected  that  for  the  combustion  of  HMX,  whose  melting  point  is 
almost  80  K  higher  than  that  of  RDX  and  whose  melt  zone  is  correspondingly  narrower,  the  ef¬ 
fects  of  gas  liberation  in  the  liquid  layer  must  be  relatively  insignificant. 

Flame  chemical  structure 

Data  on  flame  chemical  structure  are  extremely  important  from  the  point  of  view  of  verification 
and  substantiation  of  model  theoretical  concepts,  which  at  present  make  it  possible  to  calculate 
the  concentration  profiles  of  a  large  number  of  gas  components.  Here  one  should  always  bear  in 
mind  the  difficulties  of  objective  comparison  with  the  results  of  laboratory  experiments  per¬ 
formed  on  specimens  with  finite  dimensions  under  conditions  of  various  kinds  of  boundary  ef¬ 
fects  and  heat  transfer.  The  task  of  the  experimenter,  therefore,  is  to  make  the  experimental  con¬ 
ditions  as  close  as  possible  to  the  one-dimensional  conditions  that  are  usually  adopted  in  theory. 

Spectroscopic  and  mass-spectrometric  methods  are  traditionally  employed  to  study  flame  chemi¬ 
cal  structure.  Probably,  the  simplest  method  for  recording  gas  components  in  flame  is  the  one  of 
measuring  their  luminescence  intensities.  However,  problems  with  interpretation  of  the  experi¬ 
mental  data  can  arise  in  this  case,  since  chemical  reactions  in  flames  produce  molecules  in  a  non¬ 
equilibrium  state.  As  noted  in  [81],  chemical  luminescence  is  usually  caused  by  excited  elec¬ 
tronic  states  formed  in  secondary  reactions  that  do  not  correspond  to  the  main  energy  mechanism 
of  flame  reactions.  The  possible  effects  of  chemical  luminescence  must  be  analyzed  with  allow¬ 
ance  for  the  characteristics  of  specific  flames.  In  particular,  this  effect  does  not  permit  the  effec¬ 
tive  concentration  of  the  OH  radical  in  the  ground  state  to  be  determined  in  solid-propellant 
flames  [81].  At  the  same  time,  in  a  nitromethane  flame  the  emission  of  the  OH  and  NH  radicals 
has  a  purely  thermal  nature,  but  the  emission  of  the  CN  radical  clearly  demonstrates  a  chemical 
nature  (the  vibrational  temperature  exceeds  the  rotational  by  a  factor  of  2)  [82].  Planar  laser- 
induced  fluorescence  (PLIF)  appears  very  effective  but  fairly  complicated  to  implement.  A 
pulsed  “laser  sheet”  (a  flat  beam  100  -  200  pm  thick)  excites  the  gas  components  in  the  flame  of 
a  burning  specimen,  and  a  high-resolution  video  camera  records  the  emission  intensity  of  the  ex¬ 
cited  ground  states  of  the  gas  species.  The  maximum  resolution  on  the  camera  screen  (=  5  pm) 
allows  the  PLIF  method  to  be  used  successfully  to  study  the  flames  of  various  materials,  includ¬ 
ing  nitramines.  A  simpler  optical  method  based  on  measurement  of  selective  absorption  is  widely 
used  along  with  PLIF.  Here,  however,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the  contributions  from 
flame  zones  with  different  temperatures,  and  this  is  an  independent  difficult  problem. 

Unlike  contactless  optical  methods,  mass  spectrometry  is  based  on  sampling  of  the  gas  with  sub¬ 
sequent  analysis  of  its  composition.  An  important  advantage  of  mass  spectrometry  over  spec¬ 
troscopy  is  the  possibility  of  analysis  of  a  wider  range  of  substances.  At  the  same  time,  the  con¬ 
tact  nature  of  the  method  causes  serious  difficulties  in  recording  highly  reactive  components  (at¬ 
oms  and  radicals)  and  in  correcting  for  the  disturbing  action  of  the  probe. 

One  of  the  first  studies  of  flame  chemical  structure  was  published  in  1973  [83].  The  relative 
emission  intensities  of  OH,  C2,  CN,  CH,  H2,  02,  and  N2  were  measured  along  the  height  of  an 


2—31 


RDX  flame  burning  at  p  =  30  atm.  It  was  found  that  the  intensity  of  OH  emission  rose  sharply 
near  the  surface  (at  a  distance  of  =  100  pm)  and  then  was  held  at  nearly  a  constant  level  in  the 
flame.  The  intensity  of  CN  and  CH  luminescence  rises  gradually  and  then  remains  at  an  almost 
constant  level  in  the  flame.  The  maximum  measured  flame  temperature,  which  was  2500  K,  was 
achieved  at  a  height  of  0.3  mm  from  the  burning  surface.  In  the  regions  of  5200  -  6000  and  3400 
-  4500  A,  continuous  spectra  were  recorded  which  are  attributed  to  the  reactions  NO  +  O  — » 
NO2  +  h  v  and  CO  +  O  -»  CO2  +  h  v,  respectively  (hv  is  the  quantum  energy). 

The  further  development  of  spectrometric  methods  has  considerably  increased  the  reliability  and 
information  content  of  experimental  data.  Results  of  studies  of  RDX  flames  in  air  are  presented 
in  [81].  Pressed  pellets  (with  a  density  of  95  -  98  %  of  the  crystal  density)  were  burned  in  a  self- 
sustained  regime  and  under  the  action  of  a  CO2  laser.  In  the  latter  case,  combustion  was  consid¬ 
erably  nonuniform  over  the  surface,  owing  to  the  bell-shaped  cross-sectional  energy  distribution 
of  the  laser  beam,  and  the  temperature  profile  was  characterized  by  the  presence  of  a  “plateau”, 
i.e.,  a  flame  structure  with  two  temperature  zones  was  formed. 

In  the  self-sustaining  combustion  regime,  the  PLIF  method  was  used  to  measure  the  relative  NO, 
OH,  CN,  and  NH  concentrations  at  various  distances  from  the  burning  surface.  Absolute  values 
of  the  concentrations  were  obtained  by  absorption  measurements  in  the  ultraviolet  and  visible  re¬ 
gions  of  the  spectrum.  The  concentrations  were  310  and  260  ppm  for  CN  and  NH,  17  and  3.6  % 
for  NO  and  OH,  and  less  than  1  %  for  H2CO  and  HONO.  The  N02  concentration  could  not  be 
measured  because  of  the  rapid  disappearance  of  this  component  near  the  burning  surface.  The 
temperature  profile  was  obtained  by  a  combined  method:  in  the  condensed  phase  and  at  a  height 
of  0.3  mm  above  the  surface  by  means  of  5 -pm  thermocouples;  and  in  the  gas  phase  up  to  the 
maximum  temperature  by  processing  the  rotational-temperature  profile  of  the  OH  radical.  Proc¬ 
essing  of  temperature  and  concentration  profiles  of  the  gas  components  showed  that  maximum 
heat  release  in  the  flame  correlates  well  with  the  maximum  CN  concentration  (this  is  confirmed 
by  observations  of  other  flames).  This  allows  the  CN  concentration  profile  to  be  invoked  to  de¬ 
termine  the  “flame  stand  off  distance”  —  an  approximate  quantitative  characteristic  used  to  com¬ 
pare  the  energy  intensities  of  different  flames  and  in  semi-empirical  burning  rate  calculations. 
According  to  the  data  of  [81],  the  flame  standoff  distance  increases  under  CO2  laser  radiation, 
which  is  absorbed  in  a  narrow  surface  layer  of  RDX.  This  results  in  the  appearance  of  a  dark  zone 
near  the  surface  and  the  formation  of  more  extended  zones  of  NO2  and  NO  concentration  varia¬ 
tion.  Hanson-Parr  and  Parr  [81]  believe  that  large  quantities  of  NO  and  N02  indicate  the  domi¬ 
nant  role  of  breaking  the  N — NO2  bond  in  the  RDX  molecules.  In  addition,  the  fact  that  the 
maximum  N02  concentration  is  established  at  a  finite  distance  from  the  burning  surface  is  inter¬ 
preted  as  evidence  of  the  presence  of  RDX  vapors  above  the  burning  surface. 

Spectroscopic  flame  measurements  permit  only  indirect  evaluation  of  condensed-phase  reac¬ 
tions,  which  are  largely  masked  by  fast  gas-phase  reactions  near  the  burning  surface.  An  original 
attempt  to  determine  the  primary  products  of  condensed-phase  decomposition  by  absorption- 
spectrum  recording  was  made  by  Wormhoudt  et  al.  [84].  Fiber  light  guides  transparent  at  wave¬ 
lengths  of  2  -  5  pm  were  inserted  into  an  opening  parallel  to  the  specimen  surface  to  be  ignited 
at  a  distance  of  a  few  millimeters  from  it.  As  the  burning  surface  approached  the  opening,  the 
intensity  of  N20  absorption  was  continuously  recorded.  Simultaneously,  the  temperature  near  the 
opening  was  measured  by  a  thermocouple  made  of  Chromel— Alumel  wire  127  pm  in  diameter.

The  link  to  the  temperature  profile  was  rather  approximate  because  of  uncertainty  of  the  location 
of  the  thermocouples  and  their  large  diameter.  A  sharp  rise  in  the  N2O  concentration  is  observed 
at  relatively  low  temperatures  (100  -  150  °C),  at  which  the  onset  of  intense  reactions  in  the  con¬ 
densed  phase  is  hardly  possible.  It  is  concluded  that  N2O  is  formed  in  the  more-heated  layers  of 
the  condensed  phase  as  a  result  of  secondary  gas  reactions  in  bubbles.  The  disrupture  of  bubbles 
toward  the  cold  end  can  occur  when  the  specimen  have  cracks,  which  the  authors  observed  in  a 
visual  study  of  longitudinal  sections  of  starting  specimens.  It  is  intended  to  continue  the  work  on 
the  designed  installation  by  performing  simultaneous  measurements  of  the  NO2  and  NO  concen¬ 
trations. 

Mass  spectrometry  was  used  for  the  first  time  to  study  nitramine  flames  at  the  end  of  the  1960s. 
Bemecker  and  Smith  [23]  studied  the  products  of  RDX  and  HMX  combustion  at  p  =  0.1  -  12 
MPa.  It  was  established  that  the  principal  final  combustion  products  were  in  practically  the  same 
ratio  for  both  materials  (N2  :  CO:  CO2  :  H2  :  H2  O  =  3:2: 1:1:2),  which  changes  little  at  p  >  2.5 
MPa.  NO,  N2O,  and  HCN  were  detected  in  small  amounts.  Formaldehyde  CH2O  was  not  found 
in  RDX  combustion  and  was  detected  only  in  minor  amounts  in  HMX  combustion  at  atmospheric 
pressure. 

Considerably  more  complete  information  on  the  chemical  structure  of  the  zone  of  gas-phase  re¬ 
actions  in  nitramine  flames  was  obtained  later  [86-88]  by  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry.  Use 
of  miniature  quartz  conical  probes  with  a  0.1-mm  opening  and  a  tip  outside  diameter  of  0.3  mm 
permitted  the  detailed  study  of  the  transformation  zone  of  intermediate  products  of  condensed- 
phase  decomposition.  The  space  distribution  of  concentrations  for  the  gas  components  was 
measured  when  the  burning  specimen  was  moved  toward  the  probe.  The  data  corresponding  to 
small  (less  than  0.1  mm)  distances  from  the  probe  end  to  the  burning  surface  were  not  analyzed 
because  of  the  uncertainty  of  exact  location  of  the  probe  end  and  because  of  the  possibility  that 
droplets  of  the  melted  material  could  strike  the  probe. 

The  results  of  mass-spectrometric  studies  of  RDX  flames  are  summarized  in  [87,  88].  RDX 
specimens  10  mm  in  diameter  and  20  mm  long  were  compressed  from  50-pm  particles  to  a  den¬ 
sity  of  1.8  g/cm3.  Combustion  was  produced  in  argon  at  p  =  0.05  MPa.  Combustion  was  stable 
with  a  rate  of  0.25  mm/sec.  The  burning  surface  of  the  specimens,  which  were  extinguished  by 
fast  depressurization,  was  fairly  smooth:  the  unevenness  in  an  area  8  mm  in  diameter  did  not  ex¬ 
ceed  0.1  mm.  A  peak  at  m/e  =  75  (RDX,  fragmentary)  was  recorded  at  distances  x  <  0.1  mm 
from  the  burning  surface.  This  could  be  due  to  vapor  or  liquid  RDX  that  was  sucked  into  the 
probe  (m/e  is  the  ratio  of  the  molar  mass  of  the  species  to  the  degree  of  ionization).  From  an 
analysis  of  the  experimental  data,  Korobeinichev  et  al.  [87]  and  Kuibida  [88]  concluded  that  the 
RDX  flame,  as  asserted  earlier  [89],  consists  of  two  zones.  The  narrow  cold  flame  region  adja¬ 
cent  to  the  burning  surface  (x  <  0.1  mm,  estimated  from  the  width  of  the  decomposition  zone  of 
RDX  vapor)  has  a  temperature  of  ~  1 100  K.  Because  of  its  smallness  and  the  imposition  of  the 
process  of  probe  interaction  with  the  liquid  surface  layer  of  RDX,  this  region  was  not  studied. 
After  the  first  is  a  wide  (~  2  mm)  reaction  zone  of  the  intermediate  products  formed  in  reactions 
in  the  narrow  zone.  The  following  peaks  were  recorded  in  this  wide  luminescent  flame  region: 
I14  (N2,  N02,  NO,  N20,  HCN),  I28  (CO,  N2,  N20,  C02,  CH20),  I30  (NO,  N02,  N20,  CH20),  I29 
(CH20),  I27  (HCN),  I44  (N20,  C02),  I46  (N02),  I43  (HNCO),  I42  (NCO),  I18  (H20),  and  I2  (H2). 
Molecules  from  which  ions  of  the  given  mass  could  be  formed  are  shown  in  parentheses.  The 


component  with  m/e  =  43  can  exist  in  three  forms:  HCNO,  HNCO,  and  HOCN.  It  is  shown  [35] 
that  only  HNCO  exists  in  the  gas  phase  at  room  temperature. 

According  to  [25,  26],  the  main  products  of  the  cold  flame  zone  are  not  NO2  and  CH2O,  as  was 
assumed  in  [27,  29,  30],  but  NO  and  HCN,  and  the  subsequent  reactions  of  the  latter  determine 
the  chemical  structure  of  the  luminescent  zone  of  the  RDX  flame. 

The  combustion  of  pressed  RDX  pellets  in  argon  at  p  =  1  atm  assisted  by  C02-laser  radiation 
with  an  intensity  of  400  W/cm2  was  studied  by  Litzinger  et  al.  [92].  Concentration  profiles  of  the 
stable  components  were  obtained  by  a  mass-spectrometric  method  in  the  gas  phase.  The  space 
resolution  of  the  method  using  a  quartz  probe  with  a  30-pm  opening  was  estimated  by  the  authors 
at  100  -  150  pm.  During  the  experiment,  the  specimen  was  moved  toward  the  probe  at  a  con¬ 
trolled  speed  by  means  of  a  mechanical  drive.  The  distance  from  the  burning  surface  to  the  probe 
tip  was  monitored  by  a  video  camera.  The  standoff  distance  of  the  luminescent  (violet)  flame  in 
laser-assisted  combustion  was  =  5  mm  with  oscillations  of  1  mm  about  the  mean  position.  On 
the  burning  surface,  bubbles  were  recorded  that  were  considerably  smaller  (~  100  pm)  than  in 
combustion  with  weak  heat  supply  or  in  pyrolysis  in  vacuum. 

Quantitative  data  were  presented  on  the  gas-species  concentrations  at  heights  of  0  -  5  mm  above 
the  burning  surface.  Substances  typical  of  RDX  thermal  decomposition  were  detected:  NO2,  NO, 
N2O,  HCN,  H2O,  N2,  CO,  CO2,  and  H2.  The  appearance  of  a  peak  corresponding  to  m/e  =  29  was 
initially  explained  by  CH2O  decomposition  in  the  ion  source.  However,  experiments  with  a  triple 
quadruple  mass  spectrometer  showed  that  an  ion  with  that  mass  is  formed  by  another  substance. 
In  addition,  according  to  spectroscopic  measurements  [81],  the  CH2O  concentration  in  the  flame 
is  very  low.  Therefore,  data  on  the  CH2O  concentration  were  not  given  in  [92].  Nor  do  Litzinger 
et  al.  [92]  consider  correction  of  the  measured  values  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  burning 
surface,  just  as  in  the  distant  zones  of  the  flame.  Comparison  with  the  NO  and  N2O  concentra¬ 
tion  profiles  obtained  under  the  same  combustion  conditions  by  the  PLIF  method  [81]  showed 
fair  qualitative  and  quantitative  agreement  between  independent  experimental  data.  According  to 
[92],  in  a  narrow  zone  on  the  order  of  0.5  mm  above  the  surface,  the  NO2  and  HCN  concentra¬ 
tions  drop  rapidly,  the  NO  and  H2O  concentrations  rise,  and  the  CO  and  N2O  concentrations  vary 
extremely  weakly.  The  CO2  concentration  at  the  surface  is  vanishingly  small  and  becomes  ap¬ 
preciable  only  at  a  height  of  1.5  -  2  mm.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  all  these  data  were  ob¬ 
tained  under  combustion  conditions  with  a  powerful  external  heat  supply  and  correspond  to  a 
combustion  wave  with  the  flame  greatly  removed  from  the  surface.  Moreover,  laser  radiation 
leads  to  uncontrollable  heating  of  the  probe  and,  as  a  consequence,  to  additional  perturbation  of 
the  flame-zone  structure.  For  this  reason,  comparisons  of  the  experimental  data  of  [92]  even  with 
the  data  of  spectroscopic  studies  under  similar  combustion  conditions  [81]  should  be  performed 
with  caution,  and  comparisons  with  the  data  on  self-sustained  combustion  [87,  88]  are  simply  not 
valid,  due  to  great  differences  in  the  experimental  conditions.  Attempts  to  bring  about  a  relative 
mass  balance  (the  total  ratio  of  atoms  in  the  measured  components)  have  not  been  successful.  In 
this  connection,  Litzinger  et  al.  [92]  correctly  note  that  good  quantitative  agreement  of  the  ob¬ 
tained  experimental  data  with  the  results  of  theoretical  calculations  should  not  be  expected. 

A  spectroscopic  study  of  the  chemical  structure  of  a  HMX  flame  at  atmospheric  and  higher  pres¬ 
sures  was  performed  [71]  using  the  PLIF  method.  It  was  found  that  self-sustained  combustion  at 


2—34 


p  =  1  atm  has  a  fluctuating  nature  and  above  the  burning  surface  there  is  a  zone  containing  drop¬ 
lets  of  liquid  HMX  (the  mechanism  of  droplet  formation  was  not  investigated).  Measurement  of 
the  NO  concentration  in  this  zone  is  impossible  because  of  spectrum  overlap.  Time  fluctuations 
did  not  permit  measuring  the  space  distribution  of  the  component  concentrations  in  the  flame, 
but  their  maximum  values  were  obtained:  =  6.5  %  for  H2CO  and  NO2,  3.6  %  for  OH,  and  210 
ppm  for  CN.  HMX  combustion  under  the  action  of  a  continuous  CO2  laser  flux  (400  W/cm2) 
proceeds  in  a  regime  with  a  distant  secondary  flame.  The  flame  stand  off  distance  measured  by 
CN  luminescence  varies  from  4  to  =  0.2  mm  as  the  pressure  increases  from  1  to  12  atm.  The 
flame  “thickness”  varies  from  4.5  to  0.5  mm  in  this  case. 

Mass-spectrometric  probing  of  HMX  flames  at  nitrogen  pressures  of  0.05  and  0.1  MPa  was  per¬ 
formed  by  Korobeinichev  et  al.  [86]  and  Kuibida  [88].  The  burning  rates  of  the  specimens  were 
0.2  and  0.45  mm/sec,  and  their  density  was  1.76  g/cm3.  At  lower  pressures,  fluctuations  of  the 
intensities  of  the  recorded  peaks  were  observed.  At  p  =  0.1  MPa,  peaks  with  m/e  =  2  (H2),  18 
(H20),  27  (HCN),  28  (N2,  CO),  29  (CH20),  30  (NO,  N20,  N02,  H2CO),  43  (HNCO),  44  (N20, 
CO2),  46  (NO2),  and  75  (HMX,  fragmentary)  were  measured  as  a  function  of  the  distance  x  to  the 
burning  surface.  The  CH2O  and  NO2  concentrations  drop  to  zero  with  an  increase  in  x.  The  in¬ 
tensity  of  the  HCN  peak  reaches  a  maximum  at  x  =  0.6  (the  point  at  which  CH2O  and  NO2  dis¬ 
appear)  and  then  drops  to  zero  at  x=1.2  mm.  The  presence  of  a  peak  with  m/e  =  42  (NCO)  sug¬ 
gests  the  presence  of  molecules  of  isocyanic  acid  HN=C=0  in  the  flame.  The  peak  with  m/e  = 
75  was  recorded  at  a  distance  of  a  few  tens  of  micrometers  from  the  burning  surface. 

According  to  the  experimental  data  of  [22,  50,  86-88,  93],  the  main  products  of  nitramine  decom¬ 
position  are  CH20,  N02,  NO,  N2O,  and  HCN.  Therefore,  efforts  have  been  directed  toward 
studying  the  reactions 

N02  +  CH20  (I);  N2O  +  CH2O  (II);  N02  +  HCN  (III). 

Studies  [91,  94,  95]  were  performed  by  spectroscopic  methods  in  shock  waves.  This  limited  the 
volume  of  obtained  information.  Experimental  results  were  interpreted  in  terms  of  a  simple  un¬ 
branched  reaction.  The  rates  of  decrease  in  NO2  and  N2O  were  used  to  determine  the  rate  con¬ 
stants  of  the  global  stages  (I  -  III).  Results  of  a  calculation  performed  on  the  basis  of  a  multistage 
mechanism  [91]  indicate  that  reaction  III  proceeds  in  two  steps.  The  first  step  involves  con¬ 
sumption  of  NO2  and  an  increase  in  the  molar  fraction  of  NO,  and  the  second  involves  a  reaction 
of  NO  with  HCN.  More  complete  data  were  obtained  in  the  experiments  of  [96,  97]  with  a  flat 
burner.  The  combustion  of  an  HCN/N02  mixture  at  p  =  25  torr  and  a  mass  flow  rate  of  0.0013 
g/(cm2  sec)  was  studied.  The  main  combustion  products,  as  detected  by  the  FTIR  method  (infra¬ 
red  spectrometry  with  Fourier  transform),  were  NO,  CO,  CO2,  and  H2O.  The  CO  concentration 
was  measured  as  a  function  of  the  distance  from  the  burner  edge.  The  temperature  profile  in  the 
flame  was  determined  from  the  CO  vibrational  temperature.  The  flame  thickness,  as  determined 
by  the  criterion  dT/dx  >  0,  was  =  6  mm.  Based  on  processing  of  experimental  data  and  analysis 
of  the  chemical  mechanism,  a  reaction  scheme  was  proposed  that  was  recommended  by  Thome 
and  Melius  [97]  as  a  submechanism  for  the  study  of  nitramine  flames.

Mathematical  modeling 

One  of  the  first  studies  on  the  modeling  of  combustion  processes  of  melted  or  liquid  volatile  en¬ 
ergetic  substances  was  carried  out  more  than  60  years  ago  at  the  Institute  of  Chemical  Physics, 
Moscow  [63].  A  distinguishing  feature  of  this  and  numerous  subsequent  studies  was  the  as¬ 
sumption  of  a  single  global  exothermic  reaction  that  determined  the  rate  of  heat  release  and,  ac¬ 
cordingly,  the  burning  rate.  Based  on  general,  often  qualitative,  physical  considerations,  the  lo¬ 
cation  of  this  reaction  was  specified  in  the  combustion  wave,  and  this  determined  whether  burn¬ 
ing  rate  controlling  stage  is  in  the  gas  or  liquid  phase.  The  required  kinetic  parameters  were  se¬ 
lected  on  the  basis  of  a  priori  considerations,  the  structure  of  the  molecules,  and  the  global 
chemical  equations  of  the  reaction,  or  by  solving  inverse  problems  of  the  thermal  theories  of  ig¬ 
nition  and  combustion. 


At  the  present  time,  it  is  known  [98,  99]  that  agreement  between  calculated  and  measured  burning 
rates  can  be  achieved  even  on  the  basis  of  fundamentally  different  theoretical  premises,  since 
combustion  models  contain  a  large  number  of  matching  parameters,  primarily  the  coefficients  of 
global  chemical  reactions.  Therefore,  the  problem  is  one  of  direct  experimental  substantiation  of 
the  assumptions  made.  Moreover,  it  is  stated  [100]  that  comparison  with  experimental  data  must 
be  performed  not  only  for  the  burning  rate  and  its  dependence  on  pressure,  but  also  for  its  de¬ 
pendence  on  the  initial  temperature,  which  is  more  sensitive  to  the  parameters  of  the  problem, 
and  for  the  space  distributions  of  the  temperature  and  component  concentrations  in  the  combus¬ 
tion  wave. 


Early  models  did  not  show  a  deep  understanding  of  the  physical  processes  in  the  combustion 
waves  of  melted  energetic  substances.  In  pioneering  studies  [63,  101],  a  fundamental  concept  of 
the  combustion  mechanism  of  volatile  energetic  materials  at  low  and  moderate  pressures  was 
formulated  according  to  which  vaporization  of  the  substances  occurs  with  a  considerably  higher 
probability  than  the  condensed-phase  reaction,  and  the  mass  rate  of  vaporization  under  steady 
conditions  is  equal  to  the  mass  rate  of  vapor  combustion.  The  latter  can  be  calculated  from  for¬ 
mulas  of  the  theory  of  combustion  in  gases  [102].  In  particular,  if  it  is  assumed  that  vaporization 
of  a  liquid  energetic  material  occurs  on  the  surface  while  a  mono-molecular  reaction  proceeds  in 
the  gas  phase,  for  the  mass  burning  rate  pu  we  obtain  [63]  formula

Here  Tmax  =  To  +  Q/cg  is  the  maximum  temperature  in  the  gas,  and  the  total  thermal  effect  Q  in¬ 
cludes  the  latent  heat  of  vaporization  of  the  energetic  material;  Ag  and  Eg  are  the  pre-exponent 
and  activation  energy  of  a  reaction  in  the  gas;  pg ,  X  g  ,  and  c  g  are  the  density,  thermal  conduc¬ 
tivity,  and  specific  heat  of  the  gas  at  T  =  Tmax.  The  boiling  point  of  the  liquid  energetic  material 
does  not  enter  in  formula  (2.12),  since  it  is  not  the  determining  parameters  of  the  problem  in  the 
case  of  a  rate  controlling  gas  phase.  The  same  paper,  with  a  reference  to  Ya.  B.  Zeldovich,  who 
published  a  derivation  and  analysis  of  the  formula  4  years  later  [103]),  gives  a  formula  for  com¬ 
bustion  of  liquid  energetic  materials  at  elevated  pressures,  at  which  the  probability  of  an  exo¬ 
thermic  reaction  in  the  condensed  phase  can  become  considerably  higher  owing  to  an  increase  in 
the  boiling  point  Tb:

Formula  (2.13)  defines  an  exponential  dependence  of  the  burning  rate  on  the  boiling  point  Tb  and 
predicts  a  strong  dependence  on  pressure:  dlnpu  /  dlnp  =  EC/2L,  where  L  is  the  latent  heat  of  va¬ 
porization.  We  note  that  [103]  contains  a  warning  about  the  use  of  the  expression  (EC/2L)  with  L 
=  const  for  high  pressures,  close  to  critical  ones  for  the  existence  of  a  liquid  phase.  The  simple 
formula  for  the  vapor  pressure  above  the  surface  of  a  heated  liquid  in  the  form  p  =  const  exp(- 
L/R  T)  should  also  be  used  with  caution,  since  the  value  of  L  is  reduced  as  the  liquid  temperature 
is  increased. 


Various  models  for  the  combustion  of  melted  energetic  materials  with  a  global  single-stage 
chemical  mechanism  have  been  published  [104—106],  in  which  particular  regularities  of  the  pro¬ 
cess  have  been  refined.  The  further  development  of  the  concepts  of  the  combustion  of  energetic 
materials  based  on  experimental  results  has  led  to  studies  of  multistage  chemical  transformations 
in  combustion  waves.  The  pioneering  work  in  this  area,  which  is  characterized  by  an  expanded 
global  mechanism  of  chemical  reactions,  was  performed  by  V.  N.  Vilyunov  [107].  He  proposed 
a  three-stage  scheme  for  the  reaction  of  energetic  materials  in  combustion  waves:  the  initial  trans¬ 
formation  takes  place  in  the  condensed  phase  and  is  followed  by  a  transformation  of  intermedi¬ 
ate  products  from  the  condensed-phase  decomposition  and  the  final  transformation  of  the  inter¬ 
mediate  compounds  into  combustion  products.  The  burning  rate  was  calculated  analytically  by 
the  approximate  Zeldovich  -  Frank-Kamenetskii  method.  Subsequently,  the  idea  of  multistage 
chemical  transformations  was  used  successfully  [108]  for  the  more  complex  case  of  the  combus¬ 
tion  of  energetic  materials  with  a  phase  transition  on  the  surface  (vaporization,  sublimation).  It 
was  assumed  that  independent  global  chemical  reactions  of  the  first  order  proceeded  in  the  con¬ 
densed  and  gas  phases.  In  the  pores  of  decomposing  material,  vapor  is  formed  by  an  equilibrium 
mechanism  with  subsequent  exothermic  transformation  of  the  vapor  into  final  combustion  prod¬ 
ucts.  The  vaporized  energetic  material  in  the  flame  above  the  surface  undergoes  a  similar  trans¬ 
formation.  The  condensed-phase  reaction  also  leads  to  formation  of  final  combustion  products. 
The  problem  was  solved  numerically.  It  was  found  that,  depending  on  the  numerical  values  of 
the  determining  parameters,  there  are  combustion  regimes  with  rate  controlling  reactions  (which 
determine  the  burning  rate  almost  completely)  in  both  the  condensed  and  gas  phases.  Moreover, 
calculations  showed  that  there  is  also  a  mixed  combustion  regime,  in  which  the  burning  rate  is 
approximately  equal  to  the  sum  (with  an  error  not  more  than  15  %)  of  the  rates  of  purely  solid- 
phase  and  gas-phase  combustion.  The  pressure  exponent  in  the  burning-rate  law  in  the  mixed 
regime  is  equal  to  the  half-sum  of  the  exponents  in  the  laws  for  the  solid-phase  and  gas-phase  re¬ 
gimes,  and  the  initial  temperature  burning  rate  coefficient  takes  an  intermediate  value  for  single¬ 
zone  combustion  regimes. 

Simultaneously  with  [108],  a  model  of  RDX  combustion  based  on  a  global  mechanism  of  two 
successive  chemical  reactions  was  published  [89].  It  involves  partial  decomposition  in  the  liquid 
phase  and  simultaneous  vaporization  of  the  remaining  initial  RDX  from  the  burning  surface.  The 
intermediate  decomposition  products  react  in  the  gas  phase  to  the  final  combustion  products. 
RDX  decomposition  in  both  the  liquid  and  gas  phases  is  described  by  the  first-order  reaction 

RDX  -»  1.5  N2  +  N20  +  N02  +  3  CH20  (2.14) 

with  the  following  kinetic  parameters  for  each  phase: 


2—37 


k3>  Uq  =  3  1018  exp(-41500/RT)  sec1  [37];  k3,gas  =  3.16  1015  exp(-41500/RT)  sec'1  [59] 

The  secondary  reaction  between  the  decomposition  products  is  described  as 

5/7  CH20  +  N02  -»  NO  +  2/7  C02  +  3/7  CO  +  5/7  H20  (2.15) 

Two  sets  of  constants  were  examined  for  reaction  (4): 

k4  =  109  exp(-19000/RT) ,  liter/(mol  sec)  which  was  obtained  in  [109]  for  T  ~  430  K,  and 
k4  =  1.26  1010  exp(-26700/RT) ,  liter/(mol  sec)  which  was  obtained  in  shock-tube  experiments  at 
T=970  -  1470  K. 

Estimates  of  the  characteristic  times  for  gas-phase  chemical  reactions  (2.14)  and  (2.15)  have 
shown  that  the  reaction  of  RDX-vapor  decomposition  is  completed  about  100  times  faster  than 
the  reaction  to  the  final  products.  Accordingly,  the  chemical  structure  of  the  gas-phase  flame 
consists  of  internal  and  external  zones.  The  internal  zone  exerts  a  real  effect  on  the  heat  feed 
back  to  the  burning  surface,  especially  at  relatively  low  pressures.  For  example,  in  calculations 
in  which  the  rate  of  the  secondary  reaction  was  artificially  reduced  by  a  factor  of  10,  the  total  heat 
flux  from  the  flame  changed  by  7,  11,  and  16  %  at  p  =  10,  20,  and  40  atm,  respectively.  There¬ 
fore,  primary  attention  in  numerical  modeling  was  given  to  a  calculation  of  the  combustion-wave 
parameters  in  the  internal  (adjacent  to  the  surface)  zone  of  the  flame. 

For  the  kinetic  constants  used  in  the  calculations,  it  was  found  that  the  width  of  the  RDX-vapor 
decomposition  zone  above  the  surface  at  p  =  10-40  atm  was  only  5-2  pm,  and  the  temperature 
of  the  internal  flame  zone  varied  within  1100  -  1200  K.  The  degree  of  decomposition  of  the  ini¬ 
tial  RDX  on  the  burning  surface  was  7  -  13  %.  The  increase  in  the  degree  of  RDX  decomposi¬ 
tion  in  the  condensed  phase  with  rise  in  pressure  is  due  to  the  increase  in  the  liquid-phase  reac¬ 
tion  rate  with  increase  in  the  surface  temperature,  which  obeys  the  law  of  equilibrium  vaporiza¬ 
tion  (Clausius— Clapeyron  equation).  The  effect  of  temperature  is  stronger  than  that  of  a  reduc¬ 
tion  of  residence  time. 

A  similar  chemical-reaction  scheme  was  used  by  the  same  authors  to  describe  the  HMX  combus¬ 
tion  wave  [110].  The  calculation  results  are  strikingly  similar:  at  p  =  20  -  40  atm,  the  zone  of 
HMX-vapor  decomposition  is  4  -  2  pm,  and  the  temperature  in  the  internal  flame  zone  rises  to 
approximately  1 100  K.  The  mass  fraction  of  HMX  vapor  near  the  burning  surface  is  30  %.  Pro¬ 
ceeding  from  the  assumption  of  a  two-zone  structure  of  the  HMX  flame  [110,  90],  Cohen  et  al. 
[Ill]  proposed  a  more  detailed  scheme  of  global  chemical  reactions.  It  includes  three  liquid- 
phase  decomposition  reactions  of  the  substance  and  five  or  six  gas-phase  reactions,  depending  on 
the  selected  reaction  path,  for  example,  through  formation  of  CH20  or  HCN.  The  alternative 
choice  of  a  path  is  a  result  of  insufficient  knowledge  of  the  true  mechanism.  Nevertheless,  the 
results  of  calculation  of  the  combustion-wave  parameters  were  close.  When  the  pressure  changes 
from  20  to  100  atm,  the  amount  of  HMX  that  reacts  in  the  condensed  phase  varies  from  2  to  8  %, 
which  indicates  the  dominant  effect  of  exothermal  vapor-phase  transformations,  even  at  p  =  100 
atm.  The  calculated  temperature  profile  has  a  clearly  expressed  two-stage  nature  with  an  almost 
zero  gradient  in  the  interval  between  the  primary  (vapor  decomposition)  and  secondary  (reaction 
between  vapor-decomposition  products)  flames.  The  width  of  the  primary-flame  zone  is  reduced 
by  approximately  a  factor  of  2  or  3  when  the  pressure  is  increased  from  20  to  100  atm;  the  tem¬ 
perature  of  this  zone  is  1030  -  1080  K.  The  calculation  data  led  to  the  important  conclusion  that 
it  is  practically  impossible  to  increase  the  burning  rates  for  HMX  by  means  of  catalysts.  This 


2—38 


goal  can  be  accomplished  by  acting  on  the  chemical  mechanism  of  the  process  to  increase  the 
heat  release  near  the  surface. 

Note  that  a  “plateau”  on  the  temperature  profile  was  not  observed  in  later  experimental  studies 
[70,  71].  The  conclusions  of  [110,  111]  that  condensed-phase  chemical  transformation  of  nitra- 
mines  are  insignificant  are  based  exclusively  on  theoretical  estimates  of  an  a  priori  character, 
since  it  is  very  difficult  to  measure  that  quantity  experimentally.  Nevertheless,  an  indirect  esti¬ 
mate  can  be  made  by  a  temperature-profile  analysis,  which  indicates  an  appreciable  contribution 
of  exothermic  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  to  the  heat  balance  on  the  burning  surface  [70, 
76,  78].  Of  interest  in  this  connection  are  the  results  of  modeling  in  [78],  based  on  an  examina¬ 
tion  of  intense  reactions  in  a  liquid  surface  layer  as  well  as  in  vapors  of  vaporized  substance  near 
the  burning  surface.  As  an  indirect  basis  for  their  approach,  Mitani  and  Williams  [78]  note  that 
the  power  law  of  the  burning  rate  versus  pressure  does  not  undergo  appreciable  changes  at  nearly 
atmospheric  pressures  and  in  the  range  of  70  -  100  atm,  but  the  experimental  data  indicate 
flameless  combustion  at  p  =  1  atm  and  a  change  in  flame  color  from  blue  to  bright  orange  with 
passage  through  the  pressure  level  of  70-100  atm. 

Analytical  solutions  and  estimates  made  on  their  basis  [78]  attest  to  a  gradual  increase  with  pres¬ 
sure  of  the  relative  contribution  of  the  heat  flux  from  the  gas  flame  qs  to  the  heat  balance  on  the 
burning  surface  (the  mass  fraction  of  vaporized  material  r\  increases  from  0.65  to  0.75  with  an 
increase  in  pressure  from  1  to  100  atm): 

qs  +  puQ(l  -  r|)  -  puLq  =  cpu(Ts  -  T0).  (2.16) 

A  combination  of  independently  determined  kinetic  parameters  with  selected  values  of  the  order 
and  pre-exponent  for  the  gas-phase  reaction,  yields  fairly  good  agreement  of  the  calculated  and 
experimental  data  on  the  dependencies  of  the  burning  rate  on  pressure  and  initial  temperature.  It 
was  found  that  at  the  lower  limit  of  combustion  with  respect  to  pressure  (~  0.2  atm),  the  heat  flux 
from  the  gas  phase  is  close  to  zero.  According  to  the  combustion  theory  [78],  this  must  lead  to 
diffusion  thermal  instability,  which  is  actually  observed  in  experiments. 

The  fairly  deep  transformation  of  the  condensed-phase  (tens  of  percent)  predicted  by  a  number 
of  models  makes  it  necessary  to  seek  methods  for  the  adequate  description  of  this  process.  The 
first  such  description  was  presented  in  [112],  which  dealt  with  the  combustion  of  polyvinyl  ni¬ 
trate.  It  was  hypothesized  that  the  gases  formed  in  the  liquid  layer  moved  simultaneously  with 
the  burning  surface.  In  this  case,  the  density  of  the  material  in  the  combustion  wave  decreases 
monotonically  to  the  gas  density.  Another  limiting  case  was  considered  in  [113],  where  it  was 
actually  hypothesized  that  gas  jets  emerged  at  increased  velocity  from  the  depth  of  the  liquid 
layer.  The  approach  of  [113]  was  studied  in  detail  in  [114,  115]  as  applied  to  nitramines.  The 
law  of  conservation  of  mass  is  written  as 

(pu)c(l  -  a)  +  (pu)g  a  =  dm/dt  =  const  (2.17) 

where  a  is  the  volume  fraction  of  gas  in  a  given  combustion-wave  cross  section.  It  was  proposed 
that  uc  ^  ug  be  calculated  using  an  additional  parameter  s,  which  characterizes  the  relative  effect 
of  the  surface-tension  forces  (Marangoni  effect)  and  liquid  viscosity.  Then, 
uc  =  [(dm/dt)/pc](l  -  sa),  ug  =  [(dm/dt)/pg](l  -  sa  +  s). 

Unfortunately,  the  lack  of  reliable  experimental  data  on  the  surface-tension  coefficient  does  not 
permit  one  to  estimate  s  reliably.  In  [115],  for  example,  calculations  were  performed  for  s  =  0.

As  noted  above,  models  with  an  extended  global  mechanism  have  made  it  possible  to  explain 
rather  successfully  the  observed  dependencies  of  the  burning  rate  on  pressure  and  initial  tem¬ 
perature,  but  they  are  incapable  of  explaining  the  actual  behavior  of  the  gas-component  concen¬ 
trations  in  a  flame.  This  problem  can  be  solved  only  on  the  basis  of  a  detailed  chemical  mecha¬ 
nism  of  reactions  in  a  flame,  that  includes  a  large  set  of  elementary  steps.  In  one  of  the  first 
studies  in  this  area,  devoted  to  RDX  combustion  [116],  the  experimental  data  of  [87]  were  used 
to  formulate  a  multistage  kinetic  mechanism  that  included  23  components  and  90  reversible  ele¬ 
mentary  steps.  The  problem  was  solved  for  the  secondary  flame  zone  under  the  assumption  that 
the  primary  zone  (vapor-decomposition  zone)  generates  NO  and  HCN  rather  than  NO2  and 
CH2O,  as  was  assumed  by  a  number  of  authors.  Calculations  made  it  possible  to  distinguish  the 
leading  (in  the  sense  of  component  production)  steps  of  the  process  and  to  refine  the  rate  con¬ 
stants  of  little-studied  reactions.  As  a  result,  fairly  good  agreement  with  measured  [87]  compo¬ 
nent-concentration  profiles  was  obtained  in  [116-118],  but  the  absence  of  experimental  data  on 
the  temperature  profile  did  not  permit  additional  estimate  of  the  rate  constants  to  be  obtained.  An 
attempt  was  undertaken  to  model  the  chemical  processes  over  the  entire  flame  zone  using  a  de¬ 
tailed  kinetic  mechanism  supplemented  by  a  single-stage  reaction  of  RDX-vapor  decomposition. 
Along  with  other  components,  the  molar  fraction  of  vapor  on  the  burning  surface  was  varied  in 
the  calculations.  When  the  law  of  conservation  of  energy  for  the  condensed  and  gas  phases  was 
satisfied,  the  mass  flow  rate  of  vapor  was  overestimated  in  the  calculations,  and  this  could  be  a 
consequence  of  the  adopted  values  of  the  rate  constants  for  the  little-studied  steps.  Nevertheless, 
as  numerous  subsequent  calculations  have  shown,  the  assumptions  of  a  monotonic  rise  of  tem¬ 
perature  (single-zone  structure),  the  leading  role  of  the  interaction  of  HCN  and  NO,  and  the 
multi-step  nature  of  RDX-vapor  decomposition  were  valid. 

After  [116-118],  similar  studies  were  published  abroad.  HMX  combustion  was  modeled  in  [119] 
on  the  basis  of  a  kinetic  mechanism  containing  26  components  and  77  reversible  elementary  re¬ 
actions.  The  effect  of  the  composition  of  the  condensed-phase  decomposition  products  on  the 
burning  rate  was  examined  by  calculations.  When  the  single  decomposition  pathway 

HMX  -»  4  H  +  HCN  +  N02  (2.18) 

was  selected,  the  calculated  burning  rate  was  lower  than  the  experimental.  It  is  emphasized  that 
HCN  and  NO  are  the  main  reacting  components  in  this  case  and  the  source  of  NO  is  the  reaction 

H  +  N02  — >  NO  +  OH. 

Attempts  to  describe  the  decomposition  process  strictly  through  the  reaction 

HMX  ->  4  (CH20  +  N20)  (2.19) 

led  to  a  divergence  in  the  computation  process.  When  the  decomposition  channels  were  com¬ 
bined  and  the  fraction  of  decomposition  through  channel  (2.19)  was  increased,  the  calculated 
burning  rate  rose  greatly.  Therefore,  both  decomposition  branches  were  combined  to  obtain  the 
required  burning  rate.  In  [51,  120],  an  attempt  was  made  to  combine  a  detailed  description  of  the 
chemical  reactions  in  a  RDX  flame  with  a  global  description  of  condensed-phase  reactions.  The 
total  mechanism  [51]  included  a  detailed  kinetic  scheme  of  RDX-vapor  decomposition  and  com¬ 
prised  38  components  and  158  stages.  RDX  decomposition  in  the  liquid  phase  was  modeled  by 
the  first-order  reaction  RDX  — »  3  CH2O  +3  N2O  with  rate  constant  K  =  4.66- 1018  exp(- 
47800/RT)  [sec'1].  According  to  calculations  performed  for  p  =  0.5,  1,  17,  and  20  atm,  about  93 
%  of  the  RDX  is  vaporized  from  the  burning  surface,  and  the  burning  rate  is  chiefly  governed  by 
the  heat  feed  from  the  flame.  At  p  =  0.5  atm,  the  calculated  concentration  profiles  are  in  satisfac¬ 
tory  agreement  with  experiment  [87].

The  approach  of  [51,  120]  was  further  developed  by  American  researchers.  For  example,  a  sub¬ 
stantially  detailed  description  of  liquid-phase  processes  can  be  found  in  [121].  The  formation  of 
bubbles  in  the  liquid  phase  and  the  reaction  in  them  of  18  gaseous  components  were  taken  into 
account.  In  the  liquid  phase,  reactions  between  five  liquid  components  and  seven  gaseous  com¬ 
ponents  dissolved  in  the  liquid  components  were  allowed  for.  The  refined  kinetic  mechanism 
from  [51]  was  used  in  the  gas  phase.  The  problem  of  unsteady  RDX  combustion  formulated  in 
[121]  requires  knowledge  of  numerous  constants  that  are  presently  unavailable.  Examples  of 
calculations  of  combustion-wave  parameters  are  not  presented  in  [121].  A  description  of  proc¬ 
esses  in  a  foamed  liquid  layer  that  was  simpler  and  more  realizable  in  practical  calculations  was 
proposed  in  [122].  The  calculations  employed  two  detailed  chemical  flame  mechanisms:  ac¬ 
cording  to  [51]  and  [123].  The  temperature  distribution  and  the  concentration  profiles  of  the  main 
components  were  well  reproduced.  In  combustion  under  normal  conditions  (p  =  1  atm  and  To  = 
20  °C),  the  degree  of  condensed-phase  decomposition  on  the  surface  is  50  %,  and  the  volume 
fraction  of  the  gas  phase  reaches  40  %.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  in  a  combustion  wave  at  p  = 
90  atm  the  parameter  values  are  similar  (degree  of  decomposition  50  %  and  volumetric  frac¬ 
tion  of  bubbles  35  %).  However,  the  thickness  of  the  chemical-reaction  zone  in  the  condensed 
phase  is  reduced  approximately  from  90  p,  to  1.5  pm  in  this  case.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that 
condensed-phase  transformations  are  described  in  the  model  by  an  integrated  method  -  by  both 
the  chemical  reaction  of  the  starting  liquid  RDX  and  the  reaction  of  the  products  of  RDX-vapor 
decomposition  in  the  bubbles.  The  equation  of  conservation  of  mass  (2.17)  is  solved  in  [122]  as¬ 
suming  that  (up)g  =  (up)c.  In  fact,  this  means  that  the  gases  escape  from  the  burning  surface  in  a 
jet  mode  (the  scheme  described  in  [113]),  and  it  is  difficult  to  expect  that  a  foam  layer  will  be 
formed  on  the  surface.  Consequently,  the  residence  time  of  the  gaseous  components  in  the  liquid 
layer  must  be  extremely  short,  at  least  at  low  pressures.  Therefore,  an  integrated  description  of 
heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase  with  allowance  for  gas-phase  reactions  in  bubbles  and  jets  is 
unjustified. 

Formulations  of  the  problem  similar  to  [122]  have  been  carefully  analyzed  in  [100,  124]  from  the 
point  of  view  of  the  selection  of  input  data  for  model  calculations  and  to  explain  the  observed 
temperature  profile.  It  was  found  that  the  weak  points  in  the  full-scale  modeling  of  combustion 
waves  were  in  the  description  of  the  condensed-phase  decomposition  processes  and  the  liquid- 
to-gas  transition.  All  researchers  have  to  use  a  simplified  global  description  of  the  condensed- 
phase  reactions  that  includes  two  or  three  parallel  stages.  The  choice  of  kinetic  parameters  for 
these  reactions  is  rather  arbitrary.  The  vaporization  process  is  described  approximately,  often 
using  kinetic  constants  that  correspond  to  sublimation  experiments.  Nevertheless,  with  a  proper 
selection  of  input  data,  calculations  permit  mainly  successful  matching  with  available  experi¬ 
mental  results  for  the  burning  rates  of  RDX  and  HMX,  their  temperature  sensitivities,  and  the 
temperature  and  concentration  profiles.  Some  questions  remain  concerning  the  concentration  pro¬ 
files  of  NO2  and  NO,  which  could  be  a  result  of  experimental  errors  or  incorrect  specification  of 
the  input  parameters  for  the  calculation.  Moreover,  the  detailed  kinetics  of  nitramine-vapor  de¬ 
composition  remains  little  studied  both  theoretically  and  experimentally. 

In  [51,  122,  124],  the  mass  burning  rate  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  mass  fluxes  of 
molecules  that  have  left  and  returned  to  the  liquid.  The  ratio  of  the  mass  burning  rate  to  the 
fluxes  is  small  (~  0.001  -  0.0001  [125]),  and  this  can  lead  to  instability  of  the  computation  proc¬ 
ess.  In  addition,  the  coefficient  of  accommodation  (sticking)  of  liquid  molecules  is  usually  un- 


2 — 41 


known,  and  in  most  calculations  it  is  assumed  a  priori  to  be  equal  to  unity.  To  avoid  this,  it  was 
proposed  [125]  that  the  law  of  equilibrium  vaporization  be  used  as  a  condition  at  the  liquid-gas 
interface  (as  in  [89])  and  the  burning  rate  be  determined  as  an  eigenvalue  of  a  boundary-value 
problem. 

In  modeling  the  RDX  combustion  wave,  Prasad  et  al.  described  [125]  the  process  of  liquid-phase 
decomposition  by  the  stages 

RDX  -4  3  CH20  +  3  N20, 

RDX  ->  3  H2CN  +  3  N02, 

CH20  +  N02  — >  CO  +  NO  +  H20 

This  implies  that  the  gases  are  dissolved  in  the  liquid  and  leave  it  by  diffusion  and  that  a  foam 
layer  does  not  exist.  Flame  reactions  are  described  by  a  chemical  mechanism  based  on  228  ele¬ 
mentary  stages  and  44  reagents.  The  basis  of  the  mechanism  was  borrowed  from  [51],  and  addi¬ 
tions  were  taken  from  [126,  127].  The  calculations  gave  an  exponent  of  the  burning-rate  law 
equal  to  0.76,  which  correlates  with  the  experimental  dependence  fairly  well.  Satisfactory  agree¬ 
ment  was  also  obtained  with  the  experimentally  measured  temperature  profile  and  burning  rate 
temperature  sensitivity.  It  is  pointed  out  that  the  process  of  RDX  melting  in  fact  occurs  not  sud¬ 
denly  at  a  given  temperature  but  is  “spread”  over  a  certain  temperature  interval.  It  is  also  noted 
that  the  use  of  classical  concepts  of  vaporization  and  condensation  of  molecules  under  strong 
temperature  gradients  in  the  liquid,  which  correspond  to  combustion  in  the  presence  of  a  power¬ 
ful  external  heat  supply,  can  lead  to  substantial  errors. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  overwhelming  majority  of  efforts  to  model  the  combustion  of  energetic 
materials  and  nitramines,  in  particular,  have  been  devoted  to  the  description  of  steady  processes. 
This  is  due  to  the  great  difficulties  in  the  numerical  realization  of  such  problems  (analytic  ap¬ 
proaches  do  not  work  because  of  the  strong  nonlinearity  of  the  equations)  and  the  absence  of 
physical  concepts  of  the  dynamic  behavior  of  the  reacting  system.  As  applied  to  nitramines, 
Zarko  et  al.  [128,  129]  formulated  the  problem  of  the  unsteady  combustion  of  melted  energetic 
material  with  an  exothermic  transformation  in  the  liquid  phase  (one  global  reaction  of  the  first 
order)  and  the  gas  phase  (a  global  reaction  of  the  first  order  for  vapor  decomposition  and  a  global 
reaction  of  the  second  order  for  the  interaction  of  the  decomposition  products).  A  boundary  con¬ 
dition  at  the  interface  was  formulated  in  the  form  of  the  Clausius— Clapeyron  equilibrium  va¬ 
porization  law.  Despite  the  simplified  formulation,  the  model  allowed  a  number  of  important  ob¬ 
servations  to  be  explained.  It  was  shown  that,  depending  on  the  choice  of  kinetic  parameters,  ig¬ 
nition  can  occur  as  a  result  of  heat  release  in  the  condensed  or  gas  phase.  However,  when  intense 
pulsed  heating  of  the  gas  near  the  surface  is  simulated  (by  means  of  a  wire  or  electric  spark),  a 
flame  can  be  ignited  at  a  short  distance  from  the  burning  surface.  This  theoretical  prediction  was 
verified  at  the  Institute  of  Chemical  Kinetics  and  Combustion  in  laboratory  experiments  at  at¬ 
mospheric  pressure.  Ignition  of  pressed  RDX  by  an  ND/YAG  laser  led  to  flameless  gasification 
of  the  specimen,  which  became  flame  combustion  when  a  local  flame  from  a  gas  burner  was  in¬ 
troduced  into  the  stream  of  decomposition  products. 

Intrinsic  instability  of  combustion  with  vaporization  on  the  surface  in  the  presence  of  appreciable 
heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase  and  with  comparatively  weak  heat  release  from  the  gas  was 
revealed  by  calculations  [130].  The  instability  is  caused  by  the  formation  of  a  temperature 


2—42 


maximum  in  the  liquid  layer  due  to  the  heat  sink  on  the  surface  as  a  result  of  endothermal  vapori¬ 
zation  process. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  unsteady  combustion  mechanism  is  sensitive  to  energy  stimulus 
with  comparatively  small  contributions.  In  particular,  this  pertains  to  the  melting  heat,  which  is 
less  than  3  -  4  %  of  the  total  heat  effect  of  combustion.  It  was  established  [131]  that  allowance 
for  melting  narrows  the  stability  region  of  steady  combustion  for  semi-transparent  materials.  For 
opaque  energetic  materials,  there  is  a  region  of  stable  combustion  under  radiation,  which  is 
bounded  by  upper  and  lower  critical  values  of  radiant  flux.  The  greater  the  melting  heat,  the 
wider  the  region  of  stable  combustion  under  radiation. 

Erikson  and  Beckstead  [132]  undertook  an  attempt  to  construct  a  numerical  model  of  unsteady 
RDX  combustion  within  the  framework  of  a  detailed  chemical  mechanism  that  included  two 
global  chemical  stages  in  the  condensed  phase  and  120  elementary  steps  (43  components)  in  the 
gas  phase.  The  behavior  of  the  RDX  burning  rate  under  periodic  action  of  laser  radiation  was 
modeled.  Satisfactory  quantitative  agreement  with  experimentally  measured  [133]  amplitudes  of 
the  burning-rate  response  was  achieved,  and  the  behavior  of  the  phase  shift  of  the  burning  rate 
was  reproduced  qualitatively.  It  must  be  noted,  however,  that  along  with  a  comparatively  de¬ 
tailed  description  of  the  chemical  mechanism,  Erikson  and  Beckstead  [132]  used  a  very  approxi¬ 
mate  relation  between  the  instantaneous  burning  rate  and  the  surface  temperature  Ts  in  the  form 
of  the  pyrolysis  law  u  =  const  exp(-Ev/R  Ts),  where  Ev  is  the  activation  energy  of  vaporization. 
Neither  the  structure  of  this  relation  nor  the  choice  of  an  activation-energy  value  is  justified,  and 
this  casts  doubt  on  the  reliability  of  information  obtained  in  such  calculations. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  when  global  kinetics  was  used,  calculations  [129]  showed  the  possi¬ 
bility  of  obtaining  qualitatively  different  forms  of  the  burning-rate  response  function  for  the  peri¬ 
odic  action  of  laser  radiation.  One  of  these  forms,  which  coincides  with  the  classical  form  [133, 
134],  is  obtained  under  conditions  of  flameless  gasification,  which  approximately  corresponds  to 
the  specification  of  a  pyrolysis  law  for  the  burning  rate.  Another,  which  is  distinguished  by  the 
asymptotic  convergence  of  the  response  function  on  a  finite  value  (instead  of  zero  level,  as  in  the 
classical  case),  occurs  when  the  rate  controlling  zone  is  located  in  the  gas  phase. 

It  is  obvious  that  a  great  deal  of  efforts  must  be  applied  to  construct  an  adequate  description  of 
unsteady  combustion  even  for  comparatively  simple  monopropellants  such  as  nitramines.  One 
aspect  of  this  work  involves  the  construction  of  reduced  global  schemes  that  follow  from  detailed 
chemical  mechanisms.  Successful  examples  of  such  schemes  are  known  (see,  e.g.,  [135])  but  for 
nitramine  flames  they  are  not  available. 

Reduction  of  a  detailed  chemical  mechanism  is  aimed  primarily  at  reducing  the  volume  of  com¬ 
putations.  At  the  same  time,  selection  of  rate  controlling  stages,  which  is  an  important  aspect  of 
this  work,  facilitates  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  chemistry  of  the  combustion  process. 
According  to  the  aforesaid,  a  two-stage  chemical  process  occurs  in  the  gas  phase  of  a  nitramine 
combustion  wave.  The  complexity  of  the  chemical  process  and  the  lack  of  many  kinetic  pa¬ 
rameters  cause  complicates  the  theoretical  description  of  the  process.  In  particular,  the  above- 
mentioned  detailed  kinetic  mechanisms  differ  considerably  in  the  number  of  steps  as  well  as  in 
the  rate  constants  of  the  elementary  steps.  In  experiments,  along  with  stable  components,  optical 


2 — 43 


methods  yield  a  distribution  of  active  species  (atoms  and  radicals)  [71,  81],  and,  therefore,  allow¬ 
ance  for  steps  in  which  these  species  participate  is  important  in  identification  of  the  kinetic 
mechanism.  However,  the  energy  contributions  of  species  with  small  molar  fractions  are  small, 
the  roles  of  active  species  in  the  chemical  process  differ,  and  some  of  them  can  often  be  ignored 
in  calculations  in  technical  applications.  For  processes  in  RDX  flames,  the  rate  controlling  stages 
were  studied  in  [116-118]  (23  components  and  90  steps)  in  the  luminous  zone  of  the  flame, 
while  in  [51]  (38  components  and  158  steps)  and  [123]  (44  components  and  228  steps)  they  were 
studied  in  the  entire  flame  zone.  Series  of  calculations  of  the  chemical  structure  of  the  RDX 
flame  we  performed  to  find  the  rate  controlling  steps  and  components.  The  calculations  were  per¬ 
formed  [136]  for  p  =  0.5  -  90  atm.  As  input  data  for  the  calculations,  experimental  values  were 
specified  of  the  burning  rate  and  burning-surface  temperature  as  well  as  initial  molar  fractions  of 
components  typical  of  RDX  combustion  under  self-deflagration  conditions  and  under  the  influ¬ 
ence  of  laser  radiation.  The  kinetic  mechanism  included  reactions  from  the  mechanisms  of  [51, 
125]  and  contained  265  steps  and  43  components.  The  selection  was  performed  using  various  sets 
of  elementary-reaction  rate  constants.  Preliminarily,  kinetic  mechanisms  were  obtained  consisting 
of  80-100  stages  and  31-35  components  (C2N2,  HCNO,  CNO,  H2CNO,  H2CNH,  H2O2,  NO3, 
HN03,  NCN,  H02,  HOCN,  and  NH3  were  excluded). 

Concluding  remarks 

As  already  noted,  the  problem  of  constructing  an  adequate  physicochemical  mechanism  of  nitra- 
mine  combustion  has  been  stated,  among  others.  It  is  apparent  from  the  above  material  that  the 
concept  of  “adequacy”  itself  has  evolved  over  time.  In  particular,  use  of  extended  schemes  of 
global  reactions  instead  of  schemes  with  a  single  global  reaction  has  greatly  increased  the  “flexi¬ 
bility”  of  mathematical  description,  which  has  considerably  improved  the  agreement  with  ex¬ 
periment.  However,  the  selection  of  kinetic  parameters  for  any  global  chemical  stage  contained 
in  the  complex  mechanism  of  transformations  in  the  combustion  wave  cannot  be  based  on  a  pri¬ 
ori  assumptions.  This  is  a  fundamental  difficulty  in  formulation  of  global  chemical  mechanisms. 

So  far,  experiments  have  played  a  decisive  role  in  the  understanding  of  the  nitramine-combustion 
mechanism.  Recent  studies  have  provided  important  information  on  the  structure  of  the  combus¬ 
tion  wave.  It  has  been  found  that  the  temperature  distribution  in  a  self-sustained  combustion 
wave  has  a  single-zone  structure,  but  the  chemical  stages  of  vapor  decomposition  and  the  forma¬ 
tion  of  final  combustion  products  are  separated  in  space.  Under  the  influence  of  a  powerful  radi¬ 
ant  flux,  the  temperature  distribution  also  becomes  two-zone,  the  zones  are  broadened,  and  this 
provides  new  fundamental  possibilities  for  studying  the  combustion  mechanism,  since  the  com¬ 
position  of  the  gasification  products,  which  under  these  conditions  is  more  easily  determined,  car¬ 
ries  information  on  the  chemical  transformations  in  the  condensed  phase.  The  need  to  develop 
new  experimental  approaches  to  studying  the  structure  and  dynamic  behavior  of  the  combustion 
wave  retains  its  importance.  In  particular,  it  remains  unknown  how  a  two-phase  medium  is 
formed  in  a  liquid  layer,  how  gas  is  liberated  from  a  condensed  substance,  and  what  conditions 
characterize  processes  on  a  burning  surface. 

Theoretical  description  of  nitramine  combustion  has  gained  considerable  development  in  the  past 
decade.  However,  it  can  be  said  that  it  still  depends  to  a  considerable  extent  on  the  intuition  and 
individual  “skill  ”  of  the  researcher.  Impressive  advances  have  been  made  in  the  description  of 
nitramine  flames.  It  has  become  clear  that  the  lack  of  reliable  information  on  the  concentration 


2—44 


profiles  in  real  flames  is  limiting  at  the  present  time,  but  theoretical  calculations  make  it  fairly 
easy  to  explain  new  experimental  data.  At  the  same  time,  the  description  of  condensed-phase 
processes  has  been  implemented  at  a  very  approximate  level,  and,  as  has  been  emphasized  above, 
the  choice  of  global  reactions  and  kinetic  parameters  does  not  have  a  reliable  basis. 

Studies  of  the  unsteady  combustion  of  nitramines  are  of  significance  as  a  source  of  important  ad¬ 
ditional  information  on  the  combustion  mechanism.  On  the  one  hand,  the  problem  is  one  of  ob¬ 
taining  reliable  experimental  information  on  the  unsteady  burning  rate  and  on  the  behavior  of  the 
temperature  and  concentration  profiles.  On  the  other  hand,  considerable  efforts  are  required  to 
construct  adequate  mathematical  models  and  methods  for  their  solution.  It  is  obvious  that  un¬ 
steady  processes  contain  an  enormous  volume  of  information,  which  cannot  be  obtained  and 
processed  over  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  Both  approaches  must  therefore  be  combined  to  in¬ 
crease  the  effectiveness  of  research.

2.3.  COMBUSTION  OF  GAP 


Glyzidyl  Azide  Polymer  (GAP)  is  one  of  the  most  perspective  candidates  for  the  next  generation 
of  fuel-binders  for  high  energy  composite  propellants.  Its  advantages  are  relatively  high  density, 
high  burning  rate,  and  high  energy  release  in  thermal  decomposition. 

Chemical  formula  of  the  GAP  prepolymer  is  C3H5ON3.  It  is  seen  that  GAP  is  deficient  in  the 
oxygen  needed  for  complete  combustion.  The  energetics  of  the  GAP  combustion  is  provided  by 
the  scission  of  N-N2  bond,  which  produces  gaseous  N2.  The  thermo-physical  and  kinetic  proper¬ 
ties  of  the  GAP  polymer  can  depend  on  degree  and  method  of  curing  and  cross-linking.  Usually, 
the  cured  GAP,  below  we  call  it  as  GAP  propellant  [1,2],  consist  of  81-85%  of  the  GAP  mono¬ 
mer,  16-12%  of  curing  agent  (isophorone  diisocyanate,  IPDI,  or  hexamethylene  diisocyanate, 
HMDI),  and  3%  of  curing  agent  (trimethylopropane,  TMP).  There  can  be  also  used  catalyst  for 
the  curing  reaction,  e.g.,  di-n-butylin  dilaurate  (DBTDL).  The  molecular  mass  of  the  GAP  pre¬ 
polymer  is  1980  g/mol  [1],  density  is  1.3  g/cm3  and  heat  of  formation  AHf  =  229cal/g  [1],  or  280 
cal/g  [3].  The  calculations  of  combustion  products  of  the  GAP  prepolymer  by  equilibrium  code 
give  at  pressure  50  atm  the  following  mole  fractions  of  components  [1]: 

N2  CO  C02  CH4  H2  H20  C  (solid) 

22.34  13.95  0.13  2.15  32.19  0.71  28.47 

If  the  same  calculations  are  made  with  preventing  the  formation  of  solid  carbon,  the  mole  fraction 
of  H2  decreases  by  about  1%  while  content  of  N2,  CO,  and  CH4  increases  by  12%  each.  Small 
amounts  (ca.  2-3%)  of  naphthelene,  benzene,  and  HCN  may  exist  in  the  combustion  products  in 
the  last  case. 

An  existence  of  a  carbon  residue  on  the  burning  surface  of  GAP  was  reported  in  [1,2,4, 5].  How¬ 
ever,  there  are  some  doubts  in  formation  of  solid  carbon  in  combustion  wave  of  GAP  (see  [6,7]). 
In  fact,  relatively  strong  heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase  of  the  GAP  propellant  that  gives  rise 
in  the  burning  surface  temperature  up  to  700-800  K  and  provides  burning  rate  about  1  cm/s  at 
pressure  40  atm,  leads  to  relatively  high  speed  of  gaseous  decomposition  products  moving  from 
the  condensed  phase.  This  means  that  the  residence  time  for  these  products  in  the  gas  flame  is 
relatively  small  and  one  may  expect  great  difference  between  adiabatic  flame  temperature  (cal¬ 
culated  by  equilibrium  program)  and  experimentally  measured  one.  The  experimental  data  on  the 
temperature  profile  measurements  are  shown  in  Figs.  2.3  and  2.4.

Here  Ts  is  the  surface  temperature,  Tf  is  the  maximum  flame  temperature,  and  Td  is  the  decompo¬ 
sition  temperature  corresponding  to  the  beginning  of  decomposition  reactions  in  the  condensed 
phase.  It  is  seen  that  the  measured  value  of  Tf  is  far  from  thermodynamically  determined  (ca. 
1000  K  instead  of  ca.  1400  K  at  50  atm). 

2.3.1.  Experimental  observations. 

The  first  detailed  data  on  the  GAP  decomposition  and  combustion  has  been  reported  in  [1]. 
Thermochemical  analysis  with  use  of  DTA  and  TG  techniques  showed  that  when  heated  at  the 
rate  10  K/min  the  GAP  propellant,  cured  with  HMDI,  starts  to  decompose  exothermically  at 
about  475  K  and  finishes  at  537  K.  This  is  accompanied  with  42%  weight  loss.  In  the  second 
stage  of  decomposition  the  weigt-loss  continues  slowly  but  heat  does  not  liberate  (within  the  ex¬ 
perimental  method  accuracy).  These  data  were  confirmed  with  more  complicated  techniques  us¬ 
ing  differential  scanning  calorimeter  and  mass  spectrometer.  It  was  revealed  that  heat  release  in 
the  condensed  phase  actually  terminates  when  reaching  weight-loss  about  41%.  The  amount  of 
nitrogen  atoms,  evolved  from  the  GAP  propellant  at  this  moment,  equals  68%  and  the  rest  of  ni¬ 
trogen  is  released  during  the  second  stage  of  decomposition.  Analysis  of  infrared  spectra  of  the 
GAP  propellant  samples  recorded  before  and  after  thermal  degradation  by  41%  exhibited  the 
break  of  the  nitrogene  tripple  bond  (-N3).  At  the  same  time  the  presence  of  hydrogen  atoms  in 
decomposition  products  with  linearly  increasing  concentration  versus  decomposition  degree  gave 
background  for  assumption  that  molecular  structure  of  the  GAP  may  convert  under  heating  from 
-CH2-N=N2  into  -ON  with  simultaneous  release  of  (N2+H2).  Latest  studies  of  different  authors 
showed  that  most  probably  the  first  step  of  decomposition  consists  of  the  breaking  off  of  N2  from 
the  azide  to  form  the  nitrene  [8,9]: 

— ochch2  —  —  ochch2 — 

I  - >  I  +  n2 

CR^s  CH2N 

According  to  the  findings  of  Ref.  [9],  the  further  decomposition  of  nitrene  involves  two  decom¬ 
position  paths  preceding  with  migration  of  n-atom  inside  nitrene  molecule.  The  first  path  pro¬ 
duces  NCN,  CO  and  methane  while  the  second  path  leads  to  formation  of  ethylene,  acetylene  and 
CO.  Unfortunately,  there  is  still  no  reliable  evidences  of  predomination  of  any  particular  path  in 
the  GAP  decomposition. 


2—54 


Some  interesting  observations,  related  to  the  mechanism  of  decomposition  in  combustion  condi¬ 
tions,  were  made  via  examination  with  scanning  electrone  microscope  of  quenched  burning  sam¬ 
ples  of  the  GAP  propellant.  First  of  all,  on  the  top-view  of  cooled  by  liquid  nitrogen  the  GAP 
propellant  quenched  samples  a  number  of  holes  of  some  tens  of  micron  size  has  been  recognized. 
This  shows  that  subsurface  layer  is  softened  during  combustion  and  gases  release  through  it.  Mi¬ 
croscopic  examination  of  knife-edge  cuttings  showed  existence  of  cavities  in  subsurface  layer 
with  sizes  of  the  order  of  several  microns.  Just  below  the  bubble  generating  zone  the  surface  of 
cutted  sample  is  smooth  that  means  that  polymer  melts  at  the  temperature  close  to  the  burning 
surface  temperature. 

According  to  the  data  of  Ref.  [1],  the  pressure  exponent  of  the  GAP  propellant  in  the  pressure 
range  10-100  atm  equals  0.44  at  different  initial  temperatures.  The  burning  rate  temperature  sen¬ 
sitivity  ctp  =  (dlnrt/dTo)p  equals  0.01  K'1  in  this  pressure  range.  The  number  of  published  data  on 
the  burning  rate  behavior  is  very  limited.  It  has  been  reported  in  Ref.  [2]  that  the  burning  law  for 
the  GAP  propellant  at  pressures  below  23  atm  is  similar  to  that  reported  in  Ref.  [1].  At  higher 
pressures  the  pressure  exponent  noticeably  decreases.  In  addition  to  the  mentioned  values  of 
pressure  exponent  there  have  been  reported  values  of  0.28  [10],  0.63  [5],  0.69  [11].  It  was  also 
reported  rather  low  value  of  the  burning  rate  temperature  sensitivity  equal  to  0.002  K'1  [2],  which 
seems  to  be  dependent  on  the  type  of  the  curing  agent  used. 

2.3.2.  Burning  rate  simulation. 

The  first  attempt  to  correlate  the  burning  rate  with  measured  values  of  the  burning  surface  tem¬ 
perature  was  undertaken  in  Ref.  [1],  Assuming  an  Arrenius-type  decomposition  of  GAP  propel¬ 
lant  in  the  combustion  wave,  the  burning  rate  equation  was  presented  in  the  form: 

rb(m  /  s)  =  9,160  exp(-8.7  •  104  /  RTS ) 

Based  on  this  expression,  the  relationship  for  the  value  of  the  surface  temperature  sensitivity  was 
derived  as  follows: 


(K /dT0)p  =  ffpRTs2  /Es 

With  Es=20.8  Kcal/mol  and  experimental  values  of  Ts  and  ap,  the  magnitude  of  (dTs  / dT0)p  has 

been  determined  to  be  0.48  at  P=50  atm.  It  should  be  noted  that  reported  values  of  op  =  0.01  K'1 
and  (dTs  /dT0)p  correspond  to  the  domain  of  very  developed  unstable  combustion.  Indeed,  ac¬ 
cording  to  phenomenological  approach  [12]  the  limiting  value  of  (dTs/dT0)p  corresponding  to 

oscillating  combustion  boundary,  has  to  no  less  than  [ crp(Ts-To)-l ]  /[ <yp(Ts-To)+l ].  However,  with 
op=0.01K_1  and  (Ts-To)  >  350K  the  estimated  value  of  (BTs/dT0)p  exceeds  1.3  which  is  large 

0.48.  There  is  no  experimental  data  on  unstable  combustion  of  GAP  propellant  in  studied  range 
of  pressures. 

A  simplified  version  of  the  combustion  model  for  the  GAP  propellant  has  been  presented  in  Ref. 
[2].  It  was  assumed  that  the  N2  liberation  in  the  melt  layer  of  the  condensed  phase  may  play  rate 


2—55 


control  role.  Solution  for  steady-state  one-dimensional  combustion  wave  with  negligible  heat 
feedback  from  gas  flame  was  obtained  using  an  asymptotic  analysis: 

M  ~(TS  I  ) expC-fs,  / 2TS )  (2.21) 

Here  M  is  the  dimensionless  mass  burning  rate,  and  Ts,  Qi  and  Ei  are  the  dimensionless  surface 
temperature,  heat  of  reaction  in  the  melt  layer  and  energy  of  activation  for  this  reaction,  respec¬ 
tively.  The  relationship  obtained  is  very  similar  to  that  developed  for  the  rate  control  stage  in  the 
condensed  phase  [13].  The  dependence  of  mass  burning  rate  on  the  surface  temperature  is  the 
most  pronounced  due  to  exponential  term.  However,  the  method  for  calculation  of  Ts  is  not  re¬ 
ported  in  [2],  thus  its  value  should  be  determined  experimentally.  Knowing  the  values  of  Ts  al¬ 
lows  to  obtain  estimate  for  Ei. 

Actually,  relationship  (2.21)  gives  very  limited  possibilities  for  describing  the  GAP  combustion 
law,  especially  in  term  of  its  pressure  and  temperature  sensitivities.  This  is  because  of  simplified 
representation  of  the  processes  in  the  condensed  phase  and  practical  neglecting  the  processes  in 
the  gas  phase.  More  advanced  approach  in  the  modeling  of  the  GAP  combustion  behavior  has 
been  developed  in  [6]. 

In  accordance  with  this  last  approach  the  combustion  wave  is  divided  into  3  regions:  1)  the  solid 
non-reacting  material,  2)  the  two-phase  decomposition  zone,  3)  the  gas  flame.  The  details  of  the 
mathematical  formulation  of  the  problem  have  been  described  by  authors  earlier  [14].  Briefly, 
region  1  is  described  by  the  energy  equation  without  any  source  terms.  Region  2  involves  inte¬ 
gration  of  the  energy  and  species  equations  in  x  coordinate  until  all  condensed  material  has  dis¬ 
appeared.  The  results  of  integration  (temperature  and  species  mass  fluxes)  are  used  as  boundary 
conditions  for  region  3.  Region  3  involves  integration  of  energy  and  species  equations  in  the  gas 
phase.  The  burning  rate  is  determined  from  the  condition  of  heat  balance  at  the  interface  between 
region  2  and  region  3. 

The  peculiarities  of  the  GAP  combustion  modeling  result  from  uncertainties  in  phase  transitions 
with  polymer.  Instead  of  true  melting,  as  in  the  case  of  crystalline  materials,  the  polymer  GAP 
has  no  distinctive  melting  point.  Thus,  the  choice  of  boundary  of  region  2  is  somewhat  arbitrary. 
It  corresponds  some  temperature  value  “below  a  temperature  where  decomposition  is  occurring  at 
any  significant  rate”.  Again,  in  the  contrary  with  a  case  of  crystalline  materials,  it  is  assumed  that 
the  evaporation  plays  insignificant  role.  Therefore,  the  burning  surface  is  defined  as  the  point  cor¬ 
responding  to  99.999%  conversion  of  the  condensed  phase  material  into  gaseous  species. 

The  reaction  scheme  for  the  region  2  was  constructed  on  the  basis  of  the  very  restricted  data  on 
the  species  detected  by  mass  spectrometry  in  decomposition  studies.  Three  different  global 
mechanisms,  involving  each  4  steps,  were  proposed.  As  mentioned  earlier  in  this  section,  the  first 
step  in  every  mechanism  consists  of  liberation  of  N2.  For  simplicity,  80%  of  N2  is  liberated  during 
the  first  step,  the  rest  of  N2  is  liberated  in  subsequent  steps.  The  difference  between  mechanisms 
is  that  they  vary  formation  of  some  key  components  like  H2CN,  CN,  H2O,  CH2,  CNO,  C2H3  and 
C  (solid).  Products  of  the  condensed  phase  decomposition  react  later  in  the  gas  phase.  A  mecha¬ 
nism  of  the  gas  phase  reactions  is  composed  of  several  mechanisms  used  in  the  literature  for 


2—56 


RDX,  AP  and  hydrocarbon  gas  combustion.  Resulting  reaction  scheme  contains  58  species  and 
involves  292  reactions.  No  reduction  of  that  mechanism  was  performed. 

The  calculations  were  conducted  in  several  successive  steps.  First,  adjusting  the  species  produced 
and  kinetic  constants  was  made  in  order  to  set  the  value  of  burning  rate  to  the  experimental  value 
at  fixed  pressure,  and  to  match  the  heat  fluxes  at  the  interface  between  regions  2  and  3.  The  series 
of  calculations  were  performed  in  order  to  compare  the  theoretical  results  with  experimental  data 
at  different  initial  temperatures  and  pressures.  It  was  found  that  the  mechanisms  proposed  repro¬ 
duce  fairly  well  the  experimental  burning  law  for  the  GAP  propellant  in  the  range  of  10-70  atm. 
Adiabatic  flame  temperature  was  compared  with  thermal-equilibrium  temperature  computed  by 
thermodynamic  code.  As  is  shown  in  Fig.2.5,  mechanisms  A  and  B  exhibit  rather  good  agree¬ 
ment  at  pressures  higher  than  20  atm  but  mechanism  C  gives  much  lower  constant  flame  tem¬ 
perature.  The  burning  rate  temperature  sensitivity,  measured  in  Ref.  [1],  is  well  reproduced  by 
mechanisms  A  and  B  but  shows  some  different  behavior  in  the  case  of  mechanism  C.

Fig.  2.5.  Comparison  [6]  the  theoretical  results  with  experimental  data. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  difference  in  mechanisms  A  and  C  is  mainly  in  the  amount  of  car¬ 
bon  in  solid  state  produced  in  the  condensed  phase  decomposition  and  in  the  value  of  heat  re¬ 
leased  during  this  decomposition.  In  the  case  of  mechanism  C  the  fraction  of  solid  carbon  is  neg¬ 
ligible  and  the  heat  released  in  the  condensed  phase  is  significantly  higher  (ca.  105  cal/g  against 
18  cal/g  of  mechanism  A). 

When  comparing  between  different  mechanisms  simulating  the  GAP  combustion  behavior,  one 
has  to  consult  with  available  experimental  data.  Unfortunately,  the  volume  of  these  data  is  ex¬ 
tremely  small  and  there  exists  urgent  need  in  obtaining  new  experimental  information.  It  regards 
the  quantitative  data  on  species  concentrations,  temperature  profile,  burning  rate  sensitivities.  At 
present  time  it  seems  incorrect  to  compare  calculated  by  particular  reaction  scheme  flame  tem¬ 
perature  with  thermal-equilibrium  temperature  because  there  are  experimental  evidences  that  the 
flame  temperature  in  the  GAP  combustion  wave  is  surprisingly  low.  At  the  same  time  a  compari¬ 
son  with  very  high  burning  rate  temperature  sensitivity  data,  reported  in  Ref.  [1],  looks  non- 
justified  because  expected  from  transient  combustion  theory  [15]  behavior  of  this  propellant  is 


2—57 


very  unstable  (the  modeling  concerns  only  steady-state  regimes).  Surprisingly,  there  is  only  one 

observation  in  available  literature  [3]  about  self-extinquishment  of  the  GAP  propellant  at  atmos¬ 
pheric  pressure.

2.4.  COMBUSTION  OF  HNF. 


Hydrazinium  nitroformate  N2H4C(N02)3,  (HNF)  is  one  of  the  promising  candidates  for  replace¬ 
ment  of  ammonium  perchlorate  as  an  oxidizer  in  propellant  formulations.  First  publications  about 
the  use  of  HNF  in  SP  appeared  in  the  60’s  and  70’s  in  the  United  States  [1,2].  Some  later  the 
Russian  researchers  published  the  results  of  HNF  thermal  decomposition  studies  [3].  It  was  stated 
in  one  of  the  earliest  papers  [4]  that  HNF  is  not  compatible  with  the  double  bonds  in  the  binders 
like  HTPB.  Fortunately,  the  latest  studies  [5],  conducted  in  Netherlands,  revealed  good  compati¬ 
bility  of  HNF  with  new  energetic  binders  like  GAP  or  BAMO.  This  gave  great  impact  to  investi¬ 
gation  of  combustion  mechanism  of  neat  HNF  and  HNF  containing  propellants. 

Physicochemical  properties. 

Neat  HNF  consists  of  the  needle-like  crystals  with  density  of  1.86  g/cm3  and  melting  temperature 
124°C.Its  thermal  diffusivity  equals  1.63  10'3  cm2/s  at  room  temperature  [6]. 

In  the  first  experiments  [1],  NO2  was  detected  as  one  of  the  major  decomposition  products  of 
HNF.  It  was  assumed  that  NO2  reacts  with  HNF  generating  again  NO2.  Thermocouple  measure¬ 
ments  [2]  have  shown  3  zones  in  the  combustion  wave:  first  heating  up  to  120°C,  then  develop¬ 
ment  of  the  bubble  zone  in  the  range  120-260°C,  and  subsequent  gasification  above  260°C. 
Thermal  decomposition  under  fast  heating  (T-jump  technique)  revealed  below  260°C  the  first 
stage  [7]  as  endothermal  degradation  of  HNF  to  hydrazine  and  nitroform.  With  increase  in  the 
temperature  of  HNF  only  small  molecules,  like  H2,  H2O,  N2,  NO  and  CO2,  were  detected. 

The  neat  HNF  burning  rate  is  relatively  fast.  It  equals  ca.  6.5  mm/s  at  10  atm  and  ca.  30  mm/s  at 
70  atm.  The  burning  rate  pressure  exponent  equals  about  0.83  and  burning  rate  temperature  sen¬ 
sitivity  equals  0.0012K'1  [8].  Detailed  measurements  of  burning  rate  revealed  change  in  the  pres¬ 
sure  dependence  at  moderate  pressures:  a  slope  breaks  around  20  atm  changing  from  n  =  0.95  at 
law  to  n  =  0.85  at  higher  pressures  [9]. 


Pressure  [MPa] 

Fig.  2.6.  The  burning  rate  versus  pressure  data  [8,9]. 


Fig.  2.7.  The  burning  surface  temperature  versus  pressure  data  [8,9]. 

This  is  seen  in  Fig.  2.6  where  burning  rate  versus  pressure  data  [8,9]  are  presented.  The  burning 
surface  temperature  increases  with  pressure.  It  equals  530K  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  reaches 
approximately  675K  [9]  at  P  =  10  atm  (Fig.  2.7).  The  addition  of  small  amount  of  solid  carbon 
(graphite)  to  the  neat  HNF  leads  to  slight  increase  in  the  burning  rate  at  moderate  pressures.  In 
this  pressure  range  (self  sustaining  combustion  regime  of  HNF  exists  starting  from  pressure  0.3 
atm)  the  pressure  exponent  decreases  up  to  n  =  0.81  for  HNF/5%  graphite  mixture  [9].  The  addi¬ 
tion  of  paraffin  (10-20%)  leads  to  decrease  in  a  burning  rate  by  about  2  times  at  moderate  pres¬ 
sures  (1-20  atm). 

Combustion  simulation. 

Because  of  the  lack  of  knowledge  of  the  physical  mechanism  of  HNF  combustion  and  relatively 
short  history  of  its  studying  the  number  of  works  devoted  to  mathematical  modeling  is  very  re¬ 
stricted.  One  of  the  first  models  of  HNF  stationary  combustion  has  been  presented  in  Ref.  10.  Its 
further  development  and  extension  is  made  in  Ref.  11.  In  the  model,  the  condensed  phase  is  de¬ 
scribed  in  one-dimensional  formulation  with  single  endothermal  global  decomposition  reaction  of 
zero-order.  The  products  of  condensed  phase  decomposition  react  further  in  the  gas  phase  ac¬ 
cording  to  bimolecular  irreversible  global  reaction: 

B+M  -*  C  +  M 

Here  B  represents  unstable  intermidiate  species  of  condensed  phase  decomposition  such  as  NO2, 
HONO,  N2O,  etc.  Species  M  may  represent  unstable  species  such  as  N,  H  and  OH,  or  any  gas 
species.  It  is  assumed  that  the  gas  phase  reaction  is  highly  exothermic  and  can  be  described  in 
two  ways:  low-activation-energy  limit  [12]  and  classical  high-activation-energy  limit  [13].  In  the 
case  of  low  activation  limit  the  species  M  are  treated  as  unspecified  chain  carriers,  whose  mass 
fraction  is  constant  and  negligibly  small  as  compared  to  the  main  species  B  and  C.  Therefore  gas 
phase  reaction  is  second-order  overall  and  first  order  with  respect  to  B.  In  the  case  of  high  acti¬ 
vation  limit  the  gas  phase  reaction  is  treated  in  terms  of  classical  thermal  decomposition. 


2—60 


The  model  is  formulated  on  the  basis  of  several  simplified  assumptions:  equality  of  the  molecular 
weights  for  all  species,  constant  thermophysical  coefficients,  equality  of  the  Lewis  number  to 
unity.  The  condensed  phase  surface  is  illuminated  by  external  laser  flux  with  radiative  energy 
Qr(W/m2).  Radiative  energy  absorbs  in  the  bulk  of  material  according  to  Beer’s  law  with  absorp¬ 
tion  coefficient  Ka. 


Solution  of  the  energy  equation  for  the  condensed  phase  gives  expression  for  the  mass  burning 
rate  m  in  the  form  [14,15]: 


m2  AJBT?k'S>eexp(-Ee/FTM) 
Ec[Cc(Ts-T0)-Qc/2-frQr/m] 


(2.22) 


Here  Ac  and  Ec  are  pre-exponent  and  activation  energy,  Xc  is  the  thermal  conductivity.  Qc  is  the 
heat  of  reaction,  fr  is  the  fraction  of  Qr  absorbed  below  the  surface  reaction  zone.  In  particular 
case  of  HNF  Qc  =  -7.2  cal/g,  i.e.  the  reaction  is  endothermal,  and  Ec  =  18000  cal/mol. 


Heat  balance  at  the  interface  gives  expression  for  calculation  of  the  burning  surface  temperature: 

Ts=T0+Qc/cp+  [Xg(dT/dx)x=0  +  Qr  ](  mcp  f 


To  calculate  the  term  \g  (dT/dx)x=0,  the  equations  of  energy  and  species  conservation  in  the  gas 
phase  under  assumption  of  low  activation  energy,  Eg  —>  0,  have  to  be  solved.  Finally,  one  obtains

where  Kg  is  the  characteristic  reaction  zone  width  in  the  gas  phase.

The  flame  temperature  Tf  is  calculated  from  the  total  heat  balance:

When  taking  Eg  =40000  cal/mol  and  Qg  =  583  cal/g,  the  authors  [11]  calculated  the  burning  rate 
versus  pressure  dependence  and  compared  with  similar  calculations  for  the  case  Eg  — >  0.  The  lat¬ 
ter  calculations  gave  better  agreement  with  experimental  data.  It  turned  out  that  the  model  with 
Eg  — »  0  gave  also  better  agreement  with  experimental  values  of  the  burning  rate  initial  tempera¬ 
ture  coefficient  and  burning  surface  temperature  in  dependence  of  pressure.  The  conclusion  is 
made  that  simplified  model  with  low  activation  energy  of  gas  phase  reactions  may  provide  good 
description  of  experimental  observations. 


The  attempt  to  construct  transient  combustion  model  for  neat  HNF  is  presented  in  Ref.  16.  The 
model  is  formulated  within  the  framework  of  QSHOD  approach  (quasi-steady  gas  phase,  homo¬ 
geneous,  one-dimensional).  Heat  propagation  in  the  condensed  phase  is  described  by  one¬ 
dimensional  thermal  conductivity  equation  with  heat  release  term  for  zero-order  reaction.  The 
boundary  condition  for  energy  equation  at  the  burning  surface  is  written  in  the  simple  form  of 
equality  of  heat  fluxes  at  the  interface. 

\ 


2—61 


Heat  propagation  in  the  gas  phase  is  described  by  KTSS-type  model  [17]  with  constant  heat  re¬ 
lease  uniformly  distributed  over  the  reaction  zone  attached  to  the  burning  surface.  To  match  the 
floating  coefficients,  the  values  at  atmospheric  pressure  of  the  burning  rate  0.68  mm/s  and  sur¬ 
face  temperature  553  K  were  used.  Calculations  by  the  model  agree  well  with  experimental  data 
on  stationary  self-sustaining  and  laser-assisted  combustion.  The  response  to  perturbations  of  ex¬ 
ternal  radiant  flux  turned  out  over  predicted  at  high  frequencies  when  compared  with  laser  recoil 
experiment  [18].  However,  agreement  becomes  better  if  experimental  data  are  corrected  on  the 
constancy  of  radiation  power. 

Critical  comments. 

Despite  demonstration  of  good  correlation  between  theoretical  predictions  and  experimental 
findings  there  is  a  strong  need  in  further  investigation  of  the  details  of  the  HNF  combustion 
mechanism,  both  experimentally  and  theoretically.  Indeed,  the  fact  of  melting  at  relatively  low 
temperature  means  that  subsurface  layer  of  HNF  is  in  a  liquid  state  and  one  may  expect  the  pres¬ 
ence  of  HNF  vapors  above  the  burning  surface.  This  is  very  probable  event  because  of  (according 
to  [16])  endothermal  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase.  In  the  case  of  evaporation,  the  mathemati¬ 
cal  model  has  to  be  supplemented  with  appropriate  term  in  the  heat  balance  at  the  surface  as  well 
with  additional  condition  on  the  value  of  the  burning  surface.  The  latter,  if  taken  in  the  form  of 
the  Clausius-Clapeyron  type  equation,  may  provide  convenient  tool  to  calculate  the  burning  sur¬ 
face  temperature  in  dependence  on  pressure.  It  should  be  also  underlined  the  need  in  the  proper 
accounting  for  every  phase  transition  in  the  combustion  model.  In  particular,  the  calculations  of 
the  burning  rate  response  to  perturbations  of  the  external  heat  flux,  if  made  without  taking  into 
account  the  effect  of  melting,  lead  to  wrong  theoretical  predictions  [19].  Therefore  the  results, 
presented  in  Ref.  [16]  should  be  thoroughly  checked  on  this  matter.

2.5.  COMBUSTION  OF  ADN 


Ammonium  salt  of  dinitramide,  NH4N(N02)2  (ADN),  is  another  promising  candidate  for  use  in 
solid  propellants  as  an  effective  chlorine-free  oxidizer. 

Physicochemical  properties. 

ADN  density  equals  1.82  g/cm3  and  melting  temperature  equals  92°C.  The  combustion  tempera¬ 
ture  of  neat  ADN  is  of  moderate  value  and  reaches  2060  K  at  pressure  70  atm.  The  temperature 
profile  in  the  combustion  wave  exhibits  at  low  pressures  3  distinctive  extended  zones  (see  Fig. 
2.8)  with  very  weak  heat  feedback  from  the  gas  flame. 

Experimentally,  it  was  established  [1]  that  the  neat  ADN  bums  steadily  in  the  pressure  range  2-20 
atm  and  above  100  atm.  At  pressures  below  2  atm  combustion  of  thoroughly  purified  neat  ADN 
does  not  exist  but  mixture  of  ADN  and  0.2%  paraffin  bums  steadily  starting  at  least  from  0.2  atm. 
Self  sustaining  combustion  of  thovoughly  purified  ADN  was  observed  at  atmospheric  pressure 
only  under  heating  of  the  pressed  samples  up  to  the  temperature  100°C.  It  is  interesting  to  note 
that  self  sustaining  combustion  of  pressed  ADN  samples  was  observed  in  [2]  under  atmospheric 
pressure  at  initial  temperature  25°  C.  The  reason  for  such  differences  in  combustion  behavior  of 
different  ADN  samples  might  be  different  degree  of  purification  of  the  ADN  powder  [3].  Meas¬ 
urement  of  the  burning  surface  temperature  at  relatively  high  burning  rates  represents  difficult 
technical  task.  Therefore,  experimental  data  are  available  only  for  low  pressures.  According  to 
Ref.  [1],  Ts  equals  ca.  320°C  at  P=2  atm  and  about  380°C  at  P=5  atm.  According  to  Ref.  [2],  the 
burning  surface  temperature  equals  400°C  at  P=3  atm.

Thermal  decomposition  of  ADN  in  conditions  of  slow  heating  rate  (2  K/min)  exhibits  onset  of 
exothermic  reactions  at  127°C  with  heat  of  decomposition  about  61  Kcal/mol  [4].  It  was  proposed 
that  the  decomposition  is  initiated  by  dissociation  of  ADN  in  the  melt  layer  to  ammonia  NH3  and 
hydrogen  dinitramide  HN(N02)2  [4,5]  followed  by  exothermal  decomposition  of  HN(N02)2  pro¬ 
ducing  N2  O  and  HNO3.

In  the  experiments  with  fast  (2000  K/sec)  heating  of  thin  ADN  film  on  a  platinum  filament  to 
260°C  and  subsequent  keeping  filament  at  this  temperature  it  was  found  [6]  that  at  the  beginning 
ADN  decomposes  to  NH3,  HNO3  and  N2O,  which  form  in  comparable  amounts  as  detected  by 
FTIR  method.  However,  this  is  mildly  endothermic  reaction  and  does  not  account  for  major  heat 
release.  Therefore  it  was  proposed  that  under  rapid  thermolysis  conditions  dissociation  of  ADN, 
producing  NH3  and  HN(NC>2)2,  dominates.  Subsequent  interaction  between  NH3  and  NO2  may 
provide  high  exothermicity  in  the  bubbling  surface  layer  or  in  the  gas  phase  near  the  surface. 

In  addition,  it  was  proposed  theoretically  [7]  and  confirmed  by  experimental  findings  [8]  direct 
evaporation  of  ADN  at  high  temperatures  with  subsequent  degradation  in  the  gas  phase  onto  NH3 
and  HN(N02)2.  The  experiments  were  conducted  with  tiny  amount  (10  4  g)  of  ADN  heated  on  the 
metal  ribbon  with  the  rate  of  90  K/s  or  in  the  regime  of  electrical  discharge  (heating  time  0.01  s). 
Decomposition  products  were  recorded  with  a  time-of-flight  mass-spectrometer.  It  was  found  [8] 
that  under  vacuum  conditions  (P=10'6  Torr)  the  mass-spectrum  of  decomposed  ADN  differs  sig¬ 
nificantly  of  that  under  subatmospheric  and  atmospheric  pressure.  It  was  suggested  that  this  was 
caused  by  adsorption  of  gaseous  ADN  and  its  decomposition  products  on  the  walls  of  the  vacuum 
chamber.  The  experiments  under  pressure  1-6  Torr  showed  that  unlike  other  ammonia  salts,  ADN 
evaporates  into  gas  phase  as  whole  molecule  and  decomposition  on  ammonia  and  hydrogen  dini- 
tramide  occurs  later  at  higher  gas  temperatures. 

Combustion  simulation. 

It  follows  from  the  measurements  of  thermal  profile  that  at  pressures  below  3  atm  ADN  bums 
without  luminous  flame  [1,2].  Examination  of  the  temperature  distribution  shows  that  at  moder¬ 
ate  pressures  (below  10  atm)  the  heat  feedback  from  the  gas  phase  is  negligible  in  the  heat  bal¬ 
ance  on  the  burning  surface  and  the  burning  rate  is  controlled  by  the  condensed  phase  reactions. 
Mass-spectra  of  gas  samples,  taken  near  the  burning  surface  of  ADN  at  3  atm,  show  the  presence 
of  gaseous  ADN  and  hydrogen  dinitramide  [8].  With  the  pressure  increase  up  to  6  atm  the  second 
high  temperature  zone  appears  at  the  height  of  6-8  mm  above  the  burning  surface.  The  main  re¬ 
action  in  this  zone  is  supposed  to  be  ammonia  oxidation  by  nitric  acid. 

Qualitative  description  of  the  ADN  combustion  mechanism  has  been  presented  in  the  following 
way  [1].  It  is  assumed  that  in  the  melt  layer  at  the  surface  the  ADN  decomposes  to  form  con¬ 
densed  ammonium  nitrate  and  gaseous  N2O.  Bubbling  of  the  surface  layer  leads  at  low  pressures 
to  formation  of  ejected  drops  of  condensed  material  consisting  of  ADN  and  ammonium  nitrate 
with  ADN  content  decreasing  sharply  with  pressure.  The  burning  surface  temperature  is  deter¬ 
mined  by  dissociation  of  ammonium  nitrate.  The  temperature  in  the  second  flame  zone  is  con¬ 
trolled  by  oxidation  of  ammonia  (1000-1200°C).  Partially  unreacted  N2O  decomposes  in  the  third 
flame  zone  observed  at  pressures  above  10  MPa.  Unstable  combustion  of  ADN  in  the  range  of 
20-100  atm  is  caused  by  overheating  in  the  subsurface  melted  layer  due  to  excessive  heat  release 
in  the  condensed  phase.  At  higher  than  100  atm  pressures  the  gas-phase  reactions  are  likely  to 
play  a  dominant  role  in  ADN  combustion.  Similar  conclusions  about  the  combustion  mechanism 
of  different  dinitramide  salts  were  made  in  Ref.  [9].

Quantitative  description  of  the  gas  flame  mechanism  in  ADN  combustion  has  been  presented  in 
Ref.  [10].  The  system  of  equations  for  one-dimensional  nonstationary  flow  of  reacting  gas  mix¬ 
ture  was  solved  with  the  method  of  the  problem  solution  given  in  [11].  Kinetic  mechanism  of  the 
flame  reactions  includes  high  temperature  submechanism  for  the  mixture 
NH3/N2O/NO/NO2/HNO3/H2O/N2  with  addition  of  stages  that  involve  vapor  of  ADN,  HN(NC>2)2 
and  NH2NO2.  Total  number  of  stages  equals  203. 

To  obtain  stationary  solution  of  the  problem,  boundary  conditions  at  the  fixed  coordinate  near  the 
burning  surface  were  set  according  to  experimental  data  [8].  Boundary  conditions  downstream  of 
the  gas  flow  corresponded  to  equilibrium  terms.  An  example  of  the  gas  composition  at  the  begin¬ 
ning  of  the  space  coordinate  is  shown  below  in  mole  percentages:

In  calculations,  the  surface  temperature  was  taken  equal  to  400°C  and  mass  flow  rate  at  P=3  atm 
equal  to  1.97  g/cm2s.  Comparison  with  experimental  data  on  species  concentrations  in  flameless 
combustion  regime  (temperature  does  not  exceed  800  K)  showed  good  agreement  except  spatial 
species  distribution  for  NH3.  Better  agreement  was  achieved  with  zero  concentration  of  ADN 
vapor  in  the  boundary  condition. 

Chemical  structure  of  the  second  flame  zone  (maximal  temperature  1500K)  was  calculated  for 
the  pressure  6  atm.  Temperature  and  species  concentration  profiles  turned  out  to  be  in  a  good 
agreement  with  experimental  data.  The  third  flame  zone  is  realized  theoretically  at  the  distance  of 
8000  mm  from  the  burning  surface  with  final  temperature  of  about  2200  K.  The  results  of  calcu¬ 
lations  demonstrate  the  urgent  need  in  more  detailed  experimental  data  on  species  concentrations, 
especially  in  the  vicinity  of  the  burning  surface.  In  fact,  there  is  no  available  in  the  literature  of 
reliable  evidences  of  quantified  measures  of  the  ADN  vapors,  which  is  very  difficult  to  detect. 
Precise  measurement  of  the  mole  fraction  of  NH3  close  to  the  burning  surface  would  give  impor¬ 
tant  information  for  substantiation  of  the  calculations  by  detailed  chemistry  mechanism.

2.6.  COMBUSTION  OF  AMMONIUM  PERCHLORATE 


Ammonium  perchlorate  (AP)  relates  to  the  compounds  with  large  excess  of  oxygen.  This  pro¬ 
vides  possibilities  for  its  wide  application  as  an  oxidizer  in  various  composite  propellants.  Begin¬ 
ning  to  the  systematic  studies  of  mechanism  and  combustion  law  of  AP  has  been  established  by 
the  work  of  Friedman  with  co-workers  [1],  in  which  the  existence  of  the  lower  and  upper  pressure 
limits  of  combustion  was  discovered.  The  numerous  investigations,  carried  out  in  the  recent  dec¬ 
ades,  made  it  possible  to  get  more  details  of  the  AP  combustion  behavior  over  a  wide  range  of 
pressure  and  initial  temperatures.  Thus,  it  was  revealed  that  the  pressure  upper  limit  of  combus¬ 
tion  (-270  atm,  according  to  [1])  in  many  respects  was  obliged  to  heat  losses  from  the  combus¬ 
tion  wave.  Later  it  was  established  that  even  under  conditions,  when  the  heat  losses  were  reduced 
to  the  minimum  (large  diameter  of  sample,  shell  of  thermal  insulation  material),  the  dependence 
of  the  burning  rate  on  pressure  remained  anomalous. 

The  plot  of  dependence  of  AP  burning  rate  on  pressure  can  be  conditionally  divided  [2]  into  four 
characteristic  domains  (Fig.  2.9.).  Combustion  in  domains  1,  2  and  4  is  stable  and  characterized 
by  the  positive  value  of  the  derivative  dm/dp.  Combustion  in  domain  3  has  an  unstable  (pulsat¬ 
ing)  character.  The  deepest  decrease  in  the  burning  rate  (domain  3)  has  been  observed  for  single 
AP  crystals  [2].  In  the  case  of  the  combustion  of  pressed  tablets  of  AP  in  the  combustible  or 
thermal  insulation  shells  the  depth  of  this  minimum  is  reduced,  and  in  certain  cases  it  is  substi¬ 
tuted  by  plateau  [2]. 

Location  of  boundaries  of  chosen  domain  depends  on  initial  temperature  of  the  AP  samples.  The 
lower  pressure  limit  of  AP  combustion  is  -  20  atm  at  20  °C  [3]  and  -  15  atm  at  To  =  50  °C.  Un¬ 
stable  combustion  behavior  begins  with  p  =  140-150  atm  and  it  changes  again  into  stable  with  p  = 
280-300  atm. 

Boundary  between  1  and  2  domains  (p  =  56-70  atm,  [39])  separates  combustion  regime  with  con¬ 
stant  pressure  exponent  v  in  the  burning  law,  m  -  pv  (v  =  0.77  [2]  in  domain  1)  and  regime  with 
variable  v,  which  is  gradually  decreased  in  value  with  the  pressure  increase.  The  microscopic 
study  of  the  extinguished  crystals  of  AP  [2]  revealed  that  structure  of  the  burning  surface  in  the 
above  regimes  is  different.  In  the  domain  1  the  surface  of  AP  is  covered  with  small  bubbles  and 
foam  while  in  the  domain  2  it  is  porous. 

On  the  surface  of  samples,  which  burned  in  domain  3,  according  to  [3],  separate  pockets  are  ob¬ 
served  with  needle-like  formations,  concentrated  in  the  regions  of  the  greatest  bum  out  of  sur¬ 
face.  With  further  increase  in  pressure  (domain  4)  needles  cover  the  entire  surface.

2—68 


Character  of  dependence  of  the  burning  rate  on  pressure  and  examination  of  a  fine  structure  of 
the  surface  layer  testify  for  complexity  of  processes,  which  occur  in  the  wave  of  AP  combustion. 
The  vast  studies  of  the  mechanism  of  AP  thermal  decomposition  both  in  the  low-temperature  (at 
T<300  °C)  and  high-temperature  (at  T>380  °C)  regimes  demonstrated  [4],  that  the  examination  of 
the  condensed  phase  decomposition  of  AP  within  the  framework  of  the  concept  of  the  single  rate 
control  stage  does  not  make  it  possible  to  explain  entire  set  of  experimental  results.  Nevertheless 
the  majority  of  researchers  came  to  the  conclusion  about  the  important  role  of  AP  dissociation  in 
the  condensed  phase  on  ammonia  and  perchloric  acid  with  their  subsequent  vaporization. 

Developing  the  model  of  AP  combustion,  V.  A.  Strunin  and  G.  B.  Manelis  have  used  a  concept 
of  the  rate  control  role  of  exothermal  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase.  According  to  [5,  6],  de¬ 
composition  of  AP  occurs  in  the  wave  of  combustion  via  following  routes: 


I'1?.

B= 


(2.24) 


Mass  fraction  r|s  of  the  parent  substance  Ac  is  decomposed  in  the  condensed  phase  to  final  prod¬ 
ucts  Bg  and  remaining  part  (l-r)s)  dissociates  to  ammonia  and  perchloric  acid  (Ag')  and  then  va¬ 
porizes  and  produces  finally  Bg. 


Complete  system  of  equations,  which  describes  course  of  global  reactions  according  to  diagram 
(2.24),  is  given  in  [6].  From  the  numerical  analysis  of  the  problem  it  follows  that  depending  on 
the  particular  values  of  the  input  parameters  (thermal  effects  of  stages  and  kinetic  constants),  as 
in  the  case  of  the  consecutive  reactions  (see  Section  1.2.2),  different  combustion  regimes  can  re¬ 
alize.  These  are  regimes  with  the  rate  control  reactions  in  the  condensed  or  in  the  gas  phase.  In 
the  combustion  regime  with  the  rate  control  condensed  phase  reactions  equation  (1.20)  is  valid 
for  the  mass  burning  rate  m  [5]: 

m2  =(pX/J0Q)(RT2/E)k0exp(-E/RTs)  (2.25) 

Here  for  the  zero-order  reactions 

Jo  =  0.5  ris2 

And  for  the  first-order  reactions: 


h  =%+[l-%-<ls/(mQ)]ln(l-ir)s) 

where  qs  =  A(dT/dx)x=o  ~0  (gas-phase  reactions  proceed  in  the  regime  of  stage  detachment);  Q  - 
thermal  effect  of  decomposition  upon  stage  Ac  — >  B. 

In  (2.25),  the  value  of  m  depends  on  the  surface  temperature  Ts  and  on  the  value  of  r\s,  which  de¬ 
termines  shared  contribution  of  two  competing  stages  Ac  — >  Ag  and  Ac  — >  Bg  in  gasification  of 
parent  substance.  In  [5,6]  for  closing  the  problem  the  two  additional  relationships  are  used:  equa¬ 
tion  of  the  balance  of  heat  at  the  burning  surface

and  the  relationship  for  the  partial  pressures  of  the  products  of  sublimation  ps  and  decomposition 
products  of  the  condensed  phase  (p-ps) 

(p-ps)/ps  =  (rd/rs)Tis/(l-Tis)  (2.27) 

Here  p  -  external  pressure;  rd  and  rs  -  number  of  moles,  which  are  generated  during  decomposition 
and  sublimation  of  one  mole  of  parent  substance,  respectively.  Relationship  (2.27)  is  written  un¬

System  of  equations  (2.25)-(2.28)  makes  it  possible  to  compute  the  burning  rate  of  combustion 
depending  on  the  external  parameters  in  the  combustion  regime  with  the  rate  control  condensed 
phase  reactions. 

For  the  burning  rate  temperature  coefficient  the  formula  is  obtained,  which  has  the  form  [7]: 

P  =  ainm/dTo  =  (E/2L)(Tm-Ts)"1+(Ts-To)"1  (2.29) 

The  formula  is  valid  for  moderate  pressure  when  L(Tm-Ts)/RTs2»l.  Here  Tm  is  the  maximum 

combustion  temperature. 

At  low  pressures  the  variation  of  (3  is  determined  mainly  by  the  second  term  in  (2.29),  which  is 
reduced  with  increase  in  p.  At  higher  pressures  the  first  term,  which  grows  with  increase  in  p,  is 
responsible  for  the  variation  of  (3.  Thus,  dependence  P(p)  in  the  wide  pressure  range  is  depicted 
by  the  curve  with  minimum.  Calculation  of  dependence  (3(p)  for  AP,  carried  out  in  Ref.  [7],  is 
satisfactorily  agreed  with  the  experimental  data.  This  may  serve  indirect  evidence  of  the  validity 
of  the  proposed  model  for  AP  combustion  with  the  rate  control  condensed  phase  reactions.  How¬ 
ever,  the  results  of  calculation  of  the  burning  rate  pressure  sensitivity  do  not  allow  making  opti¬ 
mistic  conclusion.  Indeed,  the  formula  for  coefficient  v  has  the  form: 

v  =  d  In  m/d  In  p  *  E/2L,  if  ocL/RTs2»l. 

Here  E  -  energy  of  the  activation  for  transition  A— >B  in  diagram  (2.24),  a  =  (l-r|s)[r|s+(l-r|s)  rs/ 
rd]  (Q-L)/c.  With  an  increase  in  the  pressure  the  sublimation  is  depressed,  and  v  is  weakly  re¬ 
duced.  In  the  extreme  case,  when  p  — »  °°,  then  r\s  — »  1  and  v  — >  0  (m  — »  const). 

Such  behavior  of  m(p)  does  not  meet  with  experimental  observations  and,  by  the  opinion  of 
authors  [6],  is  the  consequence  of  excessive  idealization  of  the  processes  in  the  condensed  phase 
of  burning  AP.  In  [8,  9],  more  detailed  diagram  of  AP  combustion  has  been  examined:

According  to  (2.30),  stage  1  -  dissociation  of  initial  substance;  2,  3  -  condensed  phase  decompo¬

In  addition,  equations  of  mass  conservation  during  dissolution  and  sublimation  are  included. 

Under  the  assumption  that  exothermic  condensed  phase  reactions  (stages  6,  7  occur  in  regime  of 
stage  detachment)  still  remain  rate  controlling  in  AP  combustion,  approximate  equation  for  the 
burning  rate  was  obtained  [8,  9].

On  the  basis  of  data  stating  greater  pressure  of  the  ammonia  vapors  in  comparison  with  the  pres¬ 
sure  of  perchloric  acid  vapors,  the  conclusion  was  made  that  in  AP  combustion  the  solubility  of 
perchloric  acid  in  the  condensed  phase  is  relatively  higher,  i.e.,  KHCl0t  >  KNH^ .  Because  of  this 

with  the  pressure  increase,  in  accordance  with  to  (2.32)  and  (2.33)  the  drop  in  the  burning  rate 
must  occur.  Possible  formation  within  the  condensed  phase  of  the  intermediate  products,  which 
displace  equilibrium  in  favor  of  NH3  (for  example,  it  can  be  water)  even  more  strengthens  this 
drop  in  the  rate.  Thus,  according  to  the  data  [3],  at  pressure  ~150  atm  the  temperature  on  the 


2—71 


burning  surface  of  AP  (-320  °C)  approximately  corresponds  to  the  boiling  point  of  water  (-360 
°C).  Beginning  from  this  pressure,  the  burning  rate  of  AP  is  reduced  and  the  character  of  com¬ 
bustion  becomes  unstable. 

Combustion  stability  of  AP  within  the  framework  of  the  above  model  has  been  analyzed  in  [9, 
10].  It  was  shown  that  the  account  of  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  heat  of  sublimation  L 
leads  to  the  fact  that  when  the  initial  temperature  increases  the  criterion  of  intrinsic  combustion 
stability  (with  respect  to  B.  V.  Novozhilov  [11])  ceases  to  be  fulfilled.  Moreover,  the  intermedi¬ 
ate  combustion  instability  pressure  domain  may  exist.  Combustion  in  this  domain  is  unstable,  but 
out  of  the  domain  it  is  stable.  The  form  of  the  calculated  domain  of  unsteady  combustion  qualita¬ 
tively  agrees  with  the  experimental  data  for  the  number  of  organic  amine  perchlorate. 

It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  detailed  mechanism  of  decomposition  and  combustion  of  AP  still  re¬ 
mains  unclear  despite  intense  research  work  during  last  more  than  three  decades.  Especially  it 
regards  to  description  of  the  condensed  phase  reactions.  In  addition  to  described  above  global  ki¬ 
netic  mechanism  several  attempts  to  develop  more  comprehensive  reaction  schemes  were  under¬ 
taken.  One  of  the  first  one  was  made  in  1971  [12]  with  single  global  reaction  in  the  condensed 
phase  and  14  gas  phase  reactions.  In  fact,  it  was  extended  semi-global  mechanism  and  its  back¬ 
ground  was  not  well  justified.  Subsequent  works  by  Ermolin  et  al.  [13  -  16],  published  in  1982  - 
1995,  gave  rather  detailed  and  substantiated  scheme  of  gas  phase  reactions  but  did  not  concern 
any  details  of  the  condensed  phase  reactions.  Only  recently  new  experimental  data  became  avail¬ 
able  that  gave  more  insight  into  condensed  phase  decomposition  reactions  [17].  Based  on  these 
and  other  available  data  the  AP  condensed  phase  4  step  mechanism  was  formulated  in  [18].  It 
was  suggested  that  due  to  high  pressure  existing  in  the  bubbles  inside  subsurface  liquid  layer  of 
AP,  the  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  go  to  completion  and  produce  final  products  according 
to  equation 

4AP  ->  3.25  HC1  +  5.875  H20  +  1.146  02  +  1.833  N20  +  0.375  Cl2  +  0.33  NH3 

The  calculations  of  the  AP  burning  rate  were  performed  [18]  with  use  of  mentioned  4  step  con¬ 
densed  phase  mechanism  and  slightly  modified  Ermolin’ s  79  step  gas  phase  mechanism.  The  re¬ 
sults  of  calculations  exhibited  good  agreement  with  experimental  data  [13]  on  temperature  and 
species  space  distribution  in  combustion  of  AP  at  subatmospheric  pressure  0.6  atm.  Comparison 
with  available  experimental  data  on  burning  rate  and  its  temperature  sensitivity  in  the  pressure 
range  30-110  atm  showed  important  role  of  condensed  phase  reactions  in  getting  better  agree¬ 
ment  with  calculation  results  [18].  As  in  a  previous  work  of  the  same  group  [19],  the  conclusion 
can  be  made  about  urgent  need  for  more  precise  and  detailed  experimental  data  on  combustion 
characteristics  of  AP  in  order  to  substantiate  contemporary  most  comprehensive  mathematical 
description  of  the  combustion  mechanism.

2.7.  COMBUSTION  OF  DOUBLE  BASE  PROPELLANTS 


P.  F.  Pokhil  and  his  coworkers  of  the  (Semenov)  Institute  of  Chemical  Physics,  Moscow  con¬ 
ducted  in  50’s  systematic  experimental  studies  of  mechanism  and  laws  governing  stationary  com¬ 
bustion  of  DB  propellants  in  broad  ranges  of  pressure  and  initial  temperatures.  In  the  course  of 
the  study  of  the  combustion  mechanism  two  experimental  findings  of  fundamental  value  were 
obtained  [1]:  a)  the  chemical  reactions  of  gasification  of  the  condensed  phase  of  DB  propellant 
are  summary  exothermic;  b)  the  process  of  gasification  is  accompanied  by  the  dispersion  of  a 
significant  part  of  the  condensed  phase. 

The  value  of  these  findings  for  subsequent  development  of  the  combustion  theory  of  propellants 
is  difficult  to  overestimate.  They  became  the  basis  of  contemporary  concepts  about  the  mecha¬ 
nism  of  DB  propellant  combustion  and  initiated  number  of  theoretical  and  experimental  works. 

In  existing  theoretical  works  the  concepts  of  multi  stage  structure  of  the  combustion  wave  are 
extensively  used.  According  to  Refs.  [1-4],  exothermic  reactions  during  combustion  of  DB  pro¬ 
pellants  occur  in  a  subsurface  layer  of  the  condensed  phase,  in  the  particles  belonging  the  dis¬ 
perse  zone,  and  in  the  gaseous  decomposition  products  of  the  condensed  phase. 

In  [1,  5-8]  approximate  estimates  were  given  for  contribution  of  different  stages  to  the  heat  bal¬ 
ance  on  the  burning  surface  of  DB  propellants.  It  was  found  that  the  heat  release  in  the  condensed 
phase  of  DB  propellant,  which  represents  a  relatively  small  portion  of  the  total  amount  of  heat 
released  in  the  combustion  (-7-15%  depending  on  the  pressure  and  initial  temperature),  gives  70- 
100%  of  amount  of  heat  needed  for  stationary  combustion  wave  propagation.  With  increase  in 
pressure  (p  <  100  atm)  and  the  initial  temperature  the  role  of  the  condensed  phase  reactions,  ac¬ 
cording  to  [1,  6,  9],  increases.  This  fact  requires  special  attention  to  be  paid  to  studying  the  proc¬ 
esses,  which  take  place  in  the  condensed  phase  of  the  burning  propellant. 

Magnitude  of  thermal  effect  of  decomposition  EM  in  the  condensed  phase  and  temperature  on  the 
burning  surface  Ts  are  closely  related  to  the  scale  of  dispersion;  Ts  depends  on  the  consumed  por¬ 
tion  of  EM  in  the  condensed  phase.  The  burning  rate  depends  in  turn  on  the  value  of  Ts.  The  sys¬ 
tematic  experimental  studies  of  the  dispersion,  carried  out  in  1970-1980s  [10,  11],  confirmed  the 
data  of  Pokhil  about  significant  scale  of  the  dispersion  of  DB  propellants  in  vacuum,  but  they  re¬ 
futed  hypothesis  about  maintaining  dispersion  degree  by  approximately  the  same  level  with  the 
pressure  increase. 

According  to  the  results  of  [10,  11],  during  the  combustion  of  DB  propellants  the  degree  of  dis¬ 
persion  with  an  increase  in  the  pressure  is  monotonically  reduced  from  30-40%  at  pressure  p<3 
mm  Hg  to  the  values,  which  do  not  exceed  several  percents  with  p=0.5  atm.  Simultaneously  the 
burning  rate  is  increased  by  3-5  times  (at  the  same  initial  temperature). 

The  question  arises:  does  observed  increase  in  the  burning  rate  correspond  to  increase  in  the 
thermal  effect  of  the  condensed  phase  decomposition  Q  as  a  result  of  reduction  of  a  dispersion 
degree?  Let  us  examine  this  problem  in  more  detail  on  the  example  of  combustion  of  DB  propel¬ 
lant  N  (55%  nitrocellulose,  26%  nitroglycerin,  13%  dinitrotoluene,  6%  additives). 


Let  us  designate  as  degree  of  dispersion  the  ratio  of  the  mass,  which  left  from  the  burning  surface 
in  dispersed  state,  to  total  consumed  mass  of  EM  for  the  same  time  interval.  The  decrease  of  the 
dispersion  degree  for  the  propellant  N  from  r|d  ~  0.35  at  p  <  3  mm  Hg  to  rjd  ~  0  at  p  =  400  mn  Hg 
is  accompanied  by  an  approximately  three-fold  increase  in  the  burning  rate  (at  To=120  C).  If  we 
do  not  consider  the  specific  behavior  of  the  volatile  components  in  the  combustion  wave  of  DB 
propellant  (nitroglycerin  -  NGL,  and  dinitrotoluene  -  DNT),  then  observed  decrease  rid  must  lead 
to  increase  Ts  by  value  ATS  ~  0.3  Qc/c  >100  K.  Mass  burning  rate  m  with  this  increase  of  Ts  must 
be  increased  at  least  by  an  order  of  magnitude,  since  m  ~exp(-E/RTs)  and  E-20000  cal/mol  [12]. 

In  works  [10,14]  it  has  been  shown  that  significant  role  in  the  balance  of  heat  for  condensed 
phase  of  propellant  N  play  volatile  components  of  the  propellant:  NGL  and  DNT.  Indeed,  the 
balance  energy  for  the  burning  surface  has  the  form: 

c(l-a)(Ts-T0)  +  ca(Tb-T0)  +  aL+caWb  =(l-a)Qcrj’s  (2.34) 

Here  a,  Tb,  L  -  mass  fraction  of  volatile  components  in  the  propellant  formulation  correspond¬ 
ingly,  their  boiling  temperature  and  heat  of  vaporization  (Tc  and  L  for  NGL  and  DNT  are  ap¬ 
proximately  equal,  according  to  [15]);r|s'  =  l-r|s/(l-a)  -  extent  of  the  decomposition  of  nonvola¬ 
tile  component  (nitrocellulose). 

The  terms  in  (2.34)  reflect  the  expenditures  of  heat,  liberated  upon  decomposition  of  (l-a)Tis' 
portion  of  propellant,  for  heating  of  nonvolatile  component  from  To  to  Ts  plus  heating  of  volatile 
components  to  Tb,  their  subsequent  vaporization  and  warm-up  of  the  vapors  by  ATb  during  their 
escape  from  condensed  phase. 


Assuming,  according  to  rough  estimates,  that  acATb/(l-a)QcT|s«l  (as  a  result  of  small  magni¬ 
tude  of  ATC  since  vapors  of  volatile  components  during  the  escape  produce  channels  in  a  reaction 
layer  of  condensed  phase  and  residence  time  of  vapors  there  so  little  that  the  warm-up  does  not 
exceed  value  ATb  ~  30°C  [10]),  we  will  obtain  for  the  low  pressures  (p«l  atm): 

t,  =r0+^£--2----^-(7;-r0)  (2.35) 

c  1  -a c  1  -a 

From  (2.35),  it  is  evident  that  Ts  depends  not  only  on  the  degree  of  dispersion,  but  also  on  the 
boiling  point  of  volatile  components  Tb.  Since  with  an  increase  in  pressure  Tb  is  increased,  heat 
expenditures  for  volatile  components  heating  are  also  increased.  This  restricts  strong  increase  of 
Ts  and,  consequently,  of  the  burning  rate. 


At  pressures  where  spatially  divided  fronts  of  gasification  (vaporization  and  decomposition)  ex¬ 
ist,  propagation  of  the  combustion  wave  in  the  coordinate  system,  connected  with  the  burning 
surface,  can  be  described  by  the  system  of  equations: 

Xd2T/dx2 -(l-a)cmdT/dx  +  (l-a)Qc(S>  =  0  (2.36) 

mdr\/dx  +  <&  =  0,  <I>  =pcf(r))k0exp(-E/RT),  x<0,  a<l  (2.37) 

Here  X  -  thermal  conductivity;  ko,  E  and  f(q)  -  pre-exponent,  energy  of  activation,  and  kinetic 
function,  correspondingly. 

The  terms,  connected  with  the  heat  expenditures  for  heating  and  vaporization  of  volatile  compo¬ 
nents,  are  not  included  in  (2.36).  The  possibility  of  such  treatment  is  ensured  by  the  fact  that  the 


2—75 


front  of  vaporization  plays  “external”  role  with  respect  to  the  zone  of  chemical  reactions  and  the 
presence  of  volatile  components  is  taken  into  account  under  the  boundary  condition  at  the  “cold” 
end: 

X  — >  -°°,  t|/  — >  0,  T-»T0*;  x  =  0,-n  =  Tis',  dT/dx  =  0. 

Integration  of  (2.36),  with  taking  into  account  of  (2.37)  and  boundary  conditions,  gives  relation¬ 
ship  Ts  =  To*+Qcr|s7c,  which  coincides  with  (2.35)  when 

T0*  =  T0-a(Tc-T0**)/(l-a),  T0**  =  T0  -  L/c 

Solution  of  the  system  (2.36),  (2.37)  under  assumptions  of  Zeldovich  -  Franck-Kamenetskii  takes 
the  form  (with  f(r|)  =  1) 

m2  =  2Xpc(  RT2 /E)k0exp(-E/RTs)/r\,2(\-a)Qc.  (2.38) 

For  closing  the  problem  it  is  necessary  to  know  dependence  of  r|s'  on  internal  and  external  pa¬ 
rameters  of  combustion.  It  is  most  simple  to  use  empirical  dependence  [10]  r\s'  =  \]s\  -  B5b  , 
where  6b  -  distance  between  the  fronts  of  gasification  which  are  caused  by  chemical  reaction  and 
vaporization;  B  -  empirical  constant;  r|si  -  degree  of  conversion  at  Tb  =  Ts.  At  p>pi,  when  ine¬ 
quality  |  Ts-Tb  |  <  RTs2/E  starts  to  held,  the  value  of  qs'  is  assumed  constant  and  equal  to  Tisi. 

By  expressing  8b  through  m,  Ts,  Tb  and  T0  the  relationship  for  r|s'  can  be  written  in  the  form 

rj'^rj^-iBA/crnXl-a^m^-T^/iT.-T;)]  (2.39) 

Equations  (2.38)  and  (2.35),  taking  into  account  (2.39)  and  dependence  Tb(p)  in  the  form  of  Clau- 
sius-Clapeyron  equation 

Tb  =  L/Rln(po/p),  po  =  const 
compose  algebraic  system  for  finding  m,  Ts  and  ti/. 

Dependencies  of  the  burning  rate  on  To  and  p  take  the  form 

v  =  {E/2L)(Tb/Tsf,  fi  =  E/2RT2.  (2.40) 

Form  of  expressions  for  (3  and  v  is  similar  to  those  known  from  literature.  However,  the  depend¬ 
ence  on  the  pressure  is  the  specific  feature  of  the  expression  for  v.  This  is  because  of  dependence 
Tb  =  Tb(p).  With  the  decrease  in  pressure  Tb  is  reduced  more  rapidly  than  Ts  and  dependence 
m(p),  according  to  (1.84),  weakens.  This  character  of  behavior  of  v  corresponds  to  experiments 
[1]. 

For  DB  propellant  N  satisfactory  agreement  with  the  experiment  is  observed  if  one  takes  E  =  L  = 
20000  cal/mol.  In  this  case  (3  =  2.5- 10'2  K"1  -  experiment  (pel  atm),  and  (3  =  2-10'2  K'1  -  calcula¬ 
tion,  v  =  0.3-S-0.4  -  experiment  (p  <  10'1  atm),  and  v  =  0.3  -  calculation,  v  =  0.6  -  experiment  (10' 
'<p<l  atm),  and  v  =  0.5  -  calculation.  Thus,  the  used  form  of  heat  balance  on  the  burning  surface 
(1.78)  allows  even  in  the  case  of  a  significant  variation  in  the  degree  of  dispersion  to  correlate  the 
calculated  and  experimental  dependencies  u(p,To). 


2.7.1  Combustion  model  with  variable  heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase. 

Numerous  investigations  [1,  5,  6]  testify  that  during  burning  of  nitrocellulose  (NC)  and  powders 
on  its  basis  the  heat  release  Qc  in  the  condensed  phase  depends  on  p  and  To.  This  fact  was  usually 
explained  by  assuming  the  dispersion  of  the  certain  fraction  of  condensed  phase  T)d  into  the 


2—76 


smoke-gas  zone,  so  that  Qc  =  Qo  (1-Tld),  where  Q0=const  -  heat  evolution  with  the  complete  gasifi¬ 
cation  of  the  condensed  phase,  a  r|d  is  expressed  in  the  form  of  a  certain  function  of  Ts  and  p  [14]. 
However,  for  the  pressures  of  p  >  1  atm  the  concept  about  the  determining  effect  of  the  disper¬ 
sion  degree  on  the  value  of  Qc  contradicts  experiment  [10, 11]. 


Let  us  examine  simple  model  of  reaction  zone  of  the  condensed  phase  of  DB  propellants,  ex¬ 
plaining  variability  of  Qc  without  use  of  the  dispersion  concept.  It  is  known  that  the  first  elemen¬ 
tary  act  of  the  thermal  decomposition  of  nitroesters  is  the  endothermal  breaking  CO-NO2  bond 
with  the  formation  of  two  free  radicals:  the  dioxide  of  nitrogen  and  alcoxyl  radical  [12,  16], 
which  then  enter  into  the  secondary  chemical  oxidation  reactions.  On  the  basis  of  the  concept  of 
the  multi  stage  chemical  transformation  in  the  combustion  of  propellants  based  on  NC,  A.  A. 
Zenin  assumed  [12]  that  a  large  difference  in  the  kinetic  constants  of  the  decomposition  of  DB 
propellants,  obtained  under  conditions  of  low-temperature  thermolysis  and  during  the  burning, 
can  be  explained  by  the  change  of  the  rate  control  stage.  However,  it  is  obvious  that  the  change  of 
the  rate  control  stage  must  not  lead  within  the  frame vork  of  model  [12],  to  a  change  in  summary 
thermal  effect  Qc.  One  may  expect  that  during  the  decomposition  of  such  complex  chemical 
compounds  as  NC  and  NGL,  following  the  first  stage  (breakaway  of  N02-groups)  another  set  of 
series-parallel  reactions  is  realized.  Let  us  divide  conditionally  all  this  set  into  two  parallel  global 
competing  reactions  with  different  thermal  effects  Q2  and  Q3  (for  the  certainty  let  us  assume 
Q3>Q,).  Schematically,  the  way  of  transforming  the  initial  propellant  A  into  the  reaction  gaseous 
products  Pi  and  P2  can  be  represented  in  the  form  [17] 

K2,  Q2,  l-Tls 


K3>  Q3>  11s

(2.41) 

Here  Kj  (i  =  1,  2,  3)  -  rate  constant  of  the  corresponding  stage  of  decomposition;  B  -  intermediate 
product  (denitrated  propellant  with  dissolved  N02);  r\s  -  fraction  of  the  product  B,  which  reacts 
by  the  most  calorific  way  with  the  thermal  effect  Q3 . 


Total  thermal  effect  Qc  in  this  case  is  determined  by  the  shared  contribution  of  different  reactions 
in  the  decomposition  of  propellant  to  the  gaseous  products 

Qc  =  Qi  +  Q2(l-tls)+  QsTIs  (2.42) 

Here  Qi  -  thermal  effect  of  the  breakaway  of  N02-groups  per  unit  mass  of  initial  propellant.  Ac¬ 
cording  to  analysis  of  Zenin  [12],  stages  A— »B  and  B— >P  in  the  combustion  wave  at  moderate 
pressures  are  spatially  divided,  so  that  the  reactions  B->P  start  after  the  virtually  entire  comple¬ 
tion  of  the  first  stage  of  decomposition.  Taking  this  into  account,  the  degree  of  conversion  in  the 
first  stage  is  accepted  in  (1.86)  equal  to  1.  The  summary  exothermic  character  of  the  decomposi¬ 
tion  of  DB  propellant  is  determined  by  secondary  condensed  phase  reactions  with  participation  of 
N02  [1].  This  is  testified  by  the  facts  that  the  maximum  thermal  effect  of  the  thermal  decomposi¬ 
tion  corresponds  to  the  minimum  yield  of  N02  into  gaseous  products  [16],  and  increase  Qc  with 
increase  in  pressure  is  accompanied  by  decrease  in  the  content  of  N02  in  reaction  products  [1]. 

Indirect  data,  which  testify  for  important  role  of  secondary  condensed  phase  reactions  with  par¬ 
ticipation  of  intermediate  volatile  product,  are  obtained  also  in  the  work  [18].  In  experiments  on 
the  high-temperature  pulse  calorimetry  it  was  revealed  that  the  specific  heat  release  rates  in  the 
thick  (12-13  |am)  films  of  NC  are  higher  than  in  the  thin  (<3  pm)  ones.  Within  the  framework  of 


2—77 


the  concepts  developed  this  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  diffusion  of  NO2  from  the  thick  NC 
films  is  hindered;  therefore,  secondary  reactions  run  more  effectively.  The  possible  important 
role  of  the  diffusion  of  volatile  intermediate  products  upon  decay  of  nitro-compounds  was  also 
indicated  by  K.  K.  Andreev  when  he  analyzed  the  values  of  the  kinetic  constants  [19]. 

Let  us  assume  that  the  efficiency  (depletion  degree)  of  reacting  in  stage  with  the  thermal  effect  of 
Q3  is  determined  by  the  intensity  of  N02  participation  in  secondary  processes  in  the  condensed 
phase.  Reaction  with  the  thermal  effect  of  Q2  in  that  case  will  be  the  decomposition  of  the  deni¬ 
trated  product.  During  the  burning  the  degrees  of  decomposition  in  terms  of  each  of  the  ways  will 
be  determined  by  the  probability  of  the  N02  involvement  into  the  secondary  reactions.  This 
probability  depends  on  the  conditions  of  the  deletion  of  the  molecules  N02  from  the  reaction 
zone,  i.e.,  from  the  rates  of  diffusion  and  filtration  of  macro-quantities  of  N02. 

Thus,  the  probability  of  reaction  for  N02  will  be  determined  by  the  width  of  the  reaction  zone  8, 
by  the  coefficient  of  diffusion  D,  by  the  linear  burning  rate  u,  and  the  fraction  of  the  molecules 
N02,  which  are  found  in  the  dissolved  state,  C/Co  (where  Co  and  C  are  the  concentrations  of  N02 
in  the  initial  propellant  and  in  the  liquefied  reaction  layer).  Since  the  probability  of  the  secondary 
reaction  with  the  participation  of  N02  linearly  depends  on  the  degree  of  decomposition  in  terms  of 
the  stage  with  effect  of  Q3,  it  is  possible  to  write  r|s=  ris(C/C0,  D,  8,  u,  K3).  From  dimensionality 
considerations  one  obtains 

Tis  =Z(C/C0)n'(ud/D)'h(K352/Dp  =£VV%"3-  (2.43) 

Exponents  ni,  n2  and  n3  need  the  independent  determination.  Assuming  the  order  of  the  reaction 
on  concentration  of  N02  being  equal  to  unity  [12],  we  immediately  obtain  m  =  1.  Considering  the 
species  of  N02,  entering  the  chemical  reaction,  equiprobable  throughout  entire  zone  8,  we  may 
assume  %  ~  8/ld,  where  ld  -  characteristic  diffusion  length.  But  8/ld  =  8/(D8/u)1/2  =  Jt21/2,  hence, 
n2=0.5.  Complex  Jt3  presents  the  square  of  the  ratio  of  the  characteristic  rates  for  the  chemical 
reaction  and  diffusion.  Since  the  yield  of  two  competing  processes  is  proportional  to  the  first  de¬ 
gree  of  the  ratio  of  the  rate  constants  for  these  processes,  n3  =  0.5.  Taking  further  into  account 
that  K3=u/8,  we  obtain  that  7i3  =  7t2  and  relationship  (2.43)  takes  the  form 

r|  s  =Z)’(C/C0  )(«8  /  D),  =  const.  (2.44) 

Taking  into  account  that  8  ~  Ts2/u(Ts-T0),  and  D  -  Ts/|x  and  \x  ~  exp(E'/RTs) ,  we  derive  finally 

=  hpTs  exp(E’/ RTS)/(TS  -T0),  £,  =  const  (2.45) 

When  deriving  (2.45),  it  was  assumed  that  the  heat  of  N02  solution  is  close  to  zero,  and  solubility 
is  proportional  to  pressure,  i.e.,  C  ~  p. 

Introduction  of  the  degree  of  decomposition  in  the  form  of  (2.44)  does  not  make  essential  com¬ 
plications  in  mathematical  description  of  DB  propellant  combustion.  The  propagation  of  the 
combustion  wave  is  formally  described  by  the  ordinary  system  of  equations  for  the  rate  control 
reaction  stage  in  the  condensed  phase  with  incomplete  transformation  of  solid  substance  into  the 
gas  on  the  surface.  This  will  only  imply  the  replacement  of  complex  Q0  X)s'  by  Qc  (r(s)  according 
to  (2.42)  and  (2.44).  Here  Q0=const  -  thermal  effect  of  the  decomposition  of  condensed  phase;  r\s' 
=l-r|d  =  f  (p,To,u)  -  degree  of  conversion  of  condensed  phase  into  the  gas  on  the  surface. 

Expression  for  the  burning  rate  u  now  takes  the  form  [20] 


2—78 


u2  ~  T2  exp(  -E3  /RTs)/ Q]  (2.46) 

Energies  of  activation  of  both  simultaneous  reactions  B  — » Pi  and  B  — >  P2  seem  to  be  close.  Thus, 
for  the  oxidative  reactions  with  participation  of  NO2,  value  E  =  19000  cal/mol  [12],  and  for  the 
decomposition  of  pure  cellulose  in  the  range  of  temperatures  260  to  310  °C  E2  =  14000-26000 
cal/mol  [21]. 

The  comparison  with  experiment  for  DB  propellant  N  can  be  performed  by  examination  the  fol¬ 
lowing  dependencies:  Qc(To.),  Qc(p),  u(To)  and  u(p). 

a)  The  dependence  Qc(To)  can  be  found  by  differentiating  expression  (2.42)  on  To  taking  into  ac¬ 
count  (2.44)  and  condition  Ts  =  To+Qc/c: 

30, /3T0  =  c(l - E’/ RTS )/[cT,  -Ql)+E’/RT,  +T0  /(T,  -rj  (2.47) 

The  value  of  E’  for  pure  NC  is  about  28000  cal/mol  [22],  And  though  in  the  course  of  the  propel¬ 
lant  destruction  in  the  wave  of  combustion  the  value  of  E’,  apparently,  is  changed,  one  may  ex¬ 
pect  the  retention  of  E’  value  on  the  sufficiently  high  level,  such  that  E’/RTS  »1.  In  this  case,  as 
can  be  seen  from  (2.46),  3Qc/3To<0. 

Let  us  evaluate  the  magnitudes  of  thermal  effects  Qi,  Q2  and  Q3.  Greatest  thermal  effect  Qc,max  is 
realized  when  r|s.=  1.  From  (2.42)  it  follows  that  QCimax  =  Qi  +  Q3  •  Computed  value  of  Qi  ob¬ 
tained  by  the  summation  of  energies  of  CO-NO2  bonds  in  the  propellant  N,  is  approximately 
equal  to  -400  cal/g,  and  Qc,max  =  800  cal/g  [16],  then  Q3  =  1200  cal/g.  If  denitrated  NC  does  not 
essentially  differ  from  regular  cellulose,  the  value  of  Q2  seems  to  be  close  to  zero  [23].  Degree  of 
conversion  r\s  =  (Qc-  QO/Q3  =  [c(Ts-To)-Qi]/Q3  with  p>l  atm  is  close  to  0.5.  Then  it  is  fulfilled 

dQc  /  dT0  ~  -c.  (2.48) 

With  increase  in  T0,  as  it  follows  from  analysis  of  (2.48),  the  value  of  Qc  is  reduced.  Physically 
this  means  that  an  increase  in  To,  which  simultaneously  leads  to  increasing  Ts,  leads  to  an  in¬ 
crease  in  the  diffusion  removal  of  the  molecules  of  N02  from  condensed  to  the  gas  phase  (D  ~ 
Ts/p).  This  is  reflected  by  decrease  in  r|s. 

b)  The  dependence  Qc(p)  is  determined  by  differentiating  expressions  (1.86)  and  (1.88)  on  p  tak¬ 
ing  into  account  relationship  Ts  =  T0+  Qc/c.  Eliminating  derivatives  on  r\s  and  Ts,we  obtain 

3 Q,/blnp  =  (0,  -0,k[l  +  (e, -Q1KE’/cRT?Y-  (2-4« 

Then,  assuming  (E’/RTS)(Q3-Q2)  r|s/cTs»l,  we  obtain 

dQc  /  din  p  =  cRT2  / E\  (2.50) 

Figure  2.10  gives  diagram  of  dependence  QC(T0)  constructed  according  to  expression  (2.47).  The 
heat  capacity  of  propellant  is  taken  average  in  the  range  of  To  from  -200  to  100°C;  E’  is  assumed 
equal  to  12500  cal/mol.  In  the  same  figure  the  experimental  data  Qc(To)  [5,  6,  24,  25]  are  plotted. 
Figure  2.11  shows  the  dependence  Qc(p)  calculated  by  (2.49).  The  experimental  data  [5,  6,  24, 
25]  are  depicted  by  circles. 

c)  Using  (2.46)  with  the  same  approximations  we  obtain  temperature  sensitivity  of  the  burning 
rate 

(3  =  3 In u /dT0  =  {Ts  - T0)'1  (l  +  E/E’). 

d)  Similarity,  the  burning  rate  pressure  sensitivity  is  expressed  by

Thus,  the  model  proposed  describes  with  reasonable  accuracy  the  basic  burning  laws  of  DB  pro¬ 
pellant  over  a  wide  range  of  the  burning  conditions.

2.7.2.  Effect  of  the  initial  temperature  on  the  burning  rate. 

The  question  about  causes  strengthening  the  dependence  of  the  burning  rate  of  DB  propellant  N 
on  initial  temperature  was  repeatedly  discussed  in  the  literature  [24,  26,  27]. 

According  to  experimental  data  [24],  the  burning  rate  temperature  coefficient  P=3lnu/dTo  at  pres¬ 
sure  20  atm  increases  from  -0.5T0'3  K'1  at  To  =  -150  °C  to  15-10'3  K'1  at  To=  140°C.  Similar  pat¬ 
tern  is  observed  at  other  pressures.  It  is  also  shown  [24]  that  the  dependence  of  the  burning  sur¬ 
face  temperature  Ts  on  To  is  strengthened  with  increase  of  To.  Thus,  the  value  of  derivative  r  = 
9TS  /  0To  at  p  =  20  atm  varies  from  ~0.2  at  To  =  (-100,  -150)°  C  to  ~  0.5  at  To  =  (100,  140)°C.  The 
variation  of  r  at  p=l  atm  is  still  stronger:  from  0.1  at  To  =  (-100,  -200)°  C  to  1.0  at  To  =  (50, 
100)°C. 

The  concept  of  unique  dependence  u(Ts)  [25]  gives  possibility  to  reduce  the  problem  on  the  rea¬ 
sons  for  strengthening  dependence  u(To)  to  the  analysis  of  dependence  Ts(To).  Further,  the  use  of 
a  heat  balance  in  the  form 

c(r.-r0)  =  et  =  S  a  (2-51) 

reduces  the  problem  to  the  analysis  of  dependence  Qc(To).  Here  c  -  average  over  the  temperature 
range  (To,  Ts)  specific  heat  of  the  propellant;  SQi  =  QCh  +  Qth  +  Qr  +  Qait  -  amount  of  heat  re¬ 
quired  for  the  warm-up  of  the  unit  of  the  propellant  mass  from  To  to  Ts;  QCh  -  heat  released  during 
the  chemical  decomposition  of  the  condensed  phase;  (Qth  +  Qr)  -  heat  feedback  to  the  condensed 
phase  via  the  thermal  conductivity  from  gas  (Qth)  and  the  radiation  from  flame  (Qr);  Qait  -  other 


2—80 


possible  (or  alternative)  heat  sources  or  sinks.  Relationship  (2.51)  is  formulated  for  the  unit  of 
propellant  mass  and  it  is  accurate  in  the  absence  of  dispersion,  i.e.,  it  has  to  be  considered  at  p>l 
atm. 

In  Ref.  [24]  the  data  are  cited  on  heat  evolution  (QCh+Qth)  =  Q'c  in  the  condensed  phase  of  DB 
propellant  N,  calculated  from  the  difference  in  heat  fluxes  Aq  on  the  boundaries  of  chemical  re¬ 
action  zone:  (QCh+Qth)=Aq/pcu.  The  account  of  the  fact  that  for  non-metallized  propellant  the 
contribution  of  Qr  to  the  value  of  EQj  is  relatively  low  (Qr  «  Qch+Qth  [5,  28]  )  gives  the  possi¬ 
bility  to  evaluate  the  contribution  of  Qait  via  the  comparison  of  values  c  (Ts-To)  and  (Qch+Qth)- 
Note  that  c  (Ts-  To)  and  (Qch+Qth)  are  determined  in  an  independent  manner. 

Table  2.13  presents  the  values  of  (Qch+Qth)  calculated  according  to  the  experimental  data  [24]  in 
dependence  on  To.  There  are  also  presented  data  on  c  (Ts  -  To)  calculated  with  use  of  (2.51)  ac¬ 
cording  to  experimental  data  Ts(To)  at  p  =  20  atm  and  c  =0.3  cal/(g  K)  for  propellant  N.  The 
magnitude  of  c  is  taken  as  average  value  of  the  heat  capacity  of  DB  propellant  N  in  the  investi¬ 
gated  temperature  range  (-200,  -150)°C  according  to  the  data  [28-31].

It  follows  from  Table  2.13  that  the  values  of  heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase  of  propellant, 
calculated  by  (2.51),  can  be  correlated  with  those  directly  measured  only  if  one  assumes  an  exis¬ 
tence  of  some  endothermal  process  with  thermal  effect  Qau,  which  depends  on  To  in  accordance 
with  reported  data. 

What  is  the  nature  of  this  effect?  According  to  Ref.  [28],  essential  role  in  the  combustion  of  dou¬ 
ble  base  propellant  N  may  play  irreversible  exothermic  “low  temperature  reactions”.  Indeed,  if 
one  choose  proper  value  of  c  in  expression  (2.51),  the  values  of  Qc  =  c  (Ts-To)  and  Qc  =  QCh  + 
Qth  can  become  equal  at  low  temperatures  and  one  receives  Qait  >  0  at  elevated  temperatures. 
However,  this  is  not  consistent  with  observed  in  [28]  combustion  behavior  of  thermally  treated 
propellant  N.  Actually,  the  burning  rate  of  propellant  N,  which  was  preliminary  heated  during  1 
hour  under  temperature  130°C,  exhibits  increased  by  7-12%  value  at  the  temperature  20°C  as 
compared  with  fresh  propellant.  This  contradicts  hypothesis  on  essential  contribution  of  “low 
temperature”  exothermic  reactions  in  observed  dependence  u(To)  upon  assumption  on  the  rate 
control  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase.  In  scope  of  this  approach  one  may  expect  only  decrease 
in  the  burning  rate  because  of  reduction  by  approximately  26  cal/g  [28]  of  summary  heat  release 
in  the  condensed  phase. 

Investigations  carried  out  for  the  mixture  of  nitrocellulose  and  nitroglycerin  [33],  showed  that 
this  mixture  is  limitedly  compatible  and  presents  true  solution  only  within  certain  ranges  in  com¬ 
position  and  temperature.  The  warm-up  of  the  mixture  NC  and  NGL  above  the  so-called  lower 


2—81 


critical  mixing  temperature  (LCMT)  leads  to  the  separation  of  the  system  into  two  different 
phases,  one  of  which  is  depleted  by  NG,  and  the  other  -  by  NGL.  There  are  also  several  proofs  of 
the  existence  of  the  components  separation  effect  for  the  propellant  N,  which  contains  NC  and 
NGL  as  the  basic  components.  Since  the  lamination  is  accompanied  by  a  change  in  a  number  of 
properties  of  the  propellant,  it  is  of  interest  to  examine  its  effect  on  the  combustion  law  parame¬ 
ters. 

Let  us  point  out  initially  the  facts,  which  testify  about  possibility  of  components  separation  in  DB 
propellant  N  during  heating,  and  estimate  the  value  of  LCMT.  Extrapolation  of  data  [33]  into  the 
domain  of  the  composition,  which  corresponds  to  formulation  of  propellant  N,  gives  the  value  of 
LCMT  about  60-90  °C.  Since  the  process  of  plastification  of  NC  by  nitroglycerin  proceeds  with 
the  heat  liberation  [34],  reverse  process  (separation)  must  be  accompanied  by  the  heat  absorption. 
For  the  propellant  N  this  is  marked,  in  particular,  by  a  sharp  increase  of  heat  capacity  when  in¬ 
creasing  the  ambient  temperature  above  60°C:  from  0.35  cal/(g.K)  at  60°C  to  0.5  at  92°C  [31].  It 
is  necessary  to  note  that  the  thermal  effect  of  separation  depends  on  the  depth  of  penetration  into 
the  domain  of  incompatibility,  so  that  the  effect  can  be  "smeared”  in  the  wide  range  of  tempera¬ 
tures  higher  than  LCMT.  This  serves  as  obstacle  to  the  detection  of  effect  in  experiments  on 
thermal  analysis.  Besides,  with  an  increase  in  the  temperature  the  masking  effect  of  exothermic 
decomposition  reactions  begins  to  develop. 

Hysteresis  of  structural  and  thermodynamic  properties  of  system  upon  heating  and  cooling  serves 
as  one  of  distinctive  manifestations  of  a  separation.  As  has  already  been  indicated,  the  prelimi¬ 
nary  heating  of  DB  propellant  N  at  130°C  for  1  hour  (with  subsequent  cooling)  leads  to  an  in¬ 
crease  in  its  burning  rate  by  7  to  11%  at  1  atm  and  20  °C.  Within  the  framework  of  the  approach 
under  discussion  this  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  when  the  propellant  was  kept  for  a  long 
time  at  the  temperature  above  LCMT  its  components  were  separated  rather  effectively.  When 
cooling  in  a  relatively  short  time,  a  slow  solvation  process  may  not  be  completed  entirely  and  the 
combustion  proceeds  with  an  enhanced  rate  because  there  is  no  need  to  spend  heat  for  total 
desolvation  of  components. 

Since  the  process  of  separation  at  To>  LCMT  proceeds  essentially  by  diffusion  way,  one  may  ex¬ 
pect  that  the  burning  rates  will  differ  in  samples  heated  different  time.  Usually  the  warm-up  time 
to  the  required  To  takes  tens  of  minutes.  If  the  process  of  separation  in  the  sample  for  this  time 
takes  place  at  the  sufficient  degree,  it  is  possible  to  expect  also  increase  in  the  burning  rate  of  this 
sample  in  comparison  with  the  sample,  whose  warm-up  to  the  same  temperature  proceeds  rap¬ 
idly.  For  example,  it  can  be  done  via  absorption  of  radiant  energy  from  the  external  source  in  the 
process  of  combustion.  It  has  been  shown  [28]  that  the  rates  of  combustion  of  samples  under  the 
effect  of  radiant  flux  of  known  density  are  lower  than  the  rate  of  combustion  of  the  samples, 
warmed  up  to  equivalent  initial  temperatures  estimated  by  the  known  relations  (see,  for  example, 
[35]  ).  Disagreement  between  burning  rates  begins  to  noticeably  exceed  an  experimental  error 
with  heat  flux  qr  >  3  cal/(cm2s),  which  corresponds  to  the  effective  initial  temperature  To  >  60  °C, 
which  is  close  to  the  estimated  value  of  LCMT.  Values  of  the  burning  rate  temperature  sensitivity 
coefficient  P  =  dlnu/dTo  corresponding  certain  value  of  the  burning  rate  reached  by  different 
ways,  due  to  variation  of  a  initial  temperature  u(To)  in  one  case  and  due  to  variation  of  a  radiant 
flux  u(qr)  in  other  case,  may  also  differ  at  Tq>LCMT

CHAPTER  3 

STATIONARY  COMBUSTION  OF  UNIMODAL  HETEROGENEOUS  CONDENSED 
SYSTEMS 


3.1.  INTRODUCTORY  REMARKS 

Heterogeneous  condensed  systems,  as  it  follows  from  the  name,  have  three-dimensional  non- 
homogeneous  physical  structure  and  consist  of  different  chemical  components.  As  typical  repre¬ 
sentatives  of  such  systems  serve  the  solid  rocket  propellants,  in  which  the  particles  of  powder- 
like  filler  (oxidizer,  additives  of  explosives  and  metallic  fuel,  catalyst,  etc.)  are  distributed  in  the 
matrix  of  binder  performing  also  the  role  of  fuel.  It  is  necessary  to  note  that  the  division  of  solid 
propellants  (SP)  into  the  homogeneous  and  the  heterogeneous  to  the  certain  degree  is  conditional. 
It  depends  on  the  ratio  of  the  scales  of  the  zones  of  chemical  reaction  to  the  size  and  mixing 
lengths  of  components  and  can  vary  with  a  variation  in  the  ambient  conditions  and  the  burning 
rate  value. 

Components  of  heterogeneous  SP,  besides  their  direct  functional  designation,  can  be  classified 
according  to  their  capability  for  self  sustaining  combustion.  On  the  burning  surface  of  SP  the  in¬ 
ert  type  components,  not  capable  of  burning  independently,  are  gasified  under  the  effect  of  the 
heat  flux,  which  enters  from  the  flame.  The  combustion  of  the  particles  of  active  components 
(some  types  of  oxidizers,  additives  of  explosives,  some  types  of  bonding  agent)  proceeds  under 
the  conditions  of  the  effect  of  additional  heat  flux  from  the  distant  zones  of  the  SP  flame.  Simul¬ 
taneously,  an  interaction  due  to  the  mixing  and  the  heat  transfer  with  other  propellant  components 
occurs.  As  a  result  the  burning  rate  of  active  energetic  component  in  the  SP  formulation  can 
prove  to  be  either  higher  or  lower  than  the  rate  of  its  independent  combustion. 

From  theoretical  point  of  view  the  process  of  combustion  of  heterogeneous  SP  depends  not  only 
on  thermophysical  and  kinetic  factors,  but  also  on  diffusion  that  characterizes  efficiency  of  mix¬ 
ing  the  reagents,  which  enter  the  reaction  zones.  Among  the  parameters  that  determine  the  com¬ 
bustion  laws  an  effective  size  of  the  particles  of  the  filler  appears,  and  more  accurately  -  a  func¬ 
tion  of  mass  size  distribution  for  filler  particles. 

Essential  line  of  the  physical  picture  of  heterogeneous  SP  combustion  is  heterogeneity  and  con¬ 
nected  with  it  transience  of  the  components  transformation  on  the  burning  surface.  This  is  caused 
by  essential  difference  in  the  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  SP  components  and  by  the  pres¬ 
ence  of  different  states  of  the  substance  interfaces.  The  wealth  of  the  forms  of  transformations 
and  physical  states  of  components  in  the  combustion  wave  does  not  make  it  possible  to  construct 
the  universal  description  of  the  process  of  SP  combustion.  Therefore,  a  more  realistic  way  con¬ 
sists  in  the  choosing  the  limiting  or  extreme  cases  and  elaborating  the  models,  which  work  in  the 
limited  range  of  the  parameters  variation.  Note  that  the  discussion  deals  first  of  all  with  analytical 
type  models,  where  it  is  necessary  to  sufficiently  strongly  simplify  the  description  of  phenome¬ 
non  in  order  to  obtain  approximate  solution. 

As  natural  limiting  cases  there  emerge  versions  of  the  models  with  very  fine  and  very  coarse 
grains  of  filler  (kinetic  and  diffusion  combustion  behavior  according  to  terminology  introduced 


3—1 


by  N.  N.  Bakhman  [1]).  In  the  first  case  components  manage  to  mix  before  entering  the  chemical 
reactions  (quasi-homogeneous  models);  the  second  case  corresponds  to  situation,  when  the  size 
of  grain  exceeds  the  thickness  of  preheated  layer.  In  the  last  case  the  correct  account  of  diffusion 
and  accurate  determination  of  the  components  concentration  on  the  burning  surface  are  impor¬ 
tant.  For  the  grains  of  intermediate  size,  compared  with  the  thickness  of  the  preheated  layer,  the 
models  are  developed  using  different  methods  for  averaging  the  heterogeneity  of  the  thermal  and 
diffusion  wave  structure  both  on  the  surface  of  the  condensed  phase  and  in  the  flame.  In  these 
models  the  averaging  is  performed  either  over  the  geometric  surface  of  the  burning  SP  (spatial 
averaging)  or  over  sufficiently  prolonged  time  interval  during  the  combustion  front  propagation 
into  the  bulk  of  propellant  along  the  chosen  normal  direction  (time  averaging). 

3.2.  QUASI-HOMOGENEOUS  SYSTEMS 

We  will  call  quasi-homogeneous  such  models,  in  which  heterogeneity  does  not  affect  processes 
essential  for  combustion,  so  that  the  burning  rate  can  be  calculated  using  relationships  for  homo¬ 
geneous  models.  Nevertheless  the  preceding  stages  may  "feel”  the  mentioned  heterogeneity.  For 
example,  typical  SP  based  on  AP  at  a  sufficiently  low  pressure  has  the  rate  control  stage  in  the 
gaseous  flame  (at  low  pressures  AP,  as  it  was  noted  in  Chapter  2,  can  not  independently  bum). 
Gas  flame  at  a  low  pressure  is  considerably  distant  from  the  surface,  and  reactions  in  it  proceed  in 
the  kinetic  regime  (combustion  of  the  premixed  gas),  hence,  heterogeneity  of  SP  here  in  no  way 
is  manifested.  However,  in  this  case  the  SP  heterogeneity  leads  to  non-uniform  character  of  ther¬ 
mal  and  other  physicochemical  processes  in  a  layer  of  the  condensed  phase  with  the  thickness  of 
the  order  of  AP  particle  size. 

3.2.1.  Compositions  with  perfectly  mixed  components  on  the  surface 

It  is  known  that  many  of  utilized  in  SP  components  are  present  on  the  burning  surface  in  the 
melted  form.  If  both  the  oxidizer  and  binder  are  melted,  then  it  is  possible  their  interaction  and 
mixing.  Certainly,  it  is  not  completely  obvious  that  such  SP  bums  as  homogeneous  system: 
highly  reactive  oxidizer  even  before  the  complete  mixing  can  react  with  the  fuel  in  the  liquid 
phase  creating  the  non-uniformity  of  heat  evolution.  Furthermore,  the  not  completely  mixed 
components,  vaporizing  by  separate  streams,  can  cause  non-uniformity  in  the  gas  phase.  The  ex¬ 
periments  conducted  with  containing  the  nitramine  filler  SP  [2,4]  showed  that  in  sufficiently 
large  pressure  domain  and  in  a  reasonably  wide  size  range  of  filler  particles  the  combustion  of  SP 
only  slightly  depends  on  the  value  of  grain  size.  In  Ref.  [3],  the  photographs  of  SP  surface  are 
presented  (formulations  based  on  octogen  or  hexogen  with  the  polyurethane  binder)  taken  before 
and  after  the  combustion  at  p=20  atm.  On  the  extinguished  surface  the  uniform  fine-grained 
structure  has  been  observed  with  grain  size  much  less  than  in  the  fresh  sample  section.  This  indi¬ 
cates  the  quasi-homogeneity  of  composition  upon  the  combustion  of  SP.  It  is  natural  to  use  in  this 
case  the  models  developed  for  homogeneous  formulation  with  the  rate  control  stage  in  the  gas 
phase  (as  for  nitramine,  which  composes  here  major  part  of  mass  of  SP).  In  Ref.  [4],  the  model 
developed  earlier  [5]  for  homogeneous  EM  of  the  type  of  nitroglycerin  powder  (see  Chapter  2)  is 
examined.  The  utilization  of  this  model,  which  causes  doubts  namely  in  the  case  of  nitroglycerin 
powders  where  the  rate  control  stage  can  he  in  the  condensed  phase,  is  more  substantiated  for  the 
SP  based  on  nitramines.

In  the  model  [4],  the  combustion  regime  with  gas  phase  rate  control  stage  has  been  taken  for  ex¬ 
amination.  The  model  was  developed  for  SP  containing  nitramines  and  DB  propellant  as  a 
binder-fuel.

cal/g;  Qs>db  =  100  cal/g;  Qs,ox  =  50  cal/g;  T0=293  K.  The  value  of  QS)0X  is  used  as  the  matching 
coefficient  because  of  the  lack  of  reliable  data  (in  more  detail  about  the  characteristics  of  octogen

so  that  (3.1)-(3.4)  represent  the  system  of  transcendental  equations.  Dependence  of  T2  on  the

into  consideration.  From  (3.1)-(3.4)  it  is  easy  to  obtain

3.2.2.  Formulations  with  fine  size  heterogeneous  components. 

If  size  of  filler  particles  is  sufficiently  small,  then  even  in  the  absence  of  melting  the  process  of 
combustion  of  heterogeneous  composition  can  be  treated  as  quasi-homogeneous.  The  combustion 
model  for  such  compositions  was  developed  in  Ref.  [6]  using  following  assumptions: 

—  the  rate  control  role  in  the  process  of  combustion  belongs  to  condensed  phase  reactions; 

—  the  burning  rate  is  determined  by  the  decomposition  of  oxidizer; 

—  the  combustion  system  is  quasi-homogeneous  and  one-dimensional,  i.e.,  the  size  of  grain  of 
oxidizer  is  much  smaller  than  the  thickness  of  preheated  layer. 

The  problem  formulation  takes  account  of  exothermic  decomposition  of  oxidizer  (for  example, 
AP),  the  endothermal  decomposition  of  fuel,  the  oxidation  of  fuel  by  the  gaseous  decomposition 
products  of  oxidizer,  the  endothermal  processes  an  the  surface  (sublimation,  vaporization,  disper¬ 
sion).  Model  is  described  by  following  equations  in  the  condensed  phase  0<  x  <°°

The  system  of  transcendental  equations  (3.7)-(3.12)  makes  it  possible  to  calculate  parameters  m, 
Ts,  T|si,  r|S2,  T|S3  as  function  of  p,  To,  s.  The  model  under  discussion,  in  contrast  to  the  above  model 
with  melting  and  the  rate  control  stage  in  the  gas  phase,  gives  essential  dependence  m(s).  De¬ 
pending  on  the  values  of  the  entering  the  model  coefficients  it  is  possible  to  obtain  different 
forms  of  curves  for  v(p),  (3(p),  v(T0),  (3(T0),  and  also  numerical  values  for  stability  limits  of  com¬ 
bustion.  This  makes  it  possible  to  qualitatively  explain  experimental  data  for  the  wide  set  of  solid 
propellants. 


Let  us  present  now  the  possible  ways  of  generalizing  the  model  by  removing  some  of  initial  as¬ 
sumptions.  To  eliminate  an  assumption  about  the  rate  control  role  of  the  condensed  phase  is  pos¬ 
sible,  if  one  introduces  into  the  examination  the  intense  reactions  in  the  gas  phase.  It  is  conven¬ 
ient  to  use  for  this  the  model  presented  in  Chapter  2  for  the  combustion  of  homogeneous  propel¬ 
lant  [8].  According  to  the  model,  the  burning  rate  in  the  wide  range  of  the  parameters  can  be  ob¬ 
tained  by  solving  separately  the  given  system  of  equations  for  two  cases:  a)  without  taking  into 
account  heat  evolution  in  the  condensed  phase;  b)  without  taking  into  account  heat  evolution  in 
the  gas  phase.  After  that  it  suffices  to  compute  the  sum  of  the  obtained  linear  burning  rates. 
Solving  this  problem,  one  should  keep  in  mind  used  in  [8]  assumption  about  the  open  porosity  of 
the  zone  of  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase. 


The  possibility  to  eliminate  an  assumption  about  the  smallness  of  the  size  of  the  oxidizer  grain  as 
compare  with  the  thickness  of  a  preheated  layer  is  examined  in  Ref  [6].  It  is  noted  that  only  with 
keeping  of  this  assumption  the  temperatures  of  the  surface  of  filler  and  binder  (oxidizer  and  fuel) 


3—4 


can  be  considered  identical,  otherwise  it  is  necessary  to  consider  a  difference  in  their  values.  The 
effect  of  the  heterogeneity  nature  of  system  in  this  case  is  proposed  to  consider  within  the  frame¬ 
work  of  quasi-homogeneous  approach  by  the  introduction  of  an  effective  coefficient  of  the  heat 
exchange  between  components,  proportional  to  the  specific  contact  surface.  The  method  of  ac¬ 
counting  the  heterogeneity  nature  is  demonstrated  in  Ref.  [9]  on  the  example  of  the  combustion 
of  homogeneous  propellant  with  inserted  disperse  component,  which  can  be  fuel,  catalyst  or 
metal.  If  the  particle  size  d  of  the  mentioned  component  is  of  the  order  of  the  thickness  of  a  pre¬ 
heated  layer  or  exceeds  it,  it  is  possible  to  disregard  the  chemical  interaction  of  this  component 
with  the  remaining  volume  of  the  propellant  (the  specific  surface  area  of  reaction  is  too  small). 
Then  the  disperse  component  plays  the  role  of  inert  additive,  which  must  be  warmed  up  by  heat 
transfer  from  the  remaining  components.  In  connection  with  this  in  the  equation  of  thermal  con¬ 
ductivity  the  function  of  the  heat-sink  appears 

F  =  -  SNq,  (3.13) 

where  S  -  area  of  the  particle;  N  -  number  of  particles  in  1  cm3;  q  -  heat  flux  into  the  particle.  It  is 
assumed  that  S  ~  d2,  N  ~  a/d3,  q  ~  A,(T-T0)/d,  where  a  -  mass  fraction  of  the  inserted  component. 
Then  (3.13)  can  be  rewritten  in  the  form 

F  ~  Aa(T  -  T0)/d2  (3.14) 

Within  zone  0  <  x  <  where  it  is  possible  to  disregard  the  reactions  of  the  decomposed  compo¬ 
nents  (preheat  zone),  the  equation  of  thermal  conductivity  with  included  F  is  linear  on  T  and  can 
be  easily  solved:

that  on  the  boundary  with  the  zone  of  reactions  (x  =  0)  the  heat  flux  into  preheat  zone  -/IdT/dx, 
calculated  according  to  (3.15),  is  equal  to  the  heat  flux  from  the  zone  of  reactions:

Here  Q  -  thermal  effect  of  decomposition  of  the  propellant,  whose  formulation  does  not  contain 
the  component  in  question.  The  degree  of  decomposition  rjsi  is  connected  with  p,  Ts  according  to 
(3.9).  It  is  also  used  the  relationship  obtained  from  the  examination  of  the  zone  of  reactions, 
where  the  influence  of  particles  can  be  disregarded 

m  ~  exp(-  E /  2RTS )  (3.17) 

The  system  (3.9),  (3.16)  and  (3.17)  makes  it  possible  to  find  m,  T  and  r\s\.  It  is  easy  to  recognize 
that  the  approach  presented  gives  for  the  coarse  particles  (2X/(mcd)<l)  the  increasing  dependence 
m(d):  according  to  (3.15)  and  (3.16)  the  dependence  T(x)  and  value  of  Ts  with  increase  of  d  are 
approaching  from  below,  respectively,  to  the  form  and  values,  which  they  have  without  the  parti¬ 
cles.  Physically  this  corresponds  to  the  decrease  of  relative  heat  losses,  since  with  the  given  a 
increase  of  d  leads  to  decrease  of  specific  heat  exchange  surface  between  the  components.  With 
small  d  (more  accurately,  with  2X/(mcd)  »1)  the  approach  examined  is  not  valid,  in  particular, 
due  to  the  need  for  the  account  of  heterogeneous  reaction  on  the  intercomponent  surface.  How¬ 
ever,  the  condition  2A/(mcd)»l  makes  it  possible  to  neglect  the  temperature  nonuniformity  and 
intercomponent  heat  exchange.  Reactions  on  the  component  interface  can  be  taken  into  account, 


3—5 


for  example,  according  to  quasi -homogeneous  model  presented  above  [6],  which  gives  decreas¬ 
ing  dependence  m(d).  Thus,  the  function  m(d),  decreasing  with  increase  of  d  in  the  domain  of 
small  d  and  increasing  with  the  high  values  of  d,  has  a  minimum.  Analogous  considerations  and 
calculations  permit  to  predict  maximum  for  dependence  v(d),  where  v=  3  lnm/3  lnp.  It  is  inter¬ 
esting  to  note  that  similar  findings  were  made  in  the  experiments  [9]  on  the  combustion  of  model 
SP,  which  contain  75%  AP  (<56  pm),  15%  of  hydrocarbon  binder  (not  capable  of  the  independ¬ 
ent  combustion)  and  10%  of  carbon  with  different  size  d  of  the  particles  (fraction  «1,  <70,  100- 
200,  300-400  pm).  Minimum  m(d)  and  maximum  v(d)  have  been  obtained;  with  increase  of  p  a 
minimum  of  m(d)  is  shifted  to  the  side  of  smaller  d,  which  is  naturally  explained  by  the  decrease 
of  a  preheated  layer  thickness. 

3.2.3.  Critical  assessment  of  quasi-homogeneous  combustion  models 

Let  us  discuss  in  more  detail  the  concepts  presented  in  section  3.2.  In  order  to  evaluate  a  possi¬ 
bility  of  one-dimensional  description  of  the  processes  in  the  zone  of  condensed  phase  reaction  of 
composition  with  components  melted  on  the  surface,  it  is  necessary  to  investigate  complex  pic¬ 
ture  of  penetration  of  the  melts.  Exception  presents  the  case,  when  the  rate  control  stage  is  lo¬ 
cated  in  the  gas  phase  and  the  gas  jets  from  separated  on  the  surface  components  manage  to  mix 
prior  to  the  beginning  of  noticeable  reaction,  i.e.  Xk  >  xd-  Here  Xk  is  the  “kinetic  length”;  Xk  ~ 
m/p8,  where  m  -  mass  flow  rate  and  5  -  order  of  reaction,  p  —  pressure;  xd  is  the  “diffusion 
length”  xd  ~  pgD/m,  where  pg  -  gas  density  and  D  -  diffusion  coefficient.  With  pgD  =  const  this 
regime  can  be  obtained  by  decrease  of  p,  if  v  -  8  <  -v,  v  <  8/2  (and  vice  versa  -  with  increase  of 
p,  if  v  >  8/2).  This  regime  can  also  exist,  in  principle,  for  SP  with  infusible  on  the  surface  compo¬ 
nents  (see  the  BDP  type  models,  Sect.  3.3). 

Model  of  Kubota  [3,4]  is  suitable  for  SP  with  fixed  mass  content  of  melted  component  a,  com¬ 
plete  mixing  of  melt  on  the  surface  and  rate  control  stage  in  the  gas  phase.  However  the  model 
does  not  examine  some  phenomena,  which  can  occur  at  a  significant  variation  of  the  nitramine 
content  in  the  SP  formulation. 

1.  Model  of  Kubota  does  not  consider  a  variation  of  parameters  in  the  gas  phase  with  mass  con¬ 
tent  of  nitramine.  It  is  understandable  that  to  take  this  into  account  is  much  more  difficult  than  in 
the  case  of  existence  of  the  melt  layer  on  the  burning  surface,  where  for  calculation  of  Qi  a  hy¬ 
pothesis  about  the  independent  decomposition  of  the  mixed  components  is  actually  used.  In  the 
examination  of  parallel  gas-phase  reactions  in  contrast  to  condensed  phase  the  location  of  zone 
with  the  rate  control  stage  and  the  degree  of  depletion  for  both  gas  components  in  this  zone  are 
not  known  in  advance.  With  the  change  of  cl  the  entering  in  (3.3)  heat  Q2  (which  determines  T2) 
can  depend  on  a  nonlinearly.  In  addition  the  change  of  the  rate  control  reaction  (change  E2)  can 
occur,  see  [10].  In  connection  with  this  the  account  of  dependence  of  Qion  a  is  useless. 

2.  If  in  combustion  of  double-base  propellant,  used  as  a  binder,  the  rate  control  stage  is  located 
not  in  the  gas  [11],  but  in  the  condensed  phase,  then  with  sufficiently  low  a  the  rate  control  stage 
of  the  SP  combustion  will  also  be  in  the  condensed  phase.  In  this  case  (with  the  strong  change  of 
a)  it  is  profitable  to  use  more  flexible  monopropellant  model,  for  example,  the  model  [39].  It  is 
easy  to  show  that  this  model,  which  represents  a  special  case  of  BDP  model,  predicts  the  modes 
of  stage  detachment,  gas  phase  control  and  even  stage  merging  (true,  but  with  the  unlikely  values 
of  the  parameters). 


3—6 


Come  further  to  discussion  of  the  combustion  model  for  SP  with  fine  size  of  oxidizer  particles 
and  rate  control  reactions  in  condensed  phase.  It  should  be  underlined  that  in  this  case  the  oxi¬ 
dizer  size  must  be  less  than  a  thickness  of  the  reaction  zone  in  condensed  phase,  not  a  thickness 
of  preheated  layer,  as  it  was  stated  in  Ref.  [6].  By  integration  specifically  in  the  zone  of  reactions 
the  formulas  (3.10)  and  (3.11)  are  obtained.  Using  in  this  case  one-dimensional  equations  (3.5)- 
(3.6)  within  the  zone  of  reactions,  we  implicitly  assume  that  the  size  of  the  heterogeneity,  not 
considered  by  these  equations,  is  considerably  smaller  than  the  thickness  of  the  zone  of  reactions. 
Note,  that  if  the  size  of  the  oxidizer  particles  is  lower  than  the  thickness  of  a  preheated  layer,  but 
exceeds  the  thickness  of  a  zone  of  reactions,  then  the  temperature  distribution  can  be  considered 
uniform  across  a  preheated  layer  (one-dimensional),  but  only  out  of  the  zone  of  reactions,  where 
the  heat  evolution  creates  in  homogeneity  on  temperature  profile.  The  correctness  of  the  deriva¬ 
tion  of  formulae  (3.10),  (3.11)  in  this  case  would  be  disturbed.  The  examples  of  the  account  of 
the  heterogeneity  of  the  heat  evolution  see  below,  in  Section  3.3  (UTD-model). 

In  Ref.  [7],  evaluation  of  thickness  of  zone  of  reactions  AxCh  =  (RTs2/E)/(dT/dx)  is  given.  Here 
dT/dx  -  characteristic  value  of  the  temperature  gradient.  In  our  case  it  is  of  the  order  u(Ts-To)/k, 
k  -  thermal  diffusivity.  Let  us  substitute  the  values  typical  for  the  double-base  propellants:  E  ~  20 
kcal/mol,  T  ~  650  K,  R=1.96  cal/(mol  K),  T0  ~  300  K,  u  ~  0.5  cm/s,  x  ~  0.001  cm2/s;  then  Axch  ~ 
2  pm.  Then  the  condition  of  quasi-homogeneity  takes  the  form  Dox«2  pm  (Dox  -  size  of  the  oxi¬ 
dizer  particles),  i.e.,  model  is  applicable  only  to  compositions  with  ultra-dispersed  filler.  In  prac¬ 
tice  such  compositions  are  used  rarely,  but  the  relevant  quasi-homogeneous  model  can  he  used 
for  describing  the  combustion  of  pseudo-propellant,  corresponded  to  the  finest  fraction  of  the 
polydisperse  oxidizer  (see  Chapter  4). 

In  connection  with  that  stated  above  it  is  difficult  to  agree  with  the  statement  of  authors  [6]  about 
possibility  of  spreading  the  model  to  the  range  of  oxidizer  particles  sizes  D0  >  k/u  within  the 
framework  of  homogeneous  approach  [9].  However,  the  idea  developed  in  Ref.  [9]  of  the  account 
of  intercomponent  heat  exchange  deserves  special  discussion.  It  is  important  to  note  that  investi¬ 
gation  [9]  is  carried  out  for  the  initially  homogeneous  composition  with  the  inserted  particles  re¬ 
acting  at  sufficiently  high  temperature  only  on  their  surface.  For  this  very  reason  the  particles  of 
sufficiently  large  size  d,  whose  total  reacting  surface  per  unit  of  the  burning  surface  is  low,  be¬ 
come  the  heat  sinks. 

According  to  Ref.  [9]  a  decreasing  dependence  m(d)  takes  place  in  the  domain  of  small  d,  where 
quasi-homogeneous  model  is  valid  and  with  increase  of  d  the  specific  surface  area  in  the  reaction 
zone  decreases.  The  dependence  m(d)  becomes  increasing  with  large  d,  when  particles  bum  in 
the  regime  of  heat-sink  and  the  specific  (per  unit  volume)  power  of  the  heat  loss  decreases  with 
increase  of  d.  Thus,  it  follows  a  basic  result,  agreeing  with  the  experiment:  the  existence  of 
minimum  in  the  curve  m(d)  and  its  displacement  with  increase  of  p  into  the  domain  of  small  d. 

Mathematically,  the  case  d  »  k/u  is  examined  in  [9],  although  regime  of  heat-sink  begins  al¬ 
ready  with  d  >AxCh.  The  range  of  variation  of  d,  which  is  of  great  interest,  is  excluded  by  this 
from  the  examination.  It  is  noteworthy  that  precisely  in  this  region  the  averaging  for  the  purpose 
of  obtaining  the  one-dimensional  equation  of  thermal  conductivity  is  still  justified  (see  Section 
2.3). 


3—7 


Finally,  assignment  of  heat  flux  into  particle  in  the  form  q~A,(T-To)/d  introduces  large  error:  with 
small  d  it  overestimates  heat  losses  (in  particular,  for  d— >0  they  become  according  to  this  formula 
infinite,  in  this  case  Ts->To)  and  for  large  d  it  underestimates  them.  According  to  the  used  de¬ 
pendence  in  this  case  q— >0,  but  actually  q  ~  mc(Ts-To),  since  in  large  particle  a  preheated  layer  is 
forming  with  the  thickness  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude,  as  in  the  interlayer  space  with  the 
equality  of  the  thermal  constants  of  the  material  of  interlayer  and  particles. 

3.3.  HETEROGENEOUS  SYSTEMS  WITH  UNIFORM  TEMPERATURE  DISTRIBU¬ 
TION  IN  A  PREHEAT  ZONE  (UTD  -  MODELS) 

Let  us  assume  that  the  size  of  the  oxidizer  particles  is  greater  than  the  thickness  of  the  reaction 
zone  in  the  condensed  phase,  but  it  is  considerably  smaller  than  the  thickness  of  preheated  layer, 
i.e.,  AxCh  <  D0  «  k/u.  In  this  case  the  preheated  layer  can  be  considered  uniform  in  temperature, 
but  in  the  reaction  zone  of  the  condensed  phase  one  should  take  into  consideration  the  non- 
uniformity  of  the  heat  evolution  and  caused  by  it  temperature  non-uniformity  in  the  gas  phase,  as 
well  as  transient  character  of  gas  release  from  the  burning  surface  with  the  time  scale  of  order  of 
burnout  time  for  the  oxidizer  grain.  In  order  to  use  upon  the  derivation  of  the  heat  balance  an  as¬ 
sumption  on  one-dimensionality  of  the  temperature  profile  in  a  preheated  layer,  the  heat  flux  into 
the  condensed  phase  has  to  be  averaged  over  the  surface  of  SP.  For  UTD-models  this  averaging 
simulates  the  real  physical  process  of  the  leveling  of  heat  fluxes,  which  occur  under  the  SP  sur¬ 
face  in  the  layer  with  a  thickness  of  ~  Do.  It  is  possible  to  consider  the  averaging,  which  is  char¬ 
acteristic  for  the  UTD-models,  of  the  mass  burning  rate  m  over  the  surface  of  SP  as  a  natural  ad¬

C.  E.  Hermance  [12]  developed  the  model  for  the  case,  when  particle  size  exceeds  thickness  of  a 
reaction  zone.  It  was  later  established  that  the  field  of  the  model  application  is  very  limited;  how¬ 
ever,  it  was  used  as  a  basis  for  developing  many  subsequent  versions  of  the  UTD-models.  The 
problem  is  formulated  for  SP  containing  oxidizer  with  mass  fraction  a  and  particle  size  Do.  Actu¬ 
ally  a  polydisperse  SP  is  examined.  The  following  processes  of  chemical  nature  are  considered:

a)  the  endothermal  decomposition  of  fuel-binder  (with  a  mass  flow  rate  mf  and  thermal  effect  Qf) 
on  the  flat  part  Sf  of  the  cross-section  surface  So  of  the  sample; 


3—8 


b)  the  two-stage  exothermic  decomposition  of  oxidizer  with  summary  heat  release  (Qgp  -  Ql); 

c)  the  exothermic  heterogeneous  reaction  (with  a  mass  flow  rate  mEf)  of  the  decomposition  prod¬ 
ucts  of  solid  oxidizer  on  the  curve  surface  sef  of  binder,  contacted  with  the  recess  around  the 
crystals  (Fig.  3.1). 

In  the  gas  flame  the  reaction  products  of  the  stages  a),  b)  and  c)  interact  with  thermal  effect  Qf-  It 
is  assumed  that  these  products  have  sufficient  time  for  mixing,  and  gas  flame  can  be  considered 
one-dimensional.  The  temperature  of  the  burning  surface  is  assumed  identical  over  entire  section 
of  SP  sample.  The  one-dimensional  equation  of  thermal  conductivity  in  a  preheated  layer  of  the 
condensed  phase  is  used.  It  is  valid,  as  it  was  noted  above,  with  satisfaction  of  condition  Do<k/u. 
The  decomposition  (pyrolysis)  of  binder  is  described  by  equation 

mf  ~exp(-Ef/RTs)  (3.18) 

Heterogeneous  reaction  is  described  by: 

mE/  ~  C exp(-  Ee  /  RTS )  (3.19) 

Here  C  -  concentration  of  oxidizer  in  the  annular  gap  (recess  with  the  depth  8  around  the  crystal 
of  oxidizer).  It  is  assumed  that  this  concentration  corresponds  to  the  equilibrium  partial  pressure 
above  crystal  of  the  oxidizer: 

C  -  exp(-  Em  /  RTS )  (3.20) 

Such  supposition  is  justified  in  the  case  of  rather  narrow  gap  around  crystal  and  moderate  rate 
heterogeneous  reaction.  As  far  as  oxidizer  is  concerned,  it  is  assumed  that  its  combustion  will 
“adjust”  to  the  combustion  behavior  of  binder  in  the  gap  and  over  the  flat  region.  Thus,  the  total 
mass  burning  rate  becomes  proportional  to  the  consumption  rate  of  binder: 

ms0(l-a)  =  sfmf  +  stfmEf  (3.21) 

It  is  also  assumed  that  the  combustion  of  binder  in  gaps  makes  a  negligible  effect  on  the 
flat  surface  Sf  of  binder  as  compared  with  its  value  for  the  fresh  cut  of  the  propellant  sample. 
Therefore,  it  is  taken  Sf  =  (l-a)so  and  mass  balance  takes  the  form 

m  =  mf  +(Sef  / s0)m^  /(l -a)  (3.22) 

In  order  to  find  sg  it  is  necessary  to  examine  surface  of  gap  around  single  spherical  crystal, 

which  is  equal  approximately  to  7iDce  (see  Fig.  3.1).  Here  Dc  is  the  diameter  of  cross  section  of 
burning  crystal  by  the  binder  plane.  With  chaotic  distribution  of  oxidizer  particles  in  the  bulk  of 
SP,  the  burning  surface  contains  different  value  Dc  and  e(Dc)  corresponding  to  different  locations 
of  particles: 

=  '£*DAD«)=  MdA,  (3.23) 

1=1 

Here  N  -  number  of  particles,  whose  sections  are  located  on  the  cut  plane  of  sample.  In  par¬ 
ticular,  if  we  assume  e(Dc)~Dc  then  it  is  possible  to  use  statement,  known  in  stereometry,  that  in 
the  multi -component  mixture  with  disordered  structure  the  components  are  represented  on  the 
sufficiently  large  plane  cross  section  in  the  same  ratio,  as  in  the  bulk  of  the  mixture: 
^tc D2ci  /  4  =  Cv  where  £  -  volume  fraction  of  oxidizer. 

On  the  other  hand,  on  the  cross  section  of  sample  we  can  fix  only  those  particles,  whose  centers 
are  misaligned  not  more  than  by  ±  Dq/2  from  this  section  and,  consequently,  they  all  are  located 


in  the  volume  v=s0D0.  Thus,  for  the  N  particles  and  for  the  mean  cross-sectional  area  of  particle 
we  obtain  the  relationships: 

N  =  &/(nD30  /6)=  6^0  /^o- 

2*0’/4  =  C«„  =Nn(D^/4  =  {3/2%s0(D±IDl  , 

feL=f  o.2  <324) 

With  e(Dc)  ~  Dc  the  relationship  (3.23)  takes  the  form 

sef/s0=4&/Dc  (3.25) 

Actually  e/Dc*  const,  but  in  view  of  the  complexity  of  computing  the  entering  in  (3.33)  sums  it  is 
proposed  in  [12]  to  approximately  calculate  sef  /  s0  by  (3.  25),  computing  there  value  e(Dc)/Dc 

when  Dc  =  Do V2/3  . 


It  is  assumed  that  the  depth  of  gap  8  is  equal  to  the  size  of  burned  out  part  of  initial  sphere  of  AP 
from  the  top  along  the  axis  of  symmetry: 

£  =  D0  -  D  =  uox  (tc  —  tign ),  uox  ~  p  ,  tign  ~  D0  /  p  , 

/  r\  (3.26) 

tc~Llu,  L-D0\ l  +  l/v3j/2,  uf-mf/pf 

Here  uox  and  Uf  -  linear  burning  rates  of  oxidizer  and  binder;  tign  -  ignition  time  of  oxidizer;  tc  - 
time  of  reaching  by  the  flat  binder  surface  of  the  point,  where  the  section  of  the  virgin  particle  of 

oxidizer  would  have  a  diameter  of  Dc  =  D0V2/3  .  Constants  5,  k,  n  and  proportionality  factors  in 
(3.26)  are  taken  from  the  experimental  investigations  of  other  authors. 


On  the  burning  surface  the  balance  of  heat  for  lg  of  SP  is  written: 

c(Ts  -T0)  =  -aQL+(a-m¥sg/ ms0 )Qsp  + 

/msQ-(mfsf  /ms0)Qf  +QF  exp(-£*) 

In  this  equation  the  first  term  in  the  right  hand  side  determines  heat  expenditures  for  the  first  (en- 
dothermal)  stage  of  the  oxidizer  decomposition.  The  second  term  indicates  heat  evolution  in  the 
second  stage  of  decomposition  reaction,  which  is  realized  in  immediate  proximity  of  the  oxidizer 
surface.  In  this  case  it  is  considered  that  in  the  reactions  of  this  stage  the  oxidizer,  which  has  al¬ 
ready  reacted  in  the  gap  with  the  binder,  does  not  participate.  Remaining  terms  correspond  to  the 
heat  evolution  in  the  gap,  heat  expenditures  for  the  pyrolysis  of  binder  on  the  flat  part  of  its  sur¬ 
face  and  the  heat  feedback  from  the  gas  phase.  The  multiplier  exp(-^*)  designates  the  reaching 
the  burning  surface  fraction  of  the  heat,  which  was  released  in  the  flame.  For  the  second-order 
reaction  the  relationships  are  used 

X=mcx*fk,  x*=mx/f)F,  l/x*p gexp(-E/RTF)  (3.28) 

Thermal  effect  Qf  of  the  gas  flame  is  assumed  as  not  depending  on  p  and  To.  The  variability  of 
the  flame  temperature,  hence,  automatically  follows  from  the  relationship 

c(Tf-T0)  =  Qf  +Qs  (3.29) 

For  simplicity,  the  magnitudes  of  the  heat  capacity  for  the  condensed  phase  and  gas  are  taken 
identical,  that  does  not  introduce  large  error  since  they  are  actually  close  in  value.  The  value  Qs  in 
(3.29)  marks  total  heat  release  on  the  surface,  i.e.,  it  is  equal  to  the  right  side  (3.27)  without  the 


last  term.  It  is  evident  that  this  expression,  generally  speaking,  depends  on  pressure  and  initial 
temperature. 

The  above  equations  form  a  closed  system  and  permit  to  calculate  numerically  m(p,  To,  a,  Do).  It 
must  be  noted  that  the  model  was  created  specifically  for  SP  with  AP  as  an  oxidizer.  For  the 
compositions,  which  contain  AP  and  polysulfide  binder,  calculations  were  carried  out,  which 
showed  a  good  accord  with  experiment  on  dependence  m(p)  in  the  wide  interval  of  pressures  (to 
1000  atm)  and  considerably  worse  accord  on  the  temperature  sensitivity.  In  initial  work  [12]  the 
weak  places  for  model  were  noted,  the  main  thing  from  which  -  the  absence  of  the  proofs  of  the 
existence  of  heterogeneous  reactions  on  the  binder  and  resulting  finite  value  gaps  around  crystals 
of  AP.  Actually,  subsequently  it  was  revealed  ([17,  18],  see  also  Section  3.4),  that  during  AP 
combustion  in  the  SP  formulation  recesses  around  the  crystals  are  not  formed,  and  this  questions 
the  fitness  of  the  model  for  describing  the  combustion  of  SP  on  AP. 

Concepts,  developed  in  [12],  can  nevertheless  be  useful,  in  particular,  when  studying  combustion 
of  SP  based  on  oxidizer  not  capable  of  independent  combustion,  for  example,  KC104. 


3.3.2.  Competing  flames  (Beckstead-Derr-Price)  model 

Experimental  observations  [17],  according  to  which  during  combustion  of  real  SP  the  gaps 
around  AP  particles,  as  a  rule,  are  not  formed,  were  used  as  a  basis  for  developing  model  of  com¬ 
peting  flames 

[13],  called  as  BDP  model  for  surnames  of  authors:  Beckstead,  Derr,  Price. 


Fig.  3.2.  Diagram  of  flames  in  BDP  model. 


In  contrast  to  the  Hermance  model  [12],  in  BDP  model  it  is  assumed  that  binder  plays  passive 
role,  and  rate  of  its  bum  out  (pyrolysis)  is  adjusted  to  the  rate  of  bum  out  of  oxidizer.  The  new 
diagram  of  the  flames  is  postulated  (see  Fig.  3.2):  it  is  assumed  that  the  reaction  between  the  fuel 
and  oxidizer  occurs  not  on  the  surface  of  the  ring  recess  around  the  AP  particle,  but  in  the  diffu¬ 
sion  flame.  The  two-stage  decomposition  reaction  of  AP  is  divided  in  space.  The  first  stage  is  re- 


3—1 1 


alized  in  the  zone  of  the  reactions  in  condensed  phase  and,  in  the  contrast  to  [12],  it  is  considered 
exothermic,  since  besides  the  dissociative  sublimation  of  some  part  of  AP  it  includes  solid-phase 
decomposition  of  approximately  70%  AP  to  the  end  products.  The  second  stage,  where  the  oxi¬ 
dation  of  ammonia  by  perchloric  acid  is  considered  the  main  step,  is  realized  in  purely  kinetic 
"natural  flame”  of  AP.  In  the  place  of  the  contact  of  natural  flame  2  (AP)  with  the  diffusion  one 
the  latter  is  divided  into  two  parts:  primary  flame  1  (PF)  and  final  diffusion  flame  3  (FF).  In  con¬ 
trast  to  the  model  of  Hermance,  the  temperature  Tf  of  the  final  flame  is  calculated  thermody¬ 
namically  on  the  basis  of  SP  formulation  and  therefore  weakly  depends  on  pressure 

Thus,  a  non-uniformity  of  the  heat  evolution  is  taken  into  consideration  on  the  surface  of  SP  (heat 
liberation  on  AP  and  heat  absorption  on  binder)  and  in  the  gas  phase  where  for  determining  the 
form  of  flame  it  is  necessary  to  solve  two-dimensional  problem  of  heat  propagation  and  species 
diffusion.  The  versions  of  its  solution  are  given  in  Section  3.4.2.  Let  us  only  note  that  in  accor¬ 
dance  with  the  version  of  solution  of  the  Burke-Schumann  problem,  used  in  [13],  the  flame  over¬ 
hangs  the  oxidizer  or  fuel  depending  on  what  component  in  SP  is  in  excess  as  compared  with  the 
stoichiometric  ratio.  As  a  rule,  the  fuel  in  excess  and  the  flame  is  sloped  to  the  side  of  AP,  al¬ 
though  in  the  combustion  of  polydisperse  compositions  for  the  largest  in  size  fractions  of  AP  the 
opposite  situation  is  possible.  It  is  considered  that  the  primary  flame  begins  at  certain  "kinetic" 
height  x*RPF  above  the  line  of  contact  of  AP  with  the  fuel. 

It  is  assumed  that  the  surface  of  binder  is  plane  and  vaporization  occurs  with  heat  expenditure  Qf. 
The  expressions  for  the  pyrolysis  law  for  the  surface  of  oxidizer  and  the  total  balance  of  heat  on 
the  surface  of  SP  are  taken  in  the  form: 

mox*  =  Aox  exP (-£<*  I RT )  (3-3°) 

SomTC(Ts  ~  T0  )  =  — , W10xSoxQl  _  mfS  fQf  ^  P  pQpFmTS  o  *  (2.31) 

xexp (-x*PFcmT  / X)  +  (1  -  PF)moxsox[QAP  exp (~x*APcm0X  IX)  +  QFF  exp (~xFFcmm  IX)} 

It  is  necessary  to  find  hit  and  Ts  as  functions  of  p,  To,  Do,  a.  Here  mox  and  mf  -  mass  burning  rates 
(g/cm2s)  of  oxidizer  and  binder,  respectively;  Ts  -  surface  temperature,  which,  as  in  [12],  is  as¬ 
sumed  to  be  identical  for  the  entire  surface.  Since  the  role  of  binder  is  considered  secondary  and 
it  is  not  necessary  to  use  for  it  the  strongly  depending  on  Ts  expression  of  type  (3.30),  assumption 
about  uniform  distribution  of  Ts  over  the  surface  does  not  introduce  significant  error. 

In  expression  (3.3 1)  the  value  s0  =  sox  +  Sf  corresponds  to  the  burning  surface  of  sample;  sox  and  Sf 
-  correspond  to  the  surfaces  of  oxidizer  and  binder,  respectively.  Note,  that  the  surface  of  oxi¬ 
dizer  is  bent  (see  Fig.  3.2)  due  to  the  fact  that  crystal  of  AP  projects  above  binder  (or  is  lowered) 
to  the  height  h.  In  Ref.  [13]  the  derivation  is  given  of  expressions  for  h/D0  and  sox/s0=  f(£,h/D0), 
where  £  -  relative  volume  fraction  of  AP  in  the  propellant;  D0  -  particle  size.  The  AP  crystal 
shape  is  considered  in  the  form  of  a  spherical  segment.  The  values  of  s0niT,  soxmox  and  Sfinf  are 
the  total  mass  flow  from  the  burning  surface  of  SP  and  the  mass  flows  of  the  products  of  gasifi¬ 
cation  of  AP  and  binder,  respectively.  The  relationships  are  hold 

moXsox  =  as0mT,  nifSf  =  ( 1  -a)SomT  (3 .32) 

where  a  -  relative  mass  fraction  of  AP  in  the  propellant.  The  relation  between  mT  and  mean  linear 
burning  rate  of  SP  is  discussed  at  the  end  of  this  Section.  Taking  into  account  (3.32)  relationship 
(3.31)  takes  the  form 


3—12 


c(Ts  -T0)  =  -aQL  - (1  -  a)Qf  +  pFQPF  exp (~x*PFcmT  IX)  + 

+  a(  1  -  PF  )[Qap  exp (~x\Pcmox  IX)  +  QFF  exp {-x*FFcmox  IX)}  (3.33) 

The  left  hand  side  of  expression  (3.33)  stands  for  the  heat  required  for  heating  the  unit  mass  of 
the  propellant  from  T0  to  Ts.  In  the  right  hand  side  of  expression  (3.33)  the  values  -  ocQl  and  (1  - 
cc)Qf  stand  for  amounts  of  heat  necessary  for  the  conversion  into  the  gaseous  state  of  oxidizer  and 
binder  with  their  appropriate  mass  fractions  a  and  (1-a).  Remaining  terms  correspond  to  the  heat 
feedback  to  the  burning  surface  from  different  flames  (see  Fig.  3.2).  Here  Qpf,  Qap,  Qff  -  thermal 
effects  of  flames  1, 2  and  3.  Value  of  QPF  is  calculated  per  lg  of  reaction  products  in  flame  1,  Qap 
and  Qff  -  per  lg  of  AP  consumed  in  these  flames.  Therefore  the  terms  in  (3.33),  which  corre¬ 
spond  to  the  flames  2  and  3,  are  multiplied  by  a.  Value  (3F  is  the  portion  of  AP,  which  bums  out 
in  flame  1;  (1  ~pF)  is  the  portion  of  AP,  which  reacts  in  the  flame  2  and  then  is  finally  in  flame  3. 
The  heat  capacities  of  solid  and  gaseous  oxidizer  and  fuel  are  considered  identical.  Exponential 
multipliers  in  (3.33)  show  what  portion  of  the  heat,  which  is  liberated  in  the  appropriate  flame  at 
a  distance  of  x*  from  the  burning  surface,  reaches  this  surface.  Relationship  of  type  (1.13),  valid 
for  the  delta-like  distribution  of  the  heat  sources,  actually  is  used.  For  xap*  expression  (3.34)  is 
used,  which  corresponds  to  the  model  of  the  flat  gas  flame  with  the  order  8  of  the  reaction  in  the 
rate  control  stage 

x*ap  =mox^AP  '  PS)>  8  =  1-8;  kAP  =1.12  (cm3  -s-atm5) 1  (3.34) 

Values  of  kAP  and  5  are  found  experimentally.  Flames  1,  3  are  close  in  the  shape  to  parabolic 
ones.  Referring  to  the  results  of  own  calculations,  the  authors  of  the  BDP  model  reported  that  in 
terms  of  the  total  heat  flux  into  the  condensed  phase  the  parabolic  flame  with  a  height  of  xD*  is 
equivalent  to  the  flat  flame  with  the  same  summary  heat  evolution,  which  has  the  same  projected 
area  on  the  surface  of  SP  and  height  x*D  (distance  from  the  base  of  parabolic  flame): 

x*D  =  AshxD>  A,h  (3-35) 

As  far  as  entering  in  (3.35)  height  x*D  of  parabolic  flame  is  concerned,  from  the  analysis  of  the 
solution  of  Burke-Schumann  (see  Section  3.4.2)  the  conclusion  is  made  that  the  height  of  para¬ 
bolic  is  close  to  the  diameter  of  its  base,  i.e.,  to  the  diameter  Dc  of  section  of  the  AP  particle  with 
the  plane  of  the  binder  (see  Fig.  3.2).  The  parabolic  flames  on  the  right  side  of  the  diagram,  de¬ 
picted  in  Fig.  3.2,  are  substituted  by  the  “effective"  flat  flames.  Their  height  is  calculated  from 
the  formulas 

X FF  X AP  "1”  ^*3 % DFF  ’  X PF  X RPF  ~^~AshXDPF  (3.36) 

Here  x*rpf  -  kinetic"  height  of  primary  flame.  For  x*rpf  the  formula  of  type  (3.34)  is  used: 

XRPF  =  mT  /(& PF  •  P5ff  )  (3.37) 

As  reported  in  Ref.  19,  in  the  subsequent  versions  of  the  BDP  model  the  dependencies  were  taken 
into  account  of  multipliers  kAP,  kPF  in  (3.34,  3.37)  on  the  temperature  of  the  corresponding 
flames: 

k  ~  exp  {-El  RT )  (3.38) 

Values  of  the  temperature  of  primary  and  final  diffusion  flames  are  calculated  thermodynami¬ 
cally  on  the  basis  of  the  propellant  formulation  and,  consequently,  they  depend  on  the 
fuel/oxidizer  (f/ox)  ratio  in  the  propellant,  i.e.  kPP  =  kPF(f/ox).  Taking  into  account  (3.38),  the 
value  kAP  depends  on  (f/ox)  and  on  the  particle  size,  since  Tap  is  somewhat  increased  due  to  the 
heating  from  the  final  flame.  Thus,  when  presenting  in  Ref.  19  the  modified  BDP  model,  the  ex¬ 
pression  for  Tap  is  given  in  the  form

Entering  in  (3.36)  the  diffusion  lengths  x*DFF,  x*Dpf  (height  of  "paraboloids",  see  Fig.  3.2)  can  be 
determined  with  the  help  of  the  solution  of  Burke-Schumann  (detail  see  in  Section  3.4.2).  Let  us 
note  here  that  according  to  this  solution  the  height  of  the  "parabolic"  diffusion  flame  depends 
mainly  on  the  diameter  of  its  base  and  (in  less  extent)  on  the  f/ox  ratio  for  the  gaseous  mixture 
and  other  parameters.  In  particular,  in  Fig.  3.2  broken  line  on  the  top  of  diagram  shows  the  part  of 
diffusion  flame,  which  would  be  realized  in  the  absence  of  inherent  flame  of  AP.  In  the  real  case, 
passing  through  the  flame  front  of  AP,  gaseous  mixture  changes  its  f/ox  ratio,  becoming  more 
fuel  rich,  that  also  leads  to  the  elongation  of  the  final  diffusion  flame. 

In  the  BDP  model,  it  is  proposed  to  use  the  fact  that  for  sufficiently  low  values  of  the  product 

mDo  (with  mDo<10'3  g/(cm  s),  see  derivation  in  Section  3.4.2)  the  height  of  "parabolic"  flame 

according  to  the  solution  of  Burke-Schumann  can  he  taken  equal  to  the  diameter  of  its  base.  In 

this  case,  assuming  the  form  of  the  diffusion  flames  parabolic,  it  is  easy  to  find  the  unknown 

heights  by  geometric  method.  Value  of  ASh  in  the  second  formula  (3.36)  is  not  specified  in  Ref. 

[13],  but  from  the  "geometric"  evaluations  it  is  clear  that  it  is  changed  from  0.3  when  x  ap-x  rpf  ^ 

x*dpf  (value,  obtained  in  [13  ]  for  the  first  formula  (  3  36) )  to  0.5  (x  rpf  +  x  ap/x  dpf  when  x  ap  -

Fraction  pFof  oxidizer,  reacting  in  the  primary  flame,  is  determined  as  the  ratio  of  area  of  the  ring 
projection  of  primary  flame  on  the  base  of  parabolic  to  the  total  base  area: 

(3-40) 

From  Fig.  3.2  it  is  evident  that  even  for  particles  of  AP  of  the  same  size  there  is  a  wide  range  of 
values  of  areas  of  the  burning  surfaces  at  each  moment  of  time.  Since  (3.33)  is  obtained  by  aver¬ 
aging  over  the  entire  surface  of  sample,  the  last  terms,  in  which  pf,  x*pf,  xff  depend  on  diameter 
of  the  base  of  parabolic,  are  written  for  certain  effective  diameter  Dc  of  particle.  It  is  clear  that  it 
would  be  more  accurate  to  use  summation  of  individual  particle  sections  over  surface.  However, 
this  is  rather  complicated,  and  as  Dc  the  BPD  model  uses  introduced  earlier  by  Hermance  [12] 

value  Dc  =  D0a/2/3  . 

Below  the  derivation  of  several  relationships  of  BPD  model  is  given. 

1.  Thermal  effects  in  the  flames  are  determined  in  (3.33)  by 

Qap=c{Tap-T0)  +  Ql  (3.41) 

Qpf  =  c{Tf  -T0)  +  aQL+{ l- a )Qf  (3.42) 

Qpf  /  CL  =  Qap  +  Qff  (3.43) 

Heat  capacity  of  gas  and  solid  propellant  is  assumed  to  be  identical  -c  ~  0.3  cal/(g  C).  Relation¬ 
ship  (3.41)  indicates  that  the  heat  release  of  AP  combustion  is  expended  on  its  heating  from  T0  = 
300  K  to  Tap  ~  1400°C  and  on  dissociative  sublimation  with  the  heat  480  cal/g.  Thus,  total  heat 
release  is  equal  to  0.3  (1400-300)+480  =  810  cal/g.  However,  part  of  this  heat  is  liberated  within 
and  on  the  surface  of  AP.  Authors  [13]  considered  that  this  part  composes  75%  and  it  does  not 
depend  on  pressure  and  initial  temperature  (in  [20]  it  was  assumed  70%),  then  Qap  =  210  cal/g, 
Ql  =  480-0.75  810  =  -120  cal/g.

Relationship  (3.42)  means  that  the  heat  liberation  in  a  primary  flame  is  spent  for  heating  of  rea¬ 
gents  from  T0  to  TF.  TF  is  considered  as  temperature  of  the  final  products  of  the  propellant  com¬ 
bustion)  and  for  spending  on  the  effects,  connected  with  transformations  of  reagents  on  the 
burning  surface.  In  this  case  it  is  considered  that  reagents  enter  into  flame  1  in  the  same  (in  the 
general  case  -  nonstoichiometric)  ratio  (l-a)/a,  in  which  they  are  contained  in  the  propellant. 
Namely  for  this  ratio  the  calculation  of  TF(a)  is  conducted. 

Relationship  (3.43)  means  that  with  combustion  of  lg  of  AP  in  the  flame  (left  side  of  (3.43))  or  in 
the  flames  2+3  (right  side  of  (3.43))  the  identical  amount  of  heat  is  liberated. 

One  should  keep  in  mind  that  in  many  instances  the  role  of  flame  3  is  small.  In  Ref.  [21]  Beck- 
stead  does  not  consider  its  contribution  into  the  balance  of  heat  on  the  burning  surface,  but  con¬ 
siders  the  effect  on  x*ap through  T*ap  according  to  (3.34,  3.39). 

2.  Expression  (3.31)  contains  parameter  mr,  which  can  be  replaced  using  (3.32)  by  mx  =  mox- 
Sox/ccso.  Let  us  examine  the  derivation  of  expression  for  sox/so.  Convex  or  concave  area  of  the  AP 
particle  is  considered  either  spherical,  see  Fig.  3.2.  Diameters  of  section  of  all  AP  particles  with 
plane  surface  of  binder  are  considered  identical: 

Dc  =  D0a/273  (3.44) 

In  this  case  the  area  sp  ox  of  such  identical  plane  sections  coincides  with  real  area  of  summary  sur¬ 
face,  formed  by  different  sections  by  binder  plane  of  arbitrarily  distributed  in  propellant  AP  parti¬ 
cles.  Start  first  with  calculation  of  relation  sf/  sp  ox  taking  into  account  that  (sf  +  sp  ox)  is  the  area  of 
the  plane  section  of  sample.  Therefore  sections  of  AP  and  binder  are  presented  there  in  the  same 
proportion  as  in  the  bulk  of  propellant  sample,  i.e  sp  ox/(sp  ox+  Sf)  =  £  ,  where  C,  -  relative  volume 
fraction  of  AP.  Then 

sf/spox=(  1/Q-l  (3.45) 

Further,  it  is  known  from  geometry  that  for  the  spherical  segment  the  ratio  of  the  lateral  areas  and 
base  is  equal  to 

sox/sp  0X=l+(2h/Dc)2  (3.46) 

Combing  (3.44),  (3.45)  and  (3.46),  we  finally  obtain 

sox/  s0=C  [  1 +6(h/D0)2]/[  1  +6  ^(h/D0)2] .  (3.47) 

Note,  that  in  the  survey  [19]  the  value  of  in  (3.47)  was  calculated  by  formula  h2  =  0.5  (hi  +  hi) . 
The  meanings  of  h+  and  h.  are  explained  below  (see  formula  3.51). 

3.  For  derivation  of  h/D0  let  us  apply  theorem  about  equality  of  products  of  the  segments  of  inter¬ 
secting  chords  (see  Fig.  3.2): 

(Dc/2)2  =xf(D0-xf),  (3.48) 

D2C  =(2/3)D20,  xf/D0  =0,5(1  ±Vl/3)  (3.49) 

h  =  x j  —  x0X;  Xj  —  Uft, xox  —  ugx( t  —  tjgn  ),  h  —  Xj ( 1  -  u.gx  / Uj  )  +  uoxtjgn  (3.50) 

Here  it  is  assumed  that  when  the  AP  particle  “appears”  at  the  burning  surface,  the  binder  bums 
with  a  constant  linear  velocity  uf  in  the  period  t,  and  AP  bums  with  a  constant  linear  velocity  uox 
Uf  in  the  period  t  -  tign  (tign  -  time  of  AP  ignition).  At  the  moment  in  question  the  diameter  of  the 
“plane”  AP  section  Dc  =  D0V2/3  .  From  (3.47)  and  (3.4)  it  follows 


3—15 


h±/D0=  0.5(1  ±  lV3)(l  -  uox  /  uf )  +  ujign  /  D0  (3.51) 

Ambiguity  of  the  h-values  reflects  the  fact  that  one  and  the  same  magnitude  of  diameter  Dc  can 
be  obtained  by  two  different  sections  of  particle. 

Difference  in  rates  uox  and  Uf  is  used  in  the  model  only  when  finding  h.  For  Uf  it  is  used  the  ex¬ 
pression  of  type  (3.30) 

u j pf  =  Af  exp (~Ef  /  RTS ),  (3.52) 

Note  that  Uf  Pf  in  (3.52)  does  not  coincide  with  mf  (3.32)  because  mf  is  averaged  in  time  value  of 
Uf  Pf  but  (3.51)  and  (3.52)  uses  instantaneous  value  of  Uf  at  the  moment,  when  the  diameter  of  the 
AP  particle  section  with  the  binder  plane  (see  Fig.  3.2)  reaches  the  value  Dc=  D0V2/3  . 

Variation  of  Uf  in  time  is  not  considered  in  the  model.  As  justification  serves  noted  by  the  BDP 
model  authors  weak  dependence  of  calculated  values  of  mx  and  Ts  on  h/D0  and,  consequently,  on 
niox/mf  and  tjgn.  Apparently,  without  large  error  it  might  be  possible  to  assume  h=0,  sox/s0  =  \- 
Specifically,  it  was  made  later  by  Beckstead  in  relay  race  model  [21]  (see  Section  3.5.2). 

4.  Let  us  examine  connection  of  mr  with  the  linear  burning  rate  u.  In  Ref.  [13]  it  was  erroneously 
accepted  mx  =  uppp  where  pp  is  the  density  of  propellant  (in  the  subsequent  versions  of  the  model 
the  error  was  corrected).  Mass  flow  rate  from  the  total  (not  plane)  burning  surface  of  sample  is 
designated  in  [13]  as  s0mT.  On  the  other  hand,  this  quantity  can  be  presented  with  the  utilization 
of  plane  section  (spox+Sf)  of  the  sample: 

s0mT  =(spox  +Sf)  Ppup,  up  =(mx/ pP)So/ (spox+ Xf) 

By  combining  (3.44),  (3.45),  (3.46),  the  relationship  between  up  and  mx  can  be  expressed  as 

up=(mT/pP)[l+3£(h/D0)2]  (3-53) 

After  substitution  in  (3.33)  of  relationships  (3.32),  (3.34-3.37)  and  (3.40)  the  system  of  equations 
(3.30),  (3.33)  becomes  closed  and  can  be  solved  by  the  method  of  iterations.  It  was  accepted  Eox 
=  22  kcal/mol  in  (3.30),  with  Aox  being  selected  in  such  a  way  that  calculation  would  coincide 
with  experimental  data  [22]  on  Ts(p).However,  to  get  agreement  between  calculated  and  experi¬ 
mental  data  on  the  dependence  Ts(p)  became  possible  only  for  small  sizes  of  the  AP  particles.  For 
D0  =  200  |im  the  calculations  gave  underestimated  values  of  Ts  and  m.  As  a  whole,  the  model 
gives  a  good  qualitative  agreement  with  the  experimental  data  on  the  dependencies  of  m  on  p,  To, 
D0,  a. 

In  particular  the  characteristic  (with  bend)  dependence  m(p)  is  obtained,  which  can  he  explained 
as  follows.  At  the  low  pressures,  when  x*pf  <  x*ap  (see  Fig.  3.2),  there  is  only  “natural”  kinetic 
flame  (x*RPF  »  As1ix*dpf).  With  an  increase  in  pressure  the  combustion  changes  into  diffusion 
control  regime  (Ashx*DPF  >  x*RPF).  If  in  this  case  x*PF  <  x*AP,  at  the  curve  m(p)  gently  sloping 
section  or  even  plateau  appears.  Finally,  with  further  pressure  increase  the  inequalities  x*PF  > 
x*ap,  Pf  <  1  will  be  hold  and  at  high  pressures  the  kinetic  flame  2  above  AP  will  become  the 
main  supplier  of  heat  from  the  gas  phase,  and  dependence  m(p)  again  becomes  steeper.  It  is  easy 
to  see  that  for  this  model  the  gently  sloping  section  in  the  curve  m(p)  for  the  coarser  particles  is 
reached  at  lower  pressure  than  for  the  fine  ones.  The  same  reason  causes  the  characteristic  for  the 
models  of  the  BDP  type  dependence  of  value  P  =  9lnm/dT0  on  size  D0  of  AP  particles.  With 
small  D0  in  the  diffusion  regime  P(DC)  =  const;  with  increase  of  D0  the  combustion  behavior 


3—16 


changes,  and  (3(D0)  sharply  increases  in  connection  with  strengthening  of  the  role  of  flames  2  of 
pure  AP  [44].  All  these  conclusions  qualitatively  agree  with  the  experiment. 

3.3.3.  Effect  of  the  local  non-uniformity  of  the  fuel/oxidizer  ratio 

M.  King  [15]  developed  a  combustion  model  on  the  basis  of  the  BDP  model,  by  preserving  idea 
of  competing  flames  and  modifying  almost  all  the  remaining  elements.  Considering  that  the  aver¬ 
aging  “according  to  Hermance”  of  the  parameters  over  the  burning  surface  introduces  the  not  al¬ 
lowing  to  simple  evaluation  error,  he  took  into  account  temporal  changes  in  the  rates  of  the  bum 
out  of  oxidizer  uox  and  adjacent  to  it  binder  Uf. 

In  order  to  be  bounded  to  the  examination  of  a  single  particle,  it  is  necessary  to  make  an  assump¬ 
tion  about  the  ordered  structure  of  the  propellant.  The  bum  out  is  analyzed  of  the  cell  limited  by 
the  planes  of  symmetry  in  the  form  of  parallelepiped  with  dimensions  of  DixO.866DixO.82D].  To 
the  center  of  cell  a  spherical  AP  particle  is  placed  with  diameter  D0  (naturally,  Do<0.82Di).  Re¬ 
maining  space  is  filled  with  binder.  As  in  the  BDP  model,  temperature  Ts  of  the  surface  of  binder 
and  AP  is  considered  identical,  the  surface  of  the  binder  is  plane,  and  surface  of  AP  is  spherical 
(see  Fig.  3.2).  The  mass  burning  rates  of  AP  (at  the  top  of  particle)  and  binder  are  taken  in  the 
form 

mm=A„exp(-E„/KT,)  (3.54) 

in f  =  Af  expip-  Ej  /  R'l  )  (3-55) 

As  in  the  BDP  model,  for  AP  and  binder  the  total  balance  of  heat  is  written  in  the  form  (for  sim¬ 
plification  we  assume  Cf=cox=c): 

m*c{sf  +  spox \TS  -  T0)  =  ~moxsoxQ'ox  -mfsfQ'f  +  q  (3.56) 

m{sf  +spox)=mfsf  +moxsox  (3.57) 

Here  m*  -  total  mass  flow  rate  from  the  burning  surface  of  cell;  q*  -  total  heat  flux  to  this  surface 
from  the  gas  phase;  Qox  and  Qf  -  effective  values  of  heat  of  phase  transitions  with  heat  evolution 
due  to  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  included.  From  equations  (3.54),  (3.55)  and  (3.56)  un¬ 
known  values  Ts,  mox,  mf  are  determined.  In  the  contrast  to  the  BDP  model  for  the  total  mass 
flow  rate  from  the  surface  of  cell  instantaneous  (time  dependent)  value  is  used  according  to 
(3.54),  (3.55)  and  (3.57). 

Let  us  examine  geometry  of  the  SP  surface.  Area  Sf  of  surface  of  fuel  and  area  spox  of  section  of 
AP  by  surface  (plane)  of  fuel  represent  summary  cross-sectional  area  of  cell: 


sf  +  spox  =  0.866 D,2  =  const  (3.58) 

Values  Di  and  Do  are  connected  through  the  AP  volume  fraction: 

C  =  (t tD03  /  6)/(0. 866  •  0. 82  D? )  (3.59) 

As  in  the  BDP  model,  the  following  relationships  are  used  (see  Fig.  3.2) 

s„/sf„  =  U-4(h/Dj  (3.60) 

°,„'k  =  DI/A  =  xi{dc-xi)  (3.61) 

h  =  xf  -  x0X  (3.62) 


whence  follows 


3—17 


(3.63) 


Sox  /  71  =  DqXj  —  2XjXox  +  xox 
sf  =  0.866 Df  -  nxf  (do  -  xf ) 

In  these  relationships  (in  contrast  to  the  BDP  model)  it  is  taken 

Dc=Dc(t)*D0j273 
dxfdt  =  uf  ,  dxox  /  dt  =  uox 

The  delay  time  of  the  particle  ignition  is  not  considered.  At  the  moment  of  arrival  of  the  particle 
apex  to  the  burning  surface  it  is  assumed  t=0  and  Xf  =  x0X  =  0.  In  (3.64)  the  values  Uf  =  m/pf,  uox  = 
nWpojc  should  be  taken  according  to  (3.54)  and  (3.55).  As  the  argument  for  the  numerical  calcu¬ 
lation  it  is  convenient  to  take  xf.  At  each  step  Axi  the  system  of  transcendental  equations  is  solved 
and  all  parameters  of  the  problem  are  determined. 

With  experiment  one  should  compare  the  time  averaged  value  of  m*.  Since  the  model  does  not 
contain  the  mechanism  of  the  bum  out  of  the  binder,  in  the  cases  when  Xf  <  0  and  Xf  >  D0,  for  ob¬ 
taining  the  total  time  of  the  cell  bum  out  artificial  procedures  are  used.  For  example,  the  average 
rate  of  the  bum  out  of  cell  can  be  taken  as  equal  to  the  rate  of  the  bum  out  of  AP  grain. 

The  expressions  for  Q/  Qox',  in  (3.56)  are  given  as  follows 

Q',=GfQf  (3.65) 

Q'ox  -  G0XQl  -  (l  -  Gox )  Qexo  (3 .66) 

Here  Qf  -  heat  of  vaporization  of  binder;  Ql  -  heat  of  dissociative  sublimation  of  AP;  Qexo  - 
thermal  effect  of  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase,  calculated  per  lg  of  AP;  Gf  and  Gox  -  frac¬ 
tions  of  binder  and  oxidizer,  which  are  converted  directly  into  gas  phase,  (1-  Gox)  -  fraction  of 
AP,  which  reacts  in  the  condensed  phase  and  on  the  burning  surface. 

Instead  of  used  in  the  BDP  model  condition  Gox  =  const  the  following  is  used 

1-G«=  }*„(*/"„)  <3-67) 

x=0 

where  Ra  is  the  fraction  of  oxidizer,  which  reacts  in  the  unit  of  time  in  the  condensed  phase;  co¬ 
ordinate  x  =  0  is  selected  on  the  burning  surface,  x  =  x'  corresponds  to  the  beginning  of  the  re¬ 
gion,  where  the  chemical  reaction  can  be  neglected.  According  to  [24], 

R„=B„bexp{-E„b/RT)  (3.68) 

Integral  in  (3.67)  is  calculated  by  iterations,  for  the  first  approximation  the  Michelson  tempera¬ 
ture  profile  is  used.  Products  of  the  AP  sublimation,  which  are  generated  with  the  rate  of  R«,  in¬ 
teract  with  fuel  in  the  stoichiometric  ratio,  so  that  for  Gf  one  has 

(m//m<.X»//i„Xl-G/)/(l-0„)  =  (//<»)««  =«w«  <3-«) 

Let  us  examine  now  derivation  of  expression  for  q*  in  (3.56).  The  “kinetic”  length  x*rpf  of  pri¬ 
mary  flame  stands  for  the  distance  between  the  burning  surface  and  the  beginning  of  this  flame 
(see  Fig.  3.2).  To  facilitate  calculating  the  total  heat  flux  q*  the  real  two-dimensional  picture  (see 
Fig.3.2)  is  substituted  by  the  idealized  one-dimensional  one  (Fig.3.3). 

Assume  that  the  heat  evolution  of  parabolic  diffusion  flame  is  “smeared”  evenly  on  the  layer  with 
thickness  of  s*D  located  above  the  sample  of  SP.  Heat  evolution  from  AP  is  considered  located 


3—18 


within  an  infinitely  thin  layer  at  a  height  x*Ap  above  the  burning  surface  which  is  spread  above 
entire  grain  of  AP.  According  to  the  original  diagram  of  flame  the  inherent  AP  flame  (see  Fig. 
3.2)  becomes  narrow  in  the  vicinity  of  the  top  of  parabolic  diffusion  flame.  Therefore  the  overall 
heat  evolution  in  this  region  is  reduced.  In  the  BDP  model  this  phenomenon  is  considered  by 
multiplier  (3F.  In  King’s  model  (see  Fig.  3.3)  the  area  of  AP  flame  does  not  vary,  but  the  decrease 
of  heat  evolution  is  taken  into  account  by  the  linear  dependence  of  the  intensity  of  heat  evolution 
on  the  unit  area  of  the  AP  flame  on  the  height  above  the  surface  (heat  evolution  becomes  zero 
when  x*ap  =  x*RPF  +  x*D)- 


Fig.  3.3.  Idealized  diagram  of  flames  in  King's  model.  Fig.  3.4.  Distributed  heat  evolution  in

It  is  assumed  that  the  thermal  diagram  in  Fig.  3.3  is  approximately  described  by  one-dimensional 
equation  of  thermal  conductivity

(3.70) 


In  line  with  the  assumptions  made  the  graph  Q(x)  takes  the  form,  depicted  in  Fig.  3.4.  By  broken 
lines  the  heat  evolution  of  the  AP  flame  for  other  two  values  x*AP  is  marked. 


Solving  (3.70),  where  one  should  take  Q(x)  in  accordance  to  Fig.  3.4,  it  is  possible  to  obtain 

M^T/dx)^  _  1  - e~Z2Ae'[z2ez^Z2  - (l - )]

Here  A0'  is  the  relative  heat  evolution  in  the  AP  flame;  multiplier  Z3/Z2  considers  the  dependence 
mentioned  above  on  the  position  of  AP  flame;  QAP  is  the  heat  evolution  in  the  flame  of  AP  as 
monofuel;  Gox<l  since  part  of  AP  is  consumed  during  decomposition  in  the  solid  phase.  Using 
(3.71)  it  is  possible  to  calculate  heat  flux  qf  to  the  binder,  and  when  assuming  in  (3.71)  A©'=0,  to 
calculate  heat  flux  qox  coming  to  AP.  Finally,  one  obtains 

4  =Spox<lox+Sfqf  (3-72) 


3—19 


For  "kinetic"  length  (standoff)  distances  x*Apf  and  x*AP  actually  the  same  expressions  are  used, 
as  in  the  BDP  model.  Upon  the  calculation  of  the  height  x*d  of  diffusion  flame,  by  x*d  is  in¬ 
tended  the  distance,  at  which  the  reaction  proceeds  up  to  90%.  With  such  determination  the  value 
x*d  can  be  computed  even  with  the  stoichiometric  ratio  of  the  components  in  SP,  when  the  height 
of  determined  by  the  traditional  method  (see  Section  3.4.2)  diffusion  flame  becomes  infinite. 
Height  x*d  can  be  found  numerically  from  formula  (3.97),  which  contains  also  parameter  v  = 
<Dc2/(1-c2),  where  Or  =  l/d>  is  the  mass  ratio  (ox/f)  in  gasification  products,  divided  by  the  appro¬ 
priate  stoichiometric  ratio.  As  a  rule,  in  typical  SP  aT  <  1  although,  for  example,  at  the  moment 
of  the  passage  of  maximum  m0Xs0X/mfSf  during  the  bum  out  of  cell,  in  the  model  in  question  it  is 
possible  to  get  ax>l. 

Upon  calculating  aj  it  is  taking  into  account  in  [15]  (by  multipliers  Gf  and  Gox)  the  depletion  of 
reagents  in  the  reaction  between  oxidizer  and  fuel  under  the  burning  surface.  The  expression  for 
ax  is  as  follows 

aT  =  1  /  $  =  (/  /  ox)stoich  {supG)0X  /(. supG ) f  (3 .73) 

During  the  time  of  the  bum  out  of  cell,  the  value  of  ax  substantially  varies. 

In  the  model,  it  is  proposed  to  consider  decomposed  as  oxidizer  and  fuel  not  entire  content  of  AP 
and  binder,  but  to  consider  part  of  the  products  of  their  decomposition  inert.  In  particular,  the  AP 
particles  were  treated  as  consisted  of  oxidizer  by  96%,  and  binder  as  consisted  of  the  fuel  by 
28%.  It  was  reported  in  [15]  that  after  appropriate  selection  of  the  coefficients  the  model  agrees 
well  with  experiment  on  combustion  of  SP  based  on  AP  (size  of  particles  5,  20,  200  pm)  and  hy¬ 
droxyl  terminated  polybutadiene  binder  (HTPB). 

3.3.4.  “Petite  ensemble”  model 

To  take  into  account  a  local  transience  of  heterogeneous  system  combustion  is  possible  not  only 
by  examining  variation  in  time  of  the  process  in  the  vicinity  of  a  single  chosen  particle  of  oxi¬ 
dizer  (as  this  is  done  in  King’s  model),  but  also  examining  instantaneous  picture  of  combustion  of 
entire  sample,  i.e.  spatial  distribution  of  the  parameters  at  a  fixed  moment  of  time.  If  King’s  ap¬ 
proach  is  compared  with  the  survey  of  the  motion-picture  film  about  the  fate  of  single  particle  of 
oxidizer,  then  it  is  appropriate  to  compare  alternative  approach  with  investigation  of  an  instanta¬ 
neous  photograph  of  the  surface  of  the  burning  sample.  The  idea  about  the  processes  on  the  sur¬ 
face  can  be  obtained  from  the  examination  of  a  group  of  particles,  if  corresponding  to  these  parti¬ 
cles  frames  form  the  mentioned  film.  This  group  can  prove  to  be  relatively  small. 

Attempt  to  realize  described  approach  was  made  in  the  “Petite  ensemble”  model  [14].  Let  us  list 
coincidences  and  differences  in  the  elements  of  this  model  and  BDP  model.  As  in  the  BDP 
model,  the  surface  temperature  Ts  is  considered  as  identical  in  every  point  of  the  surface,  the  sur¬ 
face  of  binder  -  plane,  the  surface  of  oxidizer,  contacting  with  gas  -  spherical.  Upon  calculation 
of  the  shape  of  this  surface  the  burning  rates  of  oxidizer  and  binder  uox  and  Uf  are  considered  con¬ 
stant,  the  dependence  of  the  ignition  time  tign  on  the  diameter  of  the  oxidizer  particle  is  neglected. 
The  height  of  the  flame  above  the  surface  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  solution  of  Burke- 
Schumann.  The  basic  relationships  of  the  BDP  model,  written  in  the  form  (3.30)  -(3.32),  are 
used. 


3—20 


However,  calculation  of  the  burning  rate  using  these  relationships  is  made  with  specifically  de¬ 
termined  values  of  spox,  sox,  s0,  x*ap  and  x*PF.  According  to  Ref.  14  the  averaging  of  the  cross- 
sectional  areas  of  the  AP  particles  is  conducted  among  the  particles,  which  have  been  already  ig¬ 
nited.  The  AP  burning  surface  is  calculated  by  separate  averaging.  If  particle  bums  out  relatively 
fast,  before  its  “cold”  (bottom)  end  is  reached  by  the  combustion  front  of  binder,  it  is  assumed  for 
maintaining  the  quasi-planarity  of  the  propellant  burning  surface  that  the  generating  recess  is  in¬ 
stantly  filled  with  the  melt  of  binder.  And  vice  versa,  if  particle  did  not  bum  out  completely  up  to 
this  moment,  then  it  flies  away.  In  this  case  the  change  of  the  f/ox  ratio  in  the  gases,  leaving  the 
burning  surface,  is  considered  as  well  as  corresponding  change  in  the  temperature  of  flame.  Upon 
calculation  of  the  height  of  the  diffusion  flame  several  terms  of  series  in  the  solution  of  Burke  - 
Schumann  are  considered. 

Let  as  give  example  of  derivation  of  expression  for  sox  and  spox.  For  calculation  sox  let  us  find  ini¬ 
tially  the  burning  surface  of  one  particle.  If  after  the  arrival  of  AP  particle  to  the  propellant  sur¬ 
face  the  binder  around  particle  is  bumed-out  on  Xf,  with  particle  burning  out  itself  to  x0X,  then 

sox  (•*■/ ) =  ^D0xf  —  2xfx„  +  xox )  (3.74) 

(just  the  same  as  .above  in  King's  model  equation  3.63).  Assuming  at  the  moment  of  arrival  of 
particle  to  the  propellant  surface  t=0  and  Xf=0,  we  have 
Xf=uft,  xox=  uox  (t  -  tign  )=(xf  -  xign  )uox  /  uf  ,  xign  =  uftign . 

Here  tign  is  the  time  of  the  particle  ignition.  Then  (3.74)  takes  the  form 

Jar  (*f )/ 71  =  x)  co(o)  ■ -  2)  +  xf  [do  +  2o)(l  -  0j)xign  ]  +  (mign  )2 ,  ?5) 

(£>=Uox/llf 

On  the  burning  surface  with  random  particle  distribution  there  are  located  AP  particles  with  dif¬ 
ferent  Xf.  In  this  case  for  burning  particles  Xf  varies  from  Xign  to  xmax  =  min(Do,  xcr),  xcr=Xjgn+Do/cD. 
If  xcr  >  Do,  the  particle  on  the  surface  is  not  able  to  bum  out  and  flies  away,  when  Xf  =  xmax  =  Do. 
If  xcr  <  D0  the  particle  bums,  completely  on  the  surface,  leaving  after  burning  a  pit  (King  exam¬ 
ines  only  this  case). 

Therefore  the  total  area  of  the  burning  AP  particles  is 

(3.76) 

xign 

Here  dN  -  number  of  AP  particles  on  the  surface  with  the  centers  of  these  particles  being  located 
from  the  surface  at  a  distance  (0.5Do-  Xf)  in  the  zone  with  a  thickness  of  dxf.  With  area  of  the 
cross  section  of  the  sample  sp  the  volume  of  that  zone  equals  spdxf  and  since  in  the  propellant 
with  the  volume  fraction  of  AP  equals  £,  the  concentration  of  the  centers  of  particles  is  t, 
/(7tD03/6)  and  the  number  of  particles  in  this  layer  is 

dN  =  spdxf  C  /(nDo  / 6)  (3.77) 

From  (3.75)-(3.77)  it  follows 

(sox/sp)/^  =  0)(w-2)(x3  -X,3)+3[2co(l  +  (o)x,.  +l]x 

x  (Xm  ~  X? )  +  6(g)X,  )2  (%m  ~  X, )  >  (3.78) 

Xm=xmax/D0,  Xt=xign/D0 


3—21 


Let  us  analogously  find  entering  in  (3.47)  total  cross-sectional  area  of  ignited  particles,  which  are 
cut  with  plane  of  fuel 

spw=]sp*c(xf)dN  (3J9) 

Here  sp0X(xf)  =  7tXf(Do  -  Xf)  (see  presented  above  models  of  BDP  and  King),  dN  should  be  taken 
according  to  (3.77).  Then  we  find 

(v* ' SP V c  =  ixl  -%?)- 2Um  - x- )  (3-80) 

In  the  particular  case  xlgn  =  0,  Xmax  =  D0,  when  the  surface  of  binder  remains  plane,  from  (3.80)  it 
follows  common  relationship  spox  =  Csp- 

As  in  the  BDP  model,  the  terms  corresponding  to  heat  evolution  in  flame  are  calculated  in  bal¬ 
ance  of  heat  for  certain  average  size  of  AP  particle  section,  namely,  for  arithmetic  mean  value  of 
cross-sectional  areas  of  ignited  particles.  Obviously,  for  its  finding  it  is  necessary  the  value  spox 
from  (3.80)  to  divide  by  the  total  number  of  the  ignited  particles  Ni^: 

N„,  =  JdN  =  <»,(£/* D’)fe.  -X  J  (3.81) 

xiSn 

Further,  for  the  mean  cross-sectional  area  of  particle  we  obtain 

(it/ 4 W„  =  /N„,  =  (ltD02 /ejtfc  -X?)-2fc,  ~x’)]/(x„  )  (3-82) 

In  the  particular  case,  when  Xign=  0,  xmax=  Do,  this  gives,  D2  =  (2 / 3)D2 . 

For  calculating  parameters  of  the  diffusion  flame  it  is  necessary  to  know  effective  external  radius 
b  of  the  fuel  stream,  which  surrounds  stream  of  oxidizer.  Authors  of  Ref.  [14]  assume  that  the 
fuel  on  the  propellant  surface  is  divided  into  equal  parts  between  all  being  present  on  it  particles 
of  AP,  including  those  not  ignited.  One  may  obtain  total  number  of  particles  on  the  flat  surface, 
assuming  in  (3.81)  Xjgn=  0  and  xmax=  Do 

N  =  6C,sp  /(tcDq  )  (3.83) 

Total  surface  of  fuel  Sf=  sp(l-Q,  and  surface  per  one  particle  is 

A sf  =  sf  / N  =  (1-  C)(ttD02  /6C)  (3.84) 

For  the  stream  with  an  effective  radius  b  we  have 

nb2  =  Asf  +{n/4)D2gn  (3.85) 

In  the  case  when  xmax=  D0  i.e.  when  incompletely  burned  particles  fly  away  from  the  surface,  in 
relationships  (3.84)  and  (3.85)  instead  of  £  the  value  is  used,  which  considers  a  change  in  the 
components  ratio  due  to  the  carry-off  of  the  solid  oxidizer. 

The  balance  of  heat  and  calculation  of  the  flame  temperature  are  considered  with  account  of  the 
effect  of  carry-off  of  oxidizer.  Size  of  remaining  AP  grains  is  h  =  Xf  -  x0X=  Xf(l-to)+XignCO  at  Xf  = 
Do  (if  in  this  case  h>0).  Then  mass  a'  and  volume  fractions  of  the  consumed  in  the  condensed 
phase  oxidizer  are  as  follows 

a7a=C’/C  =  l  ~{h(D0)/Dj  (3.86) 

In  this  case  for  the  oxidizer  remaining  on  the  surface  one  has 


3—22 


a'mTsp  =  moxsox, 

where  sox  -  surface  of  burning  AP  according  to  (3.78). 

Calculations,  carried  out  on  the  “petite  ensemble”  model  in  a  wide  range  of  variation  of  different 
parameters,  gave  results  sufficiently  close  to  the  results  of  calculations  according  to  the  BDP 
model.  Greatest  deviation  of  the  results  of  calculations  from  that  by  the  BDP  model  gave  an  ap¬ 
plication  of  formula  (3.82)  for  effective  size  of  the  AP  particle  section.  We  give  according  to  Ref. 
[19]  relative  change  in  the  calculated  burning  rate  (in  comparison  with  the  BDP  model)  caused  by 
the  differences  in  the  procedure  of  averaging.  Calculation  was  carried  out  with  the  values  of  the 
parameters  a,  D0  typical  for  the  SP  combustion.

3.3.5.  Account  of  difference  in  the  temperature  of  oxidizer  and  fuel  at  the  burning  surface 

In  UTD-models  presented  above  an  assumption  about  equality  of  the  temperatures  Ts  and  Tsf  of 
oxidizer  and  fuel  on  the  burning  surface  was  essentially  used.  At  the  same  time  there  are  experi¬ 
mental  data,  according  to  which  Ts  and  Tsf  can  noticeably  be  distinguished  ([23],  see  also  Section 
3.5).  Another  weak  point  in  the  models  with  the  uniform  temperature  distribution,  based  on  the 
concepts  of  BDP,  is  the  complete  absence  of  the  heat  supply  into  the  binder  from  the  gas  phase  in 
the  case  when  diffusion  flame  hangs  above  the  binder.  An  attempt  to  eliminate  these  two  defi¬ 
ciencies  in  the  models  of  the  BDP  type  has  been  undertaken  in  Ref.  [16],  after  developing  the  ap¬ 
proach,  which  was  conditionally  named  "improved  model”. 

For  describing  combustion  of  oxidizer  AP  a  simplified  version  of  the  BDP  model  was  used.  The 
corresponding  equations  take  the  form: 

mox  =  Aox  eXP  Eox  /  RTs) 

Cs{Ts-To)+AHs+Ql=  (337) 

=  Pox  [{Pf  /  ®)Qpf  exp(-  Cpf  )  +  (l  -  )Qox  exp(-  £* )], 

Qox  =  Pp  ]p,  (Tox  -  298)  -  cs  (r0  -  298)  +  A Hev  J, 

Ql=Qox-Qf ,  Qf=cs{Tox-29S)-cs{T0-29S)  +  AHs, 
mox  (l  ~Pp)=As  exp(-  Es  /  RTS ) 

Here  Pp=l-|3s  is  the  AP  fraction  which  is  decomposed  in  the  gas  phase.  Multiplier  (30x  <  1  consid¬ 
ers  that  the  part  of  the  heat  is  transferred  into  the  fuel,  even  if  the  flame  is  located  only  above  the 
oxidizer. 


As  in  the  BDP  model,  value  (3F  indicates  the  fraction  of  AP  located  under  the  primary  flame;  a  - 
mass  fraction  of  AP  in  the  propellant. 


The  process  of  the  fuel  pyrolysis  is  described  by  equations 

mf  =  Af  exp[-  Ef  / RTsf ), 


Cf{Tsf  T0)+Qf  -  (l  Pat)  1  exp{  £ PFf  ) 


(3.88) 


3—23 


Experimental  values  of  Af  and  Ef  for  different  binders  are  taken  from  [23]  (see  Section  3.5.1). 
The  dimensionless  height  ^PFf  of  flame  above  the  binder  does  not  coincide  with  the  height  ^pf  of 
the  flame  above  AP:

Here  the  first  terms  in  the  parentheses  represent  the  “diffusion  height"  and  the  second  terms  - 
the  "kinetic  height"  of  the  flame  (compare  with  3.36  and  3.37).  The  value  of  the  coefficient  Bfl, 
in  (3.89)  is  accepted  as  Bfh  =  Ash/8.  Because  of  the  multiplier  1/8  in  the  second  equality  (3.89) 
the  first  term  in  the  parenthesis  has  smaller  weight  than  in  the  first  equality.  The  examination 
of  the  calculated  form  of  flame,  obtained  from  the  solution  of  Burke-Schumman  [27]  (Fig. 
3.5a),  has  given  a  basis  for  the  introduction  of  multiplier  1/8.  This  multiplier  taken  into  ac¬ 
count  the  low  height  of  "hanging"  above  the  fuel  part  of  the  flame  near  its  base.  In  the  original 
BDP  model  -with  the  excess  of  fuel,  typical  for  SP,  it  was  accepted  that  the  heat  flux  from  the 
gas  enters  only  into  the  oxidizer,  but  according  to  the  equation  of  the  total  balance  of  heat 
(2.31)  the  part  of  the  heat  feedback  is  expended  on  heating  and  vaporizing  the  fuel  (heat  ex¬ 
change  occurs  through  the  condensed  phase). 


Mass  flows  of  oxidizer  and  fuel  are  connected  with  relationship 

m0XScx  / mfsf  =  «(!  -  a)  (3-9°) 

This  relationship  makes  it  possible  to  determine  during  the  solution  of  entire  system  of  equa¬ 
tions  the  value  of  the  coefficient  pox  describing  distribution  of  heat  feedback  from  the  gas  be¬ 
tween  the  fuel  and  oxidizer.  Areas  sox,  sf  and  entire  geometry  of  the  burning  surface  are  taken 
according  to  the  BDP  model.

symmetric  flame. 

The  model  was  checked  by  calculations  for  conditions  of  experiment,  described  in  Ref.  [15] 
(propellant  AP  +  polybutadiene  binder,  a  =  0.73  and  0.77;  D0  =  5,  20,  200  pm;  p  =  7...  120 
atm),  and  showed  fair  agreement  with  experiment  in  the  whole  range  of  pressures  and  AP 
grain  sizes.

3.3.6.  Critical  discussion  of  the  UTD-models 

1.  When  using  UTD-models,  a  typical  shortcoming  consists  in  their  incorrect  application  with 
oxidizer  particle  size  D0>k/u.  Let  us  show  this  mistake  on  the  example  of  the  BPD  model.  We 
will  examine  the  balance  of  heat  (3.31)  for  the  real  nonhomogeneous  surface  of  SP.  Thus  far 
the  thickness  of  the  preheated  layer  in  the  condensed  phase  is  more  than  the  size  of  heteroge¬ 
neity  (k/u>D0),  such  form  of  equation  is  justified,  since  the  redistribution  occurs  in  the  bulk  of 
a  preheated  layer  of  nonuniform  heat  flux  entering  from  the  surface.  But  with  an  increase  in 
the  size  of  AP  particles  (with  p  =  const)  the  picture  of  heat  exchange  changes  and  global  aver¬ 
aging  becomes  meaningless,  since  its  physical  basis  is  absent,  namely,  redistribution  of  heat 
flux  from  the  surface.  Oxidizer  and  binder  start  to  bum  “individually”,  this  leads  to  the  bend¬ 
ing  of  surface.  With  a  very  large  difference  in  the  rates  of  the  oxidizer  and  binder  bum  out  (SP 
with  nitramines  or  with  AP  at  elevated  pressures,  see  also  the  “sequential”  model  of  Beck- 
stead,  Section  3.5.2)  the  form  of  dependence  m(p)  can  be  determined  by  the  slowly  burning 
component  (binder).  Consequently,  the  used  in  the  BDP  model  assumption  that  the  burning 
rate  of  SP  is  determined  by  the  burning  rate  of  combustion  of  AP,  with  D0  >  k/u  can  lead  to  the 
erroneous  conclusions. 

In  Ref.  [19],  the  attention  was  focused  on  sharply  underestimated  in  comparison  with  experi¬ 
ment,  values  of  the  rate  of  combustion,  which  give  calculations  the  BDP  model  for  propellant 
with  coarse  AP  particles  (for  example,  200  pm).  This  fact  was  also  noted  by  the  authors  of  the 
BDP  model.  Modification  of  BDP  model  proposed  in  Ref.  [19]  for  the  propellant  with  the 
polybutadiene  binder  exhibited  a  good  agreement  with  experiment  in  the  case  of  AP  particles 
size  5  and  20  pm  but  computed  more  than  twice  lowered  in  comparison  with  experiment 
burning  rate  in  the  case  of  the  particles  with  size  of  200  pm.  The  same  has  been  demonstrated 
for  this  propellant  by  “unsteady”  model  of  King  [15],  also  based  on  the  BDP  model.  King  cor¬ 
related  better  theory  with  experiment  by  using  selected  values  of  the  coefficients,  with  which 
the  heat  liberation  in  the  solid  phase  depended  on  pressure.  As  it  was  stated  in  Ref.  19,  this 
way  can  be  considered  as  correct.  Assuming  that  for  coarse  AP  particles  the  inherent  flame  of 
AP  becomes  the  main  supplier  of  heat  from  the  gas  phase  (since  there  is  reduced  portion  Pf  of 
AP,  which  bums  in  the  primary  flame),  it  is  proposed  [19]  to  improve  the  model  of  AP  com¬ 
bustion  by  considering  completely  probable  the  dependence  of  heat  evolution,  mentioned 
above,  on  the  pressure.  At  the  same  time,  according  to  experimental  data  [20],  in  the  pressure 
range  of  20-100  atm)  this  dependence  is  absent  (see  also  Section  1.4.2). 

However,  noted  above  disagreement  between  theory  and  experiment  can  be  explained  in  an¬ 
other  way.  Let  us  discuss  theoretical  and  experimental  data  presented  in  Table  3.1.

It  is  known  that  polysulfide  propellant  “is  hot”,  the  temperature  of  flame  Tf  =  2545K  [13,  23]. 
The  heat  feedback  from  the  gas  goes  to  the  coarse  (D0  =  200  pm)  AP  crystals  mainly  from  the 
inherent  flame,  and  they  have  to  bum  with  actual  rate  of  ~0.3  cm/s.  Hot  primary  flame  heats 
up  only  part  of  binder  and  the  thin  zone  of  AP  adjacent  to  the  binder  layer.  With  k/u  <  Do,  it  is 
possible  to  disregard  heat  exchange  between  this  region  and  the  bulk  of  the  crystal  of  AP. 

In  this  case  one  may  expect  the  higher  rate  of  AP  bum  out,  which  is  confirmed  by  visual  ob¬ 
servations  [17]  of  extinguished  surface  of  the  polysulfide  formulation:  at  p  =  20  atm  the  ma¬ 
jority  of  AP  crystals  protrudes  above  SP  surface.  Apparently,  obtained  in  the  experiment  the 
burning  rate  of  polysulfide  propellant,  equal  to  0.5  cm/s,  is  close  to  the  average  burning  rate  of 
the  sections,  situated  under  the  primary  flame. 

At  the  same  time  the  calculations  [13]  that  considered,  as  in  the  BDP  model,  the  rate  control 
role  of  AP  gave  0.3  cm/s.  Why  this  result  was  obtained,  it  is  easy  to  comprehend  by  examining 
the  balance  of  heat  (3.31).  For  coarse  AP  crystals  Pf«  1,  and  in  the  total  balance  heat  feed¬ 
back  from  the  primary  flame  can  be  neglected.  The  portion  of  the  heat,  which  enters  from  the 
diffusion  flame,  due  to  the  high  value  of  the  stand  off  distance  flame  x*ff  ~  D2  is  also  low. 
Thus,  binder  is  presented  in  (3.31)  only  by  the  term  (msQ)f.  In  calculation  in  question  authors 
of  [13]  used  for  Qf  a  value  of  50  cal/g,  which  is  10  times  less  than  the  value,  found  experi¬ 
mentally  in  the  later  work  [12],  Therefore  term  (msQ)f  proved  to  be  low,  and  the  heat  balance 
(3.31)  actually  coincided  with  the  balance  for  pure  AP.  Naturally,  the  calculation  gave  u  =  uox 
=  0.3  cm/s. 


Let  we  discuss  another  example.  Polybutadiene  propellant  is  ’’cold”:  according  to  Ref.  [23], 
with  a  =  0.7  the  value  Tf  =  1450K.  In  the  more  accurate  examination  it  is  necessary  to  take 
into  account  that  Tf  ~  1450K  is  the  mean  temperature  of  products,  and  the  primary  flame  is 
hotter.  However,  with  such  high  values  of  the  f/ox  ratio  (~  1 .4)  it  is  shifted  from  the  interface  to 
the  side  of  oxidizer,  and  binder  obtains  little  heat  (see  comments  on  the  solution  of  Burke  - 
Schumann  in  Section  3.4.2).  Apparently,  in  this  case  the  rate  of  the  bum  out  of  binder  is 
somewhat  less  than  the  burning  rate  of  AP,  or  it  is  close  to  it.  The  latter  determines  overall  rate 
of  SP  combustion  r~0.3  cm/s  observed  in  the  experiment. 

In  calculation  performed  in  accordance  with  the  BDP  model  in  the  balance  of  heat  (3.31)  it  is 
possible,  as  before,  to  neglect  by  heat  feedback  from  the  primary  and  diffusion  flames,  but  it  is 
necessary  to  consider  heat  expenditure  for  vaporization  of  binder  (msQ)f,  where  Qf  =  433  cal/g 
[23].  Part  of  these  heat  losses,  according  to  the  model,  falls  on  AP,  lowering  thus  the  tem¬ 
perature  of  its  surface  and  rate  of  combustion,  and  consequently,  overall  burning  rate.  It  is  no 
surprising  therefore  that  calculation  gave  value  of  u  =  0.15  cm/s,  i.e.-  much  less  than  it  was 
obtained  in  the  experiment. 

Thus,  in  two  cases  examined  above  the  disagreement  between  calculation  and  experiment  for 
formulations  with  coarse  AP  particles  can  be  explained  not  by  variation  of  fraction  G  of  oxi¬ 
dizer,  which  is  decomposed  in  the  condensed  phase,  as  it  was  proposed  in  Ref.  19,  but  by  the 
fact  that  for  coarse  AP  particles  assumptions  placed  into  model  about  redistribution  of  heat 
within  a  preheated  layer  and  about  rate  control  role  of  AP  decomposition  are  not  met.

2.  Ignoring  or  insufficient  account  of  local  non-uniform  and  transient  combustion  behavior, 
caused  by  heterogeneity  of  heat  release,  is  an  overall  deficiency  in  known  today  UTD-models 
and  as  a  whole  all  models  of  combustion  of  heterogeneous  SP. 

Thus,  in  Hermance’s  model  the  gas  flame  above  surface  of  SP  is  considered  plane,  i.e.  non- 
uniform  character  of  heat  release  is  excluded  completely.  In  the  BDP  model  and  in  all  based 
on  it  models  the  heterogeneity  in  the  gas  phase  is  considered  by  the  bending  of  flame  accord¬ 
ing  to  the  solution  of  Burke-Schumann.  However,  boundary  conditions,  for  which  solution 
[27]  and  its  modification  [19]  were  obtained,  do  not  completely  correspond  to  the  SP  combus¬ 
tion,  that  in  many  instances  can  substantially  influence  the  results  (about  this  in  detail  see  in 
Section  3.4.2).  Furthermore,  the  form  of  flame  obtained  by  the  solution  of  Burke-  Schumann  is 
usually  oversimplified:  the  bent  flame  is  substituted  by  the  equivalent  (equal  to  the  total  heat 
flux  in  SP)  flat  flame.  In  this  case  a  possibility  is  lost  to  calculate  heat  flux  from  the  gas  to  the 
hinder  for  the  case,  when  flame  is  located  strictly  above  the  crystal  of  oxidizer. 

In  connection  with  above  mentioned  the  attempts  to  make  more  precise  version  of  the  Burke- 
Schumann  solution  with  retention  of  mentioned  crude  assumptions  are  useless.  Nevertheless 
such  attempts  are  undertaken  in  a  series  of  works.  Thus,  in  the  petite  ensemble  model  [14]  the 
increased  number  of  terms  of  series  is  taken  in  the  solution  of  Burke-Schumann.  In  King's 
model  [15]  localized  above  oxidizer  infinitely  thin  curved  flame  is  substituted  without  reason¬ 
able  basis  by  the  flat  flame  of  finite  thickness  above  the  selected  cell  of  propellant  (oxidizer  + 
binder). 

Finally,  in  improved  combustion  model  [16]  the  author’s  combine  a  detailed  description  of  the 
form  of  flame  according  to  Burke-Schumann  with  the  rough  simplification  of  this  form:  in  or¬ 
der  to  calculate  the  heat  flux  into  the  binder  for  the  case,  when  diffusion  flame  is  closed  above 
the  oxidizer,  they  consider  the  partial  overhang  of  this  flame  above  the  binder  according  to 
Fig.  3.5a. 

In  the  BDP  model  such  specific  details  were  not  considered,  binder  in  this  situation  obtained 
the  heat  necessary  for  the  gasification  directly  from  the  oxidizer  by  thermal  conductivity 
through  the  condensed  phase.  In  model  [16]  there  is  no  such  way,  since  for  the  oxidizer  and 
the  binder  the  separate  balances  of  heat  are  written,  without  interaction  within  condensed 
phase.  Therefore  an  attempt  was  made  to  take  into  account  some  heat  feedback  from  the  gas 
phase,  with  reference  to  the  form  of  the  flame.  This  reference,  however,  was  incorrect:  ac¬ 
cording  to  Ref.  [27],  Fig.  3.5a  relates  to  the  flat  flame  burner,  and  for  the  cylindrical  burner 
simulating  combustion  of  SP  Fig.  3.5b  is  given  in  [27]  without  the  overhang  of  the  flame  base 
above  the  peripheral  part. 

In  models  examined  gas-dynamic  non-uniform  behavior,  caused  by  curvature  of  burning  sur¬ 
face  is  not  considered,  the  need  for  this  account  was  discussed  by  the  Soviet  authors  even  in 
the  60's,  when  the  terms  "frozen  turbulence"  and  "permanent  transience"  [25,  43]  were  intro¬ 
duced. 


3—27 


The  account  of  peripheral  component  of  velocity  of  gas  near  the  surface  of  SP  might  give  pos¬ 
sibility,  for  example,  to  calculate  convection  heat  transfer  to  the  binder  for  the  case,  when 
flame  is  closed  above  the  crystal  of  oxidizer. 

3.  Account  of  transience  is  closely  related  to  the  correctness  of  averaging  upon  calculation  of 
mass  burning  rate  m.  If  we  come  back  to  analogy  with  movie  film  about  the  life  of  single  par¬ 
ticle  (see  the  beginning  of  Section  3.3.4),  then  one  may  state  that  in  all  UTD-models,  except 
King's  model,  one  frozen  frame  of  mentioned  film  is  examined  only,  and  information,  which  is 
contained  in  remaining  frames,  in  no  way  is  used.  In  this  particular  case  the  burning  rate  is  cal¬ 
culated  of  the  sample,  on  the  surface  of  which  all  particles  with  different  residence  time  are 
substituted  to  the  identical,  that  correspond  to  the  selected  frame,  i.e.,  to  the  specific  residence 
time  on  the  surface. 

In  models  of  Hermance,  BDP  and  “improved  model”  as  such  chosen  particle  the  one  is  used 
with  diameter  of  section  Dc  =  D0  2/3.  In  this  case  as  a  result  of  the  averaging  the  summary  area 
of  the  plane  sections  of  particles  on  the  surface  of  sample  is  retained.  There  is  no,  however, 
evidence  for  considering  that  simultaneously  the  summary  heat  flux  into  the  sample  is  re¬ 
tained,  provided  that  the  flux  from  each  particle  is  not  proportional  to  the  area  of  its  section, 
i.e.,  ~D  c. 

Neither  in  the  model  of  Hermance  nor  in  the  BDP  model  there  is  no  such  proportionality.  It 
should  be  noted  a  certain  inconsistency,  which  was  shown  upon  the  development  of  the  model 
of  Hermance.  Introduced  in  it  the  averaging  of  heat  flux  into  the  sample  in  accordance  with  the 
particle  sizes  for  the  polydisperse  composition  (see  Chapter  4)  can  be  naturally  spread,  for  any 
composition  (including  monodisperse  one)  if  one  average  the  heat  fluxes,  according  to  sizes  of 
the  particle  sections  with  the  plane  of  binder.  However,  Hermance’ s  model  in  the  case  of  uni- 
modal  composition  averages  section  of  the  particles  but  not  heat  fluxes  from  them  into  the 
sample. 

Authors  of  the  BDP  model  noncritically  adopted  this  methodology,  although  in  their  model  it 
can  lead  to  more  serious  errors  in  view  of  strong  (exponential)  dependence  of  heat  flux  from 
gas  phase  on  Dc.  As  far  as  the  “improved  model”  [16]  is  concerned,  upon  the  calculation  of 
heat  flux  into  the  sample,  besides  the  noted  deficiency  in  all  models  of  the  BDP  type,  it  in¬ 
volves  new  one:  there  is  no  serious  background  for  using  separate  heat  balances  for  the  oxi¬ 
dizer  and  binder,  while  it  is  not  considered  the  heat  exchange  between  them  by  thermal  con¬ 
ductivity  through  condensed  phase.  As  it  was  already  noted  above,  to  use  “one-dimensional” 
balance  of  heat  in  the  condensed  phase  is  possible  only  for  UTD-models  under  condition  D0  < 
k/u.  It  is  clear  that  the  inter-component  heat  exchange  in  this  case  is  unavoidable. 

Let  us  describe  an  approach  for  more  correct  averaging  the  heat  flux  over  the  surface  to  derive 
balance  of  heat  (3.31).  Let  we  designate  through  f(D)  the  heat  flux,  obtained  from  the  gas 
phase  by  particle  (with  diameter  of  section  D  by  the  plane  surface  of  the  binder)  and  “at¬ 
tached"  to  it  binder.  The  total  flux  to  the  surface  of  sample  is  equal  to  J  /(  D  )dN  .  Let  us  in¬ 
troduce  now  the  shift  y  of  the  center  of  particle  relative  to  the  surface  of  SP.  On  the  surface, 
the  particles  are  located,  for  which  |y|<D0/2.  Their  total  number  according  to  (3.83)  equal

No=CDoSp/(7tDo3/6)  and  the  number  of  particles  with  the  centers  in  the  layer  by  comprises  dN  = 
Nody/D0.  From  Fig.  2.2  it  follows  (2y)2+D2=Lo2  then

In  the  petite  ensemble  model  instead  of  Dc  =  D0 -s/2/3  as  the  effective  the  diameter  is  taken 

such  one,  which  upon  the  replacement  of  all  particles  on  the  sample  surface  by  the  "effective" 
particle  with  given  diameter  ensures  the  retention  of  summary  cross-sectional  area  of  the  ig¬ 
nited  particles.  In  a  certain  sense  this  selection  of  the  effective  diameter  of  the  section  of  parti¬ 
cle  takes  into  account  the  unsteady  effects  (ignition)  on  the  surface.  However,  only  the  total 
cross-sectional  area  of  the  burning  particles  is  determined  accurately  in  this  case,  but  not  the 
connected  with  them  mean  heat  flux.  These  calculations  can  be  made  more  precise.  Note,  that 
according  to  the  model,  it  should  be  considered  the  presence  on  the  surface  of  the  non-ignited 
particles  and  empty  places  (pits)  after  the  bum  out  of  ignited  particles.  In  other  words,  in  the 
petite  ensemble  model  the  connected  to  the  given  particle  heat  flux  depends  on  the  section  of 
particle  D,  an  it  is  more  correct  to  take  it  in  the  form  f(D(y))=  fi(y),  so  that  instead  of  (3.91)

If  one  calculates  only  heat  flux  from  the  gas  and  does  not  consider  it  in  the  cases  of  non-

Here  yign  is  the  height  of  the  apex  of  the  particle  above  the  surface  of  binder  at  the  moment  of 
ignition,  and  ymax  can  be  less  than  Do/2,  if  particle  sufficiently  rapidly  bums  out  and  leaves  a 
pit. 

Let  us  note  additional  difficulty  connected  with  averaging  of  the  heat  flux  from  the  gas  phase. 
When  trying  to  use  the  relationships  (3.91)  and  (3.93)  we  face  with  the  need  for  assigning  the 
distribution  of  the  binder  area  between  the  oxidizer  particles  on  the  SP  surface.  In  the  petite 
ensemble  model  upon  the  calculation  of  the  heat  flux  from  the  "effective"  burning  particle  it  is 
accepted  that  the  binder  is  divided  into  equal  parts  between  all  (including  not  yet  burning)  par¬ 
ticles  at  the  surface. 


Here  the  authors  manifest  inconsistency:  when  formulating  the  polydisperse  version  of  the 
model  (see  Chapter  4)  they  proposed  the  nonuniform  distribution  of  the  binder  between  the 
original  particles  of  different  sizes.  It  would  be  natural  to  disseminate  this  non-uniformity,  to 


3—29 


the  distribution  of  the  binder  between  the  burning  particles,  which  have  different  sections  by 
the  plane  of  binder  even  with  the  same  initial  size  of  Do. 

The  discussed  deficiencies  in  theory,  connected  with  averaging  and  transience,  do  not  relate  to 
King's  model,  where  one  particle  is  examined  only,  but  averaging  is  conducted  according  to 
time.  It  is  the  only  model,  where  an  attempt  is  done  of  the  "direct"  account  of  transience.  Un¬ 
fortunately,  in  this  model  the  interaction  of  particle  with  its  neighbors  over  the  burning  surface 
of  SP  is  not  taken  into  consideration.  Without  such  interaction  it  is  impossible  in  any  able  way 
to  describe  the  bum  out  of  binder  before  and  after  the  burning  of  the  oxidizer  particle.  Interac¬ 
tion  “disappeared”  (adiabatic  planes  of  symmetry  were  introduced  to  bound  the  cell  with  the 
particle)  resulting  from  the  assumption  about  the  ordered  arrangement  of  the  particles  in  the 
SP.  Loss  of  the  randomness  in  the  model  became  the  cost  for  mathematical  simplicity,  essen¬ 
tial  for  physics  of  process  (see  about  the  role  of  randomness  [43]).  Specifically,  the  random¬ 
ness  ensures  at  any  moment  at  time  the  presence  on  the  SP  surface  of  the  set  of  the  hot  spots, 
heat  from  which  is  propagated  (for  example,  by  thermal  conductivity  through  the  condensed 
phase)  both  to  the  binder  and  to  the  yet  not  ignited  particles  of  the  oxidizer.  The  specimen  of 
SP  with  the  regular  arrangement  of  the  oxidizer  particles  has  anisotropic  properties  and  in 
some  directions  can  not  bum  at  all.  Namely  this  case  is  modeled  in  Ref.  [15]:  particles  of  AP 
form  the  cubic  lattice  in  the  SP,  the  specimen  is  ignited  on  the  plane  parallel  to  one  of  the 
symmetry  planes.  After  the  bum  out  of  the  first  layer  of  particles  it  remains  no  ore  focus  of 
heat  evolution  on  the  surface,  and  burning  must  be  interrupted.  Thus,  the  attempt  within  the 
framework  of  UTD-models  to  forego  natural  for  these  models  averaging  over  the  burning  sur¬ 
face  led  to  the  failure. 

Critical  discussion  of  the  surface  geometry  description  let  us  conduct  only  for  the  petite  en¬ 
semble  model,  for  which  geometry  considerations  are  developed  in  the  greatest  detail.  First  of 
all,  the  correctness  of  the  account  of  the  departing  AP  particles  causes  doubt.  Actually,  calcu¬ 
lation  of  carry-off  of  AP  in  the  model  with  clearly  assigned  by  geometry  surface  is  formally 
feasible. 

It  is  known,  however,  that  the  assumption  about  the  "quasi-planar”  surface  of  fuel  is  intro¬ 
duced  only  for  simplicity.  In  fact,  the  surface  of  binder  has  deviations  from  the  mean  level  of 
the  order  of  D0.  The  binder  in  the  zone  of  contact  with  AP  obtains  an  entirely  different  quan¬ 
tity  of  heat  than  on  the  middle  of  the  interlayer  between  two  grains.  This  unavoidably  causes 
the  bending  of  the  surface  of  fuel. 

Further,  under  the  assumption  about  "quasi-planarity"  an  account  of  carry-off  of  particles  is 
made  with  errors.  When  xmax  =  Dc,  it  is  incorrect  to  use  in  (3.84)  the  value  which  considers 
the  carry-off  of  AP  particles,  instead  of  £.  In  this  case,  with  the  carry-off  of  AP  particles  the 
surface  of  binder  in  the  model  remains  plane  without  additional  assumptions  about  the  behav¬ 
ior  of  melt.  In  this  case  the  expressions  are  valid  for  N  and  Asf  written  in  the  form  (3.83), 
(3.84).  To  illustrate  let  us  imagine  that  the  surface  of  fuel  moves  with  a  speed  of  Uf,  and  the  AP 
does  not  bum.  Therefore  entire  oxidizer  flies  away  from  the  burning  surface.  This  does  not 
prevent  us  from  deriving  formula  (3.84)  for  the  area  of  fuel,  belonging  to  one  AP  particle  (line 
of  reasoning  it  remains  previous).  It  is  a  different  fact  that  in  this  case  the  heat  balance  is 
changed,  since  the  temperature  of  the  adjacent  flame  is  lowered. 


3—30 


And  on  the  other  hand,  in  the  case  xcr  <  D0,  when  pits  appear  on  the  surface,  relation  (3.84)  be¬ 
comes  invalid,  which,  apparently,  remained  unnoticed.  When  on  the  surface  instead  of  some 
particles  depressions  appear,  it  is  impossible  after  that  to  use  expression  Sf/sp  =  1  -  C-  This  rela¬ 
tion  is  correct  only  for  the  section  of  initial  specimen  by  plane.  The  filling  of  pit  with  the  melt 
of  the  binder  nothing  varies:  in  this  case  there  is  lack  of  AP,  but  not  the  binder.  One  may  as¬ 
sume  that  the  pit  is  not  filled  with  melt  and  does  not  bum.  In  this  case  it  will  vanish  completely 
after  a  certain  time,  and  surface  will  become  a  plane,  see  Fig.  3.6.  Then  on  the  surface  it  is  ful¬ 
filled  Sp/Sf  =  1  -  where  Sf  stands  for  the  surface  of  the  gasified  binder.  But  for  calculating  the 
total  number  N  of  AP  particles  on  the  surface  an  expression  (3.81)  should  be  used  with  Xjgn  = 
0,  xmax  <  D0.  So  that  expression  Asf  in  (3.84)  acquires  multiplier  D0  /xmax. 

Let  us  note  that  in  Ref.  21  (see  also  Section  3.5.2)  the  "spherical"  geometry  of  the  AP  particles 
on  the  burning  surface  has  been  rejected,  referring  to  the  results  of  experimental  observations 
of  the  burning  surface. 


Fig.  3.6.  Possible  version  of  account  of  pits  on  the  burning  surface. 


Let  us  consider  used  in  the  UTD-models  the  concepts  about  burning  behavior  of  AP  in  com¬ 
bustion  of  SP.  Below,  in  Section  3.4.2,  it  will  be  shown  that  with  some  (completely  real)  pa¬ 
rameters  of  combustion  the  arrangement  of  the  flames,  assumed  as  the  basis  of  the  BDP 
model,  can  substantially  be  changed  because  of  the  ballasting  effect  of  the  binder  in  the  gas 
phase.  This  effect  is  not  considered  by  the  BDP  model. 

The  concept  about  the  burning  behavior  of  AP  developed  in  King's  in  model  causes  criticism. 
Examining  the  original  text  and  considering  the  value  Qap  =810  take  into  account  cal/g  pre¬ 
sented  in  the  table  of  constants,  one  may  come  to  the  conclusion  that  Ref.  [15]  does  not  take 
into  account  the  heat  release  in  the  condensed  phase  of  AP  as  monofuel.  Entire  heat  release 
under  the  burning  surface  of  composite  propellant  is  considered  occurring  due  to  the  reactions 
of  AP  with  binder,  according  to  [24].  It  follows  from  calculations  that  the  portion  of  the  pro¬ 
pellant,  which  is  decomposed  under  the  surface,  depends  on  the  burning  rate  and  comprises 
from  25  to  50%  (according  to  the  BDP  model  it  is  decomposed  under  the  surface  75%  of  AP). 
Sufficiently  convincing  arguments  in  favor  of  expression  1  -Qox  ~  const  =  0.7,  given  in  [20] 
for  pure  AP,  cannot  be  disproved  by  reference  only  to  the  fact  that  for  the  composite  propel¬ 
lants  the  BDP  model  poorly  corresponds  to  some  experiments.  As  for  the  relationship  (2.68) 
for  the  sub-surface  reactions,  considered  in  King's  model  between  the  AP  and  binder,  it  does 
not  include  a  dependence  on  the  AP  grain  size,  which  is  completely  unrealistic. 


3—31 


Thus,  time  tjgn  from  the  arrival  of  particle  to  the  surface  to  its  ignition  is  taken  as  equal  to  zero 
[15],  or  depending  on  pressure  [13,14],  or  from  pressure  and  size  of  particle  of  AP  [12].  Actu¬ 
ally,  the  ignition  time  must  depend  on  all  these  parameters,  as  well  as  on  the  nature  of  binder 
and  its  thermal  characteristics. 

3.4.  COARSE  OXIDIZER  CONDENSED  SYSTEMS 

3.4.1.  Effect  of  capability  of  oxidizer  for  self-sustaining  burning. 

Let  we  consider  as  coarse  the  oxidizer  grains  with  dimension  of  Dox  significantly  greater  of 
thickness  k/u  of  the  preheated  layer.  For  the  case  of  the  combustion  of  fine  oxidizer  grains 
there  are  sufficiently  in  detail  developed  models  (see  Sections  3.2  and  3.3).  As  far  as  the  SP 
with  coarse  oxidizer  grains  is  concerned,  the  situation  is  much  more  complex.  Beginning  from 
the  60's  theoretically  and  experimentally  it  was  developed  idea  about  the  determining  rate 
control  role  of  "tips"  -  foremost  sectors  of  the  combustion  front,  which  are  propagated  along 
the  contact  surface  of  fuel  and  oxidizer  [25,  1].  It  was  subsequently  explained  [26]  that  most 
widely  used  solid  oxidizer  (AP)  does  not  form  "tips"  in  the  conditions,  when  it  is  capable  of 
the  independent  burning.  It  was  reported  [26]  that  the  "tips"  were  discovered  in  the  case,  when 
the  catalyst  was  put  onto  the  contact  surface  of  AP  with  the  fuel. 

Experiments,  carried  out  by  Price  with  coworkers  [18],  are  most  informative.  The  laminated 
specimens  were  used,  which  consist  each  of  two  plates  of  pressed  AP  with  wedge-shaped  gap 
filled  with  fuel-binder.  As  the  binder  there  were  used:  polybutadiene  with  the  terminal  groups 
of  hydroxyl  (HTPB)  and  carboxyl  (CTPB),  copolymer  of  butadiene  with  acrylic  acid  (PBAA) 
or  with  acrylic  acid  and  acrylonitrile  (PBAN)  and  thiokol  (PSF).  Samples  were  combusted  in 
the  manometer  bomb  in  the  nitrogen  under  pressures  from  14  to  140  atm.

Extinction  of  the  burning  samples  was  made  by  fast  depressurization.  Samples  were  usually 
ignited  from  the  upper  end  (face  1  in  Fig.  3.7).  In  some  experiments  with  p<21  atm  the  speci¬ 
mens  were  ignited  from  the  front  (face  2  in  Fig.  3.7).  Pressure  in  this  case  did  not  decrease, 
and  extinction  occurred  due  to  the  heat  losses,  when  the  interlayer  of  fuel  on  the  surface  be¬ 
came  too  thin  for  maintaining  the  AP  combustion  (with  p<21  atm  pure  AP  is  not  capable  to  in¬ 
dependently  bum).  The  extinguished  surface  was  studied  under  an  electron  scanning  micro¬ 
scope.  The  methodology  described  makes  it  possible  to  investigate  burning  with  the  very  thin 
(up  to  10  |im)  interlayers  of  binder,  characteristic  of  typical  SP. 

The  profiles  of  the  extinguished  burning  surface  are  schematically  shown  in  Fig.  3.8  and  very 
similar  for  all  four  investigated  types  of  binder.  It  is  evident  that  at  all  pressures  and  sizes  of 


3—32 


the  interlayer  of  binder  the  AP  surface  in  the  immediate  proximity  of  the  binder  is  elevated 
that  indicates  that  the  rate  of  AP  bum  out  reduced  there.  At  a  high  pressure  (140  atm)  and  thick 
interlayers  of  the  binder  (more  than  70  pm)  on  the  specimens  with  binders  PBAN  and  PSF 
near  the  interface  with  the  binder  the  surface  AP  has  even  the  plane  sections.  Apparently,  they 
did  not  bum  before  the  moment  of  quenching.

Fig.  3.8.  Effect  of  pressure  and  thickness  of  binder  interlayer  on  profile 
of  the  burning  surface  [18].  Thickness  of  interlayer,  pm:  a)  150,  b)  70,  c)  30. 


In  the  specimens  with  thick  interlayers  the  binder  protrades  above  the  surface  of  the  AP  and 
even  (except  binder  PSF)  spreads  in  the  form  of  melt  over  it.  With  a  small  thickness  of 
interlayer  (30  pm)  and  at  all  pressures  the  surface  of  binder  is  also  fused,  but  it  is  located  be¬ 
low  the  level  of  AP  in  the  "groove".  The  walls  of  "groove"  are  parallel,  and  they  are  formed  by 
the  AP  without  traces  of  burning.  At  relatively  low  pressures  (p<  30  atm)  the  profile  of  surface 
for  all  sizes  of  interlayer  has  depressions,  in  which,  obviously,  there  was  the  maximum  speed 
of  burning.  Under  the  conditions,  when  AP  independently  does  not  bum  (p<2 1  atm),  on  the 
extinguished  surface  the  binder  is  located  on  the  bottom  of  the  heavy  cut  (having  nevertheless 
small  increase  in  the  middle),  while  with  the  thickness  of  the  binder  layer  <  20pm  there  is  no 
burning  generally.  It  was  also  noticed  that  the  strips  with  a  reduced  rate  of  the  AP  bum  out, 
situated  on  both  sides  from  the  binder  interlayer  under  all  conditions  for  experiment,  have  the 
smooth  surface,  which  differs  from  other  AP  surface.  There  was  no  such  strip  and,  respec¬ 
tively,  underspeeds  of  AP  burning  in  the  control  experiment,  where  instead  of  the  binder  mica 
was  inserted  into  the  specimen.  And  vice  versa,  analogous  strip  (on  the  AP  along  the  interface 
with  the  binder)  is  observed  on  the  photograph  [18]  of  the  extinguished  surface  of  SP,  which 
contained  AP  in  the  grain  form  and  binder  UTPB  and  burned  at  p=10  atm. 


Authors  of  [18]  stated  that  the  lowering  of  AP  burning  rate  in  the  vicinity  of  contact  with 
binder  can  not  be  explained  only  by  the  binder  spreading.  Actually,  in  thin  interlayers  binder 
was  in  "grooves”,  and  in  thick  interlayers  the  binder  PSF  did  not  spread,  which  is  evident  from

photographs.  As  a  possible  cause  for  suppressing  AP  burning  the  convection  cooling  is  pro¬ 
posed  of  its  surface  by  the  cold  products  of  the  pyrolysis  of  binder.  On  the  other  hand,  let  us 
note  that  besides  the  convection,  whose  role  is  reduced  when  examining  the  thinner  interlay¬ 
ers,  the  decelerating  effect  of  AP  burning  near  the  binder  one  may  explain  by  the  diffusion  di¬ 
lution  of  the  products  of  gasification  of  AP  by  the  products  of  the  binder  pyrolysis.  In  this  case 
the  location  of  point,  where  the  stoichiometric  ratio  of  the  mixture  is  reached  (and,  conse¬ 
quently,  the  maximum  of  burning  rate)  can  be  shifted  to  the  side  of  AP.  The  details  of  such 
combustion  behavior  are  given  below  (see  next  Section). 

Let  us  also  pay  attention  to  the  fact  [18]  (see  Fig.  3.8)  that  at  pressures  70  and  140  atm  there  is 
“pedestal”  on  the  AP  surface,  connected  with  deceleration  of  burning,  but  there  is  no  mini¬ 
mum,  connected  with  the  effect  of  primary  flame.  This  means  that  in  the  points  of  reaching  the 
stoichiometric  ratio  in  the  gaseous  mixture  the  burning  surface  obtains  less  heat  feedback  from 
the  gas  than  in  the  points  far  from  the  interlayer,  where  only  AP  bums.  Using  concepts  of  the 
BDP  model,  it  is  possible  to  claim  that  the  following  inequality  takes  place 

Qstoich  exp (-CoicH )  <  Gap  exp (rCp ).  P=70  atm>  (3-94) 

in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  "primary"  flame  is  hotter,  i.e.,  Qstoich>QAP-  Because  of  the  different 
flame  kinetics  the  values  C*stoch  and  ^*ap  differently  depend  on  pressure.  In  the  BDP  model  for 
the  composition  AP+PSF  the  orders  of  reaction  for  the  stoichiometric  mixture  ("primary 
flame")  and  the  inherent  AP  flame  are  assumed  to  be  1.5  and  1.8,  respectively.  Then,  accord¬ 
ing  to  (3.89)  the  right  side  of  (3.94)  more  strongly  depends  on  pressure,  and  with  lowering  in 
the  pressure  the  sign  of  inequality  in  (3.94)  will  be  changed.  And  indeed,  with  p=30  atm  we 
see  in  Fig.  3.8  the  profiles  with  minimum. 

Nevertheless,  it  should  be  noted  that  in  the  pressure  range  70-140  atm  the  results  of  experi¬ 
ments  described  above  do  not  entirely  correlate  with  the  widely  used  diagram  of  flames,  pro¬ 
posed  in  the  BDP  model.  For  better  understanding  of  the  combustion  mechanism  one  may 
consider  finding  of  Ref.  [23],  according  to  which  the  binder  surface  temperature  in  most  cases 
exceeds  the  AP  surface  temperature.  In  connection  with  this  the  existence  of  "grooves"  in  ex¬ 
periments  [18]  for  the  thin  interlayers  requires  explanation:  either  conclusions  [23]  are  incor¬ 
rect  or  grooves  were  formed  in  the  process  of  quenching.  However,  the  picture  of  surface  was 
identical  after  quenching  by  the  pressure  drop  and  spontaneous  extinction  with  p  =  const,  when 
depicted  in  Fig.  3.7  specimen  burned  from  face  2.  Therefore  it  is  impossible  to  explain  the 
formation  of  grooves  by  the  fact  that  with  the  pressure  drop  the  binder  was  thrown  out  by  the 
released  gas. 

One  additional  possibility  remains  unstudied.  Grooves  can  be  formed  provided  that  the  binder 
is  capable  of  the  relatively  slow  low-temperature  decomposition  during  a  certain  time  after 
disappearance  of  flame,  but  for  the  AP  there  is  no  such  capability.  If  in  this  way  a  layer  of 
binder  with  characteristic  size  of  the  thickness  of  the  preheated  layer  is  decomposed,  then 
groove  is  formed  in  the  case  when  the  thickness  of  interlayer  is  less  or  of  the  same  order  of 
magnitude  as  the  thickness  of  a  preheated  layer.  However,  for  the  thick  interlayers  the  projec¬ 
tions  has  to  be  preserved.  The  expressed  doubts  do  not  relate  to  the  correctness  of  treatment  of 
the  AP  surface  profile  in  Fig.  3.8:  since  the  walls  of  "grooves"  are  parallel,  the  AP  was  not  de¬ 
composed  there.  Even  if  it  was  decomposed  on  the  surface  within  the  time  of  quenching  at  the 
depth  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  a  preheated  layer  thickness,  this  would  not  change  the  gen- 


3—34 


eral  view  of  the  profiles  in  Fig.  3.8,  since  their  characteristic  dimensions,  for  example,  the 
distance  of  minimum  from  the  interface  between  AP  and  binder,  are  much  greater  than  the 
thickness  of  a  preheated  layer. 

3.4.2.  Correct  formulation  of  the  diffusion  flame  problem  (Burke  -  Schumann  solution). 

The  known  solution  of  Burke-  Schumann  [27,28]  for  the  form  of  the  gas  burner  diffusion 
flame  was  used  for  description  of  SP  combustion  in  the  BDP  model  [13]  and  other  models  cre¬ 
ated  on  its  basis  (see  survey  [19]  and  [29]). 


Fig.  3.9.  Diagram  of  the  gas  burner. 

In  [27,28],  the  form  of  laminar  diffusion  flame  has  been  analytically  found  for  the  burner,  into 
which  the  gaseous  oxidizer  and  fuel  enter  via  coaxial  tubes  (Fig.  3.9).  The  version  of  the  "flat 
flame"  burner  was  also  examined.  According  to  Fig.3.9  the  flame  begins  at  the  edge  of  the 
wall  of  the  core  tube  and  is  finished  on  the  axis  of  flow  or  on  the  wall  of  external  tube.  This 
depends  on  which  reagent  from  those  coming  through  the  internal  or  through  the  external  tube, 
is  in  the  deficiency.  Solution  is  obtained  for  the  extended  (“long")  flames,  with  parameter 
\|/=pD/mb«l.  Here  p,  D  and  m  -  density,  diffusion  coefficient,  and  mass  flow  of  gases,  re¬ 
spectively;  b  -  radius  of  external  tube.  With  \|/«1  it  is  possible  to  neglect  without  large  error 
the  "cross  heterogeneity”  of  value  m  and  the  non-uniform  character  of  flow,  caused  by  the  heat 
evolution  in  flame  and  non-uniformity  of  mass  supply  in  the  pipes.  Flame  form  and  length, 
computed  according  to  the  solution  of  Burke-Schumann,  are  close  to  experimentally  measured 
on  the  gas  burners. 

The  problem  formulation  [27]  has  been  used  in  BDP  model  [13]  for  modeling  the  SP  combus¬ 
tion.  The  element  of  the  plane  burning  surface  in  the  form  of  a  circle  r  <  a  of  oxidizer  and  sur¬ 
rounding  interlayer  a<r<b  of  fuel  was  examined.  In  this  case  it  was  necessary  to  generalize 
solution  to  the  characteristic  for  SP  the  case  of  "short"  flames,  \|/  >  L  However,  in  [13]  and  in 
all  subsequent  works  it  was  not  taken  into  consideration  that  with  assumption  \|/  =  1  the 
boundary  condition  on  plane  z=0  (on  the  SP  surface),  used  in  Ref.  [27],  is  not  correct.  Due  to 
this  the  form  of  flame  can  be  radically  changed,  which  is  shown  below. 


3—35 


Let  us  assume  that  the  mass  burning  rate  over  entire  SP  surface  is  identical  and  equal  to  m. 
The  mass  flow  rate  in  the  gas  also  is  everywhere  identical,  equal  to  m  of  and  is  directed  along 
axis  z  from  the  surface.  The  relative  concentrations  equal  to  oq  for  oxidizer  and  CC2  for  fuel. 
The  mass  transfer  proceeds  according  to  the  Fick  law  with  the  coefficient  of  diffusion  D.  It  is 
assumed  that  everywhere  pD  =  idem.  The  gas-impermeable  baffle  is  installed  at  x  =  ±  b.  This 
phenomenon  is  mathematically  described  as  follows: 

mda,  /dz  =  pDV2a,  -  w, ,

Depending  on  the  form  of  the  Laplace  operator  V2,  the  problem  (3.95)  can  describe  the  plane 
or  axisynmetric  case.  It  is  assumed  that  oxidizer  Ai  and  fuel  A2  react  according  to  the  reaction 
scheme: 

v,A  +  v2A,  ->v3A3 

Obviously,  the  reaction  rates  wi,  W2  are  connected  with  the  relationship 

Wi  /(v1p1)=w2/(v2p2) 

Here  pi,  jn2  -  molar  masses.  Expressions  for  the  reaction  rates  can  be  excluded  from  the  ex¬ 
amination,  if  instead  of  ai  and  a2  we  will  seek  their  combination  P=ai-va2  where  v' 
'=(V2M-2)/(v  1P1)  is  the  stoichiometric  mass  ratio  (f/ox)  for  the  examined  composition  oxidizer- 
fuel.  In  terms  of  P  the  problem  takes  the  form

To  simulate  the  conditions  of  the  described  above  experiment  [18]  with  a  thin  layer  of  fuel 
(with  thickness  2h)  between  thick  layers  of  oxidizer  one  should  assume  b  — >  °°  and  take  in

By  comparing  expression  (3.97)  with  solutions  [27, 28]  in  the  form 

p  =  (l  +  v)c2  - v  +  2c(l  +  v^Akkk)  exp(-r)\|/(pf ) 

we  recognize  that  in  latter  instead  of  complex  (3.100) 

f(y,T\,k)=  2/^l  +  (2(p^tf  +  lj  exp  -^[V1  +  (2m)2

Of  course,  this  result  was  obtained  in  [27,28]  not  by  simplification  of  expression  (3.97),  but  by 
solving  the  problem  simplified  in  comparison  with  (3.96).  In  particular,  the  index  in  exponen¬ 
tial  term  was  changed  as  a  result  of  neglecting  by  the  term  32f)/3z2  in  the  equation  of  diffusion 
(3.96).  However,  the  multiplier  before  the  exponential  term  in  (3.100)  was  degenerated  into 
unity  due  to  neglecting  in  boundary  condition  (3.96)  by  diffusion  flux  -\|/3p/3(z/ft).  It  means 
the  following  for  was  used

Comparing  now  with  (3.97)  the  solution  [13]  generalized  for  the  "short"  flames  (exhibited  in 
the  expanded  form  in  [19]),  one  may  recognize  that  the  exponential  terms  turn  out  to  be  equal, 
since  in  the  equation  of  diffusion  the  term  32p/9z2  is  taken  into  consideration.  The  multiplier 
before  the  exponential  term  in  expression  (3.100),  in  Ref.  [19]  as  well  as  in  [27,28],  is  degen¬ 
erated  into  unity  that  indicates  the  utilization  of  simplified  boundary  condition  of  (3.101)  type. 


Let  us  show  how  this  solution  was  used  in  the  models  of  BDP  type.  From  the  definition  of  P  it 
follows  that  with  P  =  0  the  stoichiometric  ratio  of  components  is  achieved.  In  particular,  if 
there  is  a  diffusion  flame,  its  front  must  be  localized  on  the  surface  P  =  0.  In  the  front  of  diffu¬ 
sion  flame  we  have  cq  =  0C2  =  0,  and  the  ratio  of  components  takes  all  values,  including  stoi¬ 
chiometric.  In  order  to  find  the  height  of  the  flame,  for  example,  when  it  is  closed  above  the 
particle  of  oxidizer,  one  should  assume  P=0,  £=0  and  express  the  height  x*=z=br|  from  ex¬ 
pression  (3.97).  Considering  only  the  first  term  in  (3.97),  authors  [13]  expressed  r|  in  the  form: 

x*  =  z  =  26w/^a/1  +  (7-64v)2  -l),  (3-102) 

where  y  -  logarithmic  (supposedly  weakly  changing)  function  of  v,  c,  \y.  Then  with  \|/>1  it  is 
possible  to  set  x*=2b=2a=Dc.  In  Ref.  [14],  the  value  of  x*  was  determined  numerically  taking 
into  account  few  terms  of  series,  in  Ref.  [21]  there  were  considered  50  and  more  terms.  By 
numerical  calculation  and  by  selection  of  the  constants  the  expressions  were  obtained  [21]  for 
the  "diffusion"  height  of  flame  above  the  oxidizer  (if  f/ox  <  (f/ox)st0ich): 

**  =  2.02b(f  /  o)°s^h  (/  /  ox)1604  (3.103) 

and  above  the  binder  (if  f/ox  <  f/oxst0ich) 

je*  -1.17 b(f/ox)^(f/oxfm  (3.104) 

Here  b  -  external  radius  of  two-  layer  oxidizer-fuel  gas  jet;  for  SP,  as  a  rule,  2b  »  Dc. 

In  King’s  model  [15]  attempt  was  made  of  recomputation  of  stream  dimension  b  and  ratio  b/a 
taking  into  account  the  fact  that  mass  burning  rates  of  oxidizer  and  can  he  different,  but  linear 
gas  velocities  approach  to  leveling  due  to  friction.  It  was  assumed  that  the  velocities  leveling 
occurs  on  the  distance  which  is  considerably  smaller  than  the  height  of  diffusion  flame.  As  it 
was  noted  in  [19],  this  assumption  is  insufficiently  substantiated.  Indeed,  the  velocities  and 
concentrations  leveling  occurs  by  the  same  mechanism  and  approximately  for  at  one  time. 

Let  us  examine  now,  which  consequences  for  the  combustion  models  give  neglecting  by  the 
diffusion  term  in  the  boundary  conditions  of  problem  (3.95)  that  is  permissible  only  with  \|/  = 
pD/mb  «  1.  According  to  boundary  condition  (3.101),  the  surface  P  =  0  originates  in  the 
place  of  the  contact  of  the  solid  oxidizer  and  fuel  on  the  SP  surface.  Here  P(x,  0)  has  a  discon¬ 
tinuity  with  sign  change,  i.e.,  it  may  have  any  magnitude  in  the  range  from  -v  to  1,  including  0. 

However,  the  accurate  boundary  condition  of  the  problem  (3.96)  at  z  =  0,  x  =  a  contains  dis¬ 
continuity  only  of  the  gradient  of  P  value.  The  value  of  P  itself  is  continuous  and  it  is  not  nec¬ 
essarily  equal  to  zero.  Surface  P  =  0  originates  not  in  the  place  of  the  contact  of  the  solid  oxi¬ 
dizer  and  fuel.  This  displacement  becomes  greater  with  increase  of  (1-v)  and  \|/.  Moreover,  un- 


3—38 


der  some  conditions  the  surface  P=0  and  the  diffusion  flame  can  not  be  realized  at  all.  Using 
expression  (3.97)  one  may  find  condition,  with  which  this  surface  is  subtended  into  single 
point  due  to  the  excess  of  fuel.  Let  we  substitute  £=0,  T]=0,  (3=0  in  (3.97):

This  equation  is  equivalent  to  the  condition  of  transformation  into  single  point  of  a  “stoichi¬ 
ometric”  flame  surface  above  single  oxidizer  crystal  situated  at  the  plane  surface  of  fuel  gas¬ 
ified  with  mass  flow  rate  m  (the  same  as  for  oxidizer).  The  above  equation  follows  from  the 
equation  in  generalized  form  (3.99a)  at  values  r=r|=p=0. 

In  the  models  [13,14,16]  the  effect  of  no-existence  of  diffusion  flames  was  not  taken  into  con¬ 
sideration.  However,  these  models  managed  to  describe  a  transition  to  kinetic  combustion  re¬ 
gime  (premixed  flame)  with  a— >0.  This  was  done  using  some  artificial  approach,  namely,  by 
representing  the  heat  feedback  from  the  primary  flame  to  the  surface  of  sample  S  in  the  form: 

q  =  m  S  Pf  Qpf  exp(-XpF  ),  Qpf  =  c(Tf  —  To)  +  a  Ql  +  (1  -  00  Qf,

(3.106) 


Xpf  =  Xrpf  +  0.6a 

Here  (3f  -  fraction  of  oxidizer  consumed  in  the  primary  flame  of  decomposition  products  of 
oxidizer  and  fuel;  Ql  and  Qf  -  heat  of  gasification  for  oxidizer  and  fuel,  respectively;  0.6a  - 
“diffusion”  height,  X*RPF  -  “kinetic”  height  that  depends  for  given  components  only  on  TF  and 
P;  TF  -  maximal  temperature  in  the  final  flame  calculated  by  thermal-equilibrium  program. 


With  2a—>0  and  (3f— >1,  relationships  (3.106)  give  correct  estimation  for  heat  feedback  to  the 
burning  surface  from  premixed  flame  with  narrow  zone  of  heat  release.  However,  with  2a>0 
and  pF  <0  these  formulae  do  not  describe  the  heat  feedback  from  diffusion  “primary”  flame 
whose  temperature  corresponds  to  stoichiometric  ratio  of  the  components  and  does  not  depend 
on  a.  Namely  such  value  of  TF  was  postulated  in  Ref.  [21].  But  when  taking  TFj  corresponding 
to  stoichiometric  flame  value,  the  relationships  (3.106)  loose  the  possibility  to  describe  “ki¬ 
netic”  combustion  regime  for  premixed  gas  at  2a  — >  0.  These  difficulties  can  be  overcome  in  a 
formal  way  if  one  takes  Tf  changing  from  “kinetic”  to  “diffusion”  value  upon  changing  the 

value  of  (0.6a/ X^pF)  from  0  to  °o.  More  justified  approach  has  to  take  into  consideration  si¬ 
multaneous  existence  of  the  “cap”  of  diffusion  flame  above  the  top  of  oxidizer  grain  of  finite 
size  and  some  cooler  flame  of  premixed  gas  above  the  rest  of  the  oxidizer  surface  and  binder. 


Let  us  evaluate  a  possibility  of  disappearing  the  diffusion  flame  above  the  oxidizer  particles 
(Fig.  3.10)  in  typical  combustion  conditions.  According  to  Ref.  [13],  pD  =  1.6  10'4  (g/cm  s); 
(T/T0)3/2;  To=300K;  T  *  2545K;  and  pD  »  0.8. 10‘3  g/(cm  s).  Let  also  m  «  0.5  g/(cm2  s),  2a  *  20 
pm,  where  value  2a  approximately  corresponds  to  the  size  of  the  oxidizer  particle.  Then 
i|/~1.4,  and  pD/(pD+2a  m)=xF/(T/+2)  =  0.41.  According  to  graphs  in  Fig.  3.10  the  diffusion 
flame  will  not  exist  at  a^O.6,  and  such  values  of  Ost  are  reasonable  for  real  SPs,  which  have 
typically  ast  =  0.82-0.88.  Actually,  the  diffusion  flame  disappears  already  with  smaller  Ost. 


Similar  effect  of  diminishing  the  area  of  “stoichiometric”  surface  can  be  examined  for  the  case 
of  combustion  of  laminated  (“sandwich”-type)  samples  -  thin  layer  of  binder  between  thick 
layer  of  pressed  AP.  It  follows  from  (3.99)  at  r|=p=0  that  the  distance  X  from  the  middle  point 
of  the  binder  lamina  to  the  place  of  reaching  stoichiometric  ratio  in  gas  above  the  sample  sur¬ 
face  meets  the  relationship

Function  F  has  a  maximum  Fm  at  t=tm  with  equality  t3  /(1-t2)  =  z  being  held.  The  function

Fig.  3.11.  Dependence  of  <p  versus  z. 

The  plot  of  (p(z)  is  presented  in  Fig.  3.11.  Let  us  estimate  at  which  conditions  the  stoichi¬ 
ometric  ratio  in  the  gas  phase  is  reached  exactly  on  the  line  X  =  L  corresponding  to  the  inter¬ 
face  between  binder  and  oxidizer.  Assuming  in  (3.107)  X  =  Y  ,  we  may  take  typical  value  of 
0Cst  equaled  0.875.  Then  relationship  (3.107)  gets  the  form  <p( z)  =  <p(2Y  )~ 0.25 .  According  to 
Fig.3.11  it  follows  that  z  =  2?  =  0.05.  Finally,  assuming  pD  =  O.OOlg  / cm  •  s  and 
m~0.5gl  cm2 -s  one  obtains  2L ~ 5 -10~5 cm  =  0.5jum.  Since  that  in  experiments  [18]  the 
binder  layer  width  2L  was  no  less  than  10  pm,  one  may  conclude  that  in  most  practically 
meaning  cases  the  experiments  with  laminated  samples  combustion  lead  to  the  following  ex¬ 
pressions,  which  mean  that  stoichiometric  ratio  is  reached  above  the  oxidizer  surface: 

X  >Y;  X  >  L . 

Looking  on  the  plot  in  Fig.3.11  one  may  conclude  that  it  is  convenient  to  solve  the  relationship 
(3.107)  by  iteration  method  assuming  for  the  beginning  X0  — >  °° : 

cp(X/+1  -Y  )  =  (p(Xt -Y  )-2(l  -  ast)  (3.109) 

The  first  approximation  takes  the  form: 

X  =  L  +  (pD/m)  const  (3.110) 

Here  constant  value  depends  on  and  does  not  depend  on  L.  Thus,  expression  (3.110)  does 
not  give  dependence  of  (X-L)  on  L  that  correlates  well  with  experimental  findings.  In  experi- 


3 — 41 


ments  [18]  with  sufficiently  wide  variation  of  size  2L  of  the  binder  layer  the  maximal  burning 
rate  of  oxidizer  was  reached  approximately  at  the  same  distance  from  the  binder-oxidizer  inter¬ 
face.  Adjusting  to  the  interface  the  oxidizer  surface  burned  with  lowered  rate  and  had 
“smooth”  shape.  Explanation  [18]  of  the  low  burning  rate  due  to  influence  of  the  convective 
cooling  the  oxidizer  surface  by  combustible  gases  does  not  take  into  consideration  the  role  of 
diffusion  thermal  processes  in  the  gas  phase.  According  to  discussed  here  approach  the  low¬ 
ering  of  the  burning  rate  close  to  the  binder-oxidizer  interface  can  be  caused  by  significant  di¬ 
lution  of  oxidizer  decomposition  gases  with  the  fuel  decomposition  products. 

The  fact  is  that  on  the  surface  (3=0  the  concentration  of  components  is  in  stoichiometric  ratio 
and  concentrations  not  necessarily  equal  to  zero.  They  turn  into  zero  (which  is  characteristic 
for  the  diffusion  flame)  on  this  surface  only  at  a  certain  "kinetic"  distance  from  SP.  Therefore, 
with  a  decrease  in  the  area  of  the  surface  (1=0  its  “diffusion"  part  will  vanish  before  than  entire 
surface  (3=0  vanishes,  see  Fig.  3.12. 


Fig.  3.12.  The  flame  form  with  taking  into  account  the  diffusion  in  boundary  condition. 

Let  us  consider  further  some  results  of  solution  of  the  problem  of  Burke-Schumann.  If  in  the 
described  experiment  on  the  combustion  of  laminated  specimens  with  thin  interlayers  of 
binder  [18]  a  deceleration  of  AP  burning  is  actually  caused  not  by  spreading  of  binder  melt, 
but  by  the  excess  of  the  products  of  its  pyrolysis  in  the  gas  phase,  then  minimum  on  the  sur¬ 
face  profile  of  AP  must  correspond  to  the  stoichiometric  ratio  of  components  in  the  gas  flame 
above  this  place.  In  this  case  the  characteristic  value  of  pressure  p=pi,  with  which  the  mini¬ 
mum  on  the  AP  profile  vanishes  with  increase  of  p,  contains  information  useful  for  determin¬ 
ing  constants  entering  in  the  combustion  model.  Thus,  by  analogy  with  (3.94)  one  obtains 

Qstoich  exp(-  Coich  )  =  QaP  exp(~ Fap\  P  =  Pi  (3- 1 1 !) 

Here  £*=cmx*/X,  for  calculating  x*  the  ratios  of  type  (3.37)  and  (3.38)  are  used.  Expression 
(3.111)  is  useful  for  selection  of  the  constants.  In  addition,  a  certain  information  about  the  dif¬ 
fusion  coefficient  can  be  extracted  also  from  the  value  of  the  coordinate  of  minimum  on  the 
profile  of  quenched  AP. 

As  far  as  solution  of  Burke-Schumann  discussed  above  is  concerned,  despite  its  oversimplifi¬ 
cations  there  is  deserving  confidence  conclusion  about  disappearance  with  sufficiently  high 
values  of  parameters  \|f  and  d>  of  the  surface  (3=0,  where  the  stoichiometric  ratio  of  compo¬ 
nents  is  achieved.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  the  form  of  boundary  condition  on  the  surface 
of  SP  and  may  not  be  changed  if  under  the  same  condition  we  take  into  account  the  "hydrody- 


3 — 42 


namic"  heterogeneity  of  problem,  caused  by  heat  evolution  in  the  flame  and  variability  along 
the  surface  of  SP  of  the  mass  flow  rate  of  gas  formation.

3.5.1.  Effect  of  non-uniform  surface  temperature. 

Oxidizer  and  binder  can  have  considerably  distinguished  temperatures  of  surface  as  it  was  es¬ 
tablished  experimentally,  for  example,  in  Ref.  [23].  In  that  work  the  pyrolysis  of  seven  types 
of  the  binder  upon  radiative  heating  was  performed,  with  values  of  the  surface  temperature  and 
the  rate  of  ablation  being  measured,  and  movie  film  being  conducted.  Experimental  data  [23] 
are  presented  in  Table  3.2.  Filming  showed  that  with  typical  for  the  combustion  of  SP  heat 
fluxes  the  binder  on  the  surface  is  in  a  liquid  state  and  contains  the  coke  formations,  whose 
number  increases  with  pressure,  and  also  in  the  presence  of  AP.  Referring  to  the  low  values  of 
value  E  in  the  pyrolysis  law  m=Aexp(-E/RTs)  (see  Table  3.2),  the  authors  [23]  draw  the  con¬ 
clusion  that  the  boiling  or  degradation  of  polymers  thru  the  weak  bonds  takes  place. 

In  Section  3.3.5  we  discussed  "improved  model"  [16]  that  considers  difference  in  temperatures 
of  oxidizer  Ts  and  binder  Tf  on  the  burning  surface.  The  contradictory  character  was  noted  of 
the  utilization  of  balances  of  heat  for  these  components  (by  averaging  heat  feedback  to  the  sur¬ 
face  of  SP,  as  this  was  done  in  models  of  the  BDP  type)  without  taking  into  account  the  heat 
exchange  between  them  in  the  condensed  phase.  This  contradiction  can  only  be  avoided  in  the 
more  detailed  examination  of  the  processes  on  the  surface  of  SP.  If  it  is  possible  to  neglect 
spreading  of  the  liquid  binder  over  the  SP  surface,  then  the  problem  is  reduced  to  taking  into 
consideration  of  the  non-uniformities  (roughness)  surface  of  SP.  Note  that  the  roughness  of  the 
burning  surface  was  not  considered  in  Ref.  [16]  because  earlier  it  was  stated  [23]  that  this  ef¬ 
fect  may  only  slightly  change  the  calculated  burning  rate.  However,  “two-temperature  models” 
[30,  31]  (see  also  Ref.  [1])  took  into  account  the  roughness  of  the  burning  surface.

Note.  A  -  mass  flow  rate  of  pyrolysis,  E  -  energy  of  activation,  Q  -  heat  of  decomposition;  M  - 
molar  mass  of  the  products  of  pyrolysis;  (ox/f)stoich  is  calculated  by  taking  AP  as  an  oxidizer; 
Tp  is  the  flame  temperature  calculated  for  SP  with  the  ratio  AP /Binder  equal  to  70/30. 

It  is  believed  that  the  SP  combustion  behavior  may  substantially  depend  on  how  decomposi¬ 
tion  products  of  AP  under  a  layer  of  the  binder  are  released:  whether  the  blisters  or  channels 
are  formed  or  simply  the  section  of  binder,  located  directly  above  the  ignited  crystal  of  AP,  is 
ejected  into  the  gas  phase.  According  to  Ref.  [32],  namely  the  latter  case  was  observed  by  the 
authors  of  works  [33]  and  [34]:  in  combustion  of  SP  based  on  the  polybutadiene  binder  and 
nitramines  (the  latter  have  Ts  much  lower  than  that  for  AP)  the  binder  was  shouted  in  the  gas 
phase  in  the  form  of  ribbons. 

One  may  also  analyze  an  opposite  case  (SP  based  on  volatile  binder),  when  the  temperature  on 
the  surface  of  binder  is  lower  than  that  of  oxidizer,  i.e.  TSf  <  Ts.  In  this  case  a  UTD-model  must 
consider  the  escape  of  the  oxidizer  particles  into  the  gas  phase. 

Sizes  of  ejected  crystals  of  AP  can  be  estimated.  We  will  consider  that  grains  of  AP  are  pep¬ 
tized  from  the  burning  surface  of  SP  as  a  result  of  the  loss  of  contact  with  the  bonding  agent 
due  to  the  gasification  of  binder  under  the  crystal.  For  sufficiently  large  AP  particles  it  is  pos¬ 
sible  to  disregard  the  curvature  of  their  surface  and  to  consider  plane  isothermal  surfaces  in  the 
burning  crystal.  Then  it  can  be  to  shown  that  at  the  moment  of  reaching  the  temperature  of  the 
binder  gasification  TSf  by  the  rear  boundary  of  the  grain,  the  remaining  thickness  of  crystal  h  in 
the  direction  of  burning  is  equal  to 

A-(*7ii)lnKr,  -2-„)/(7y  -rj  (3.112) 

Here  k,  u  and  Ts  -thermal  diffusivity,  linear  burning  rate  and  the  temperature  of  the  burning 
surface  of  AP  crystal.  When  deriving  (3.112)  there  was  not  taken  into  consideration  thermal 
conductivity  variation  upon  crossing  interface  AP  -  binder.  Partly  this  is  compensated  by  the 
fact  that  for  the  burning  AP  the  temperature  profile  is  considerably  more  stretched  [41],  than 
computed  according  to  Michelson's  equation,  used  in  deriving  (3.112). 

Diameter  of  sphere,  equivalent  by  volume  to  ejected  spherical  segment,  equals  D=(6w/7t)1/3, 
where  w  =(7th2/3)[(3/2)Do-h]  -  volume  of  segment.  Do  -  initial  size  of  AP  crystal. 

Finally,  for  the  diameter  of  the  ejected  particle  we  obtain 

r>„ 

where  h  is  calculated  by  (3.112)  with  known  values  u,  Ts,  Tsf. 

For  functional  test  of  the  model  presented  we  carried  out  experiments  on  recording  via  micro¬ 
cinematography  of  the  particle  sizes  of  AP,  which  are  ejected  from  the  burning  surface  of 
model  SP  specimens.  As  the  binder  the  polymer  with  known  relation  Tsf  =  consti  ln(const2/  p) 
was  used.  Samples  were  prepared  with  monodisperse  powders  of  AP,  which  had  a  mean 


3—44 


counting  particle  size  from  200  to  750  pm.  Combustion  experiments  were  conducted  at  pres¬ 
sures  1  and  33  atm. 

Temperature  of  AP  surface  was  calculated  by  formula  [42] 

,K\  [u]  =  cm/s. 

It  was  used  in  calculations  of  Ts  that  u  is  equal  to  the  linear  burning  rate  ui  of  the  SP  speci¬ 
mens.  The  experimental  dependence  ui(p)  was  used.  The  disagreement  of  experimental  and 
calculated  values  of  Da  in  all  cases  did  not  exceed  30%. 

3.5.2.”Relay  race”  type  models. 

If  there  are  evidences  for  considering  the  burning  rate  of  oxidizer  the  known  value  (for  exam¬ 
ple,  sufficiently  coarse  grains  of  AP  or  nitramines  may  bum  as  monopropellant)  or  very  large 
in  comparison  with  the  burning  rate  of  binder,  then  for  calculating  the  burning  rate  of  SP  it  is 
convenient  to  use  averaging  over  time.  Returning  to  the  "photographic"  concept,  we  may  say 
that  the  averaging  parameters  over  the  surface  of  SP,  characteristic  of  the  UTD-models,  can  be 
identified  with  the  utilization  of  an  instantaneous  photograph  of  the  surface  (King’s  approach  - 
with  the  movie  about  behavior  of  a  single  particle)  whereas  averaging  over  time  -  with  suffi¬ 
ciently  prolonged  filming  of  region  on  the  burning  surface  of  SP  with  size  of  the  order  of  D0. 

Beckstead  in  Ref.  [35]  calls  this  approach  by  term  "successive"  when  particles  of  oxidizer  fall 
in  the  field  of  view  of  researcher  one  after  another,  in  contrast  to  the  "parallel",  i.e.,  simultane¬ 
ous  their  examination  when  averaging  over  the  surface.  In  the  following  discussion  we  will 
call  models  with  the  averaging  over  time  “the  relay  race”  models. 

Apparently,  Bakhman  and  Belyayev  [1]  were  the  first  who  applied  this  approach.  They  deter¬ 
mined  mean  linear  burning  rate  as  the  ratio  of  a  certain  characteristic  distance,  taken  along  the 
normal  to  the  mean  burning  surface,  to  the  time  of  passing  that  distance  by  the  burning  sur¬ 
face.  The  diameter  D0  of  the  oxidizer  grain  together  with  the  thickness  df  of  relating  to  this 
grain  layer  of  binder  was  selected  in  Ref.  [1]  as  such  distance.  If  the  mean  burning  rates  of 
oxidizer  and  binder  are  equal  to  u0  and  Uf,  respectively,  then  the  average  rate  of  SP  combustion 
can  be  calculated  by  formula

i.e.,  the  rate  of  SP  combustion  is  controlled  by  the  slow  burnout  of  binder.  In  Ref.  [1],  the  op¬

The  relation  (3.115)  shows,  in  which  case  an  assumption  u  =  uox,  accepted  in  the  models  of  the 
BDP  type,  is  justified. 

“Relay  race”  approach  for  SP  based  on  AP  and  active,  i.e.  capable  of  independent  burning, 
binder  was  also  used  by  Kubota  and  Masamoto  [36],  who  proposed  analogous  (3.113)  rela¬ 
tionship 


l/u  =  {C'/uAP)+{l-CVuf  (3-116) 

Here  -  the  volume  fraction  of  SP,  which  bums  with  the  rate  uap-  It  is  assumed  that  not  only 
AP  bums  with  this  rate,  but  also  part  of  the  binder,  namely,  the  layer  with  a  thickness  of  r\ 
around  each  crystal  of  AP.  The  dependence  of  thickness  of  the  layer  on  size  D0  of  particle  AP 
is  not  considered. 

If  £  -  volume  fraction  of  AP  and  n  -  number  of  AP  particles  per  unit  of  volume  of  SP,  then  for 
it  is  implemented 

C  =  (n  / 6 ){D0  +  2r\)3 n  =  (n mD3  / 6)(l  +  2r\  /  D0 )3  =  C(l  +  2v\  /  D0 )3  (3. 1 17) 

For  calculation  of  uap  the  empirical  dependence  is  used 

uAP  =  O.38p045  /D0015  (3.118) 

Here  we  have:  [u]  =  cm/s,  [p]=atm,  [D0]=  pm.  Burning  rate  of  combustion  of  the  remaining 
part  of  the  binder,  excluding  layers  surrounding  the  particles  of  AP,  is  defined  as  for  the 
monopropellant  (see  Section  3.2.1). 


Fig.  3.13.  To  the  method  of  averaging  for  the  “relay  race”  model. 

An  attempt  to  take  into  account  in  more  detail  an  interaction  of  components  within  the  frame¬ 
work  of  the  relay  race  model  was  undertaken  in  Refs.  [21,35].  As  in  the  model  of  Bakhman 
and  Belyayev  [1],  the  combustion  is  examined  in  direction  of  normal  to  the  mean  burning  sur¬ 
face  in  successive  intervals  of  time  for  different  sections  of  oxidizer  and  binder,  situated  along 
the  normal  (see  Fig.  3.13).  It  is  assumed  that  in  the  real  case  the  burning  is  propagated  along 
the  way,  which  is  only  slightly  deflected  from  this  normal.  The  time  averaged  burning  rate  of 
sufficiently  long,  in  comparison  with  the  size  of  particles  D0,  specimen  length  is  calculated 
by: 


3 — 46 


(3.119) 


_  x  _  _ x _ 

M_7_  iv[7;s„  +(d/m0)+(//«/  +(i-/)/m})j] 

Here  N  -  number  of  the  crossed  AP  particles  by  the  normal;  D  -  average  size  of  this  intersec¬ 
tion;  d  -  average  size  of  intersection  of  normal  with  the  binder  section;  tign  -  time  of  the  particle 
ignition;  u0  -  rate  of  its  burning;  f  -  fraction  of  the  binder,  which  bums  in  the  "primary  flame" 
with  the  oxidizer;  Uf  -  rate  of  its  bum  out;  u*f  -  rate  of  the  pyrolysis  of  the  remaining  binder. 

Since  with  random  distribution  of  particles  in  the  volume  of  SP  the  components  along  straight 
line  are  presented  in  the  same  ratio  as  in  the  bulk  of  SP,  one  has: 

DN/x  =  £,  Nd/x  =  l-C,  (3-120) 

where  C,  -  volume  fraction  of  oxidizer.  Now  (3.119)  takes  the  form 

l/U=Iw(f/D)+(f/«0)  +  (l-f)(//U/+(l-/)/B;)  (3.121) 

For  entering  in  (3.121)  average  size  D  of  intersection  of  the  particle  with  normal  the  authors  of 
[35]  accept  D  =  £>0-\/2/3  ,  referring  to  Hermance  [12].  For  the  ignition  time  calculation  of  AP 
particle  the  relationship  is  used 


V  =  4.32-^ Z>;7  /»„  (3.122) 

cm 

This  expression  was  obtained  via  treating  experiments  [37]  for  AP,  but  it  was  also  applied  in 
[35, 21]  for  octogen.  Here 


c  =  (e,  -T„)/(Tr„-T0)  (3.123) 


where  Es  -  energy  of  activation  of  the  surface  reaction;  Tmeit  -  melting  point  of  oxidizer;  Eref, 
Tref  -  constants.  For  the  rate  of  pyrolysis  u*f  of  the  part  of  binder  outside  of  the  "primary 
flame"  an  expression  is  proposed  with  the  reference  to  the  work  of  Strahle  [38] 

u*f  ~  uexp(-ufd /2k)  (3.124) 

where  k  -  thermal  diffusivity  of  the  condensed  phase.  For  entering  into  (3.121)  rates  u0  and  Uf 
the  separate  balances  of  heat  are  written  as  in  the  two-temperature  "improved  model”  [16]. 
Burning  rate  of  oxidizer  is  determined  from  the  relation  of  the  type  of  pyrolysis  law  and  equa¬ 
tion  of  the  balance  of  heat,  written  only  for  oxidizer.  This  equation  takes  the  form: 

c{Ts  -T0)  =  -Ql  +  Pp PF  (l  +  (/  / ox)stoich  )Qpf  exp(-  %PF  )+(L-0f  )Qox  exp(-  %ox )  (3.125) 


3 — 47 


Here  Ts  -  temperature  of  the  burning  surface  of  oxidizer;  Ql  -  thermal  effect  of  gasification. 
The  second  term  in  the  right  hand  side  describes  the  heat  feedback  from  the  "primary  flame"; 
Pp  -  relating  to  the  oxidizer  portion  of  heat,  which  comes  from  the  primary  flame  to  the  burn¬ 
ing  surface. 

As  it  has  been  reported  in  Ref.  [191  regarding  the  preceding  works  of  Beckstead,  for  |3P  the 
value  of  1/3  or  2/3  was  accepted  in  dependence  on  whether  the  mass  ratio  (f/ox)  was  larger  or 
smaller  than  the  stoichiometric  one.  In  this  case,  according  to  the  solution  of  Burke-Schumann, 
the  diffusion  flame  is  inclined,  respectively,  to  the  fuel  or  to  the  oxidizer.  Fraction  of  the  oxi¬ 
dizer  pF,  which  bums  out  in  the  "primary  flame",  is  calculated  geometrically  just  as  in  the  ini¬ 
tial  BDP  model;  (f/ox)sttrich  -stoichiometric  mass  ratio  of  the  fuel  and  oxidizer.  If  mox  -  total 
mass  flow  rate  from  the  oxidizer,  then  moXpF[l+(f/ox)stoich]  is  the  mass  flow  rate  of  the  rea¬ 
gents,  which  bum  out  in  the  primary  flame;  QPF  -  heat  evolution  in  the  primary  flame  calcu¬ 
lated  per  unit  mass  of  the  combustion  products.  The  value  of  £pF  =  x*PF  cmox/A  is  calculated  as 
in  the  initial  BDP  model,  see  (3.36)-(3.38).  By  numerical  calculations  on  the  basis  of  the 
Burke-Schumann  solution  there  are  proposed  the  expressions  for  the  "diffusion"  heights  of 
flame  above  oxidizer  and  binder  (3.103),  (3.104).  The  last  term  in  (3.125)  considers  the  heat 
feedback  from  the  inherent  flame  of  the  oxidizer  (see  Chapter  1  and  Section  3.3.2).  The  heat 
feedback  from  the  final  flame  is  not  considered.  The  surface  of  oxidizer  is  considered  flat. 

Rate  Uf  of  bum  out  of  the  binder  under  primary  flame  is  found  from  relationship  (3.88)  and  the 
balance  of  heat: 

C{rsf  —fQ  f  +  (l  -  ) '  /  [l  +  (/  /  OX)  sloich  r  '  QpF  eXP(_^PF  )  (3.126) 

Here  the  first  term  in  the  right  hand  side  considers  heat  consumption  on  the  vaporization  of  the 
binder,  the  second  term  corresponds  to  the  heat  feedback  from  the  primary  flame  to  the  binder. 
For  f  the  “semi-empirical"  expression  is  proposed 

/  =  1.2/f(V298)«*p(-  Spf  )  (3.127) 

where  fF  -  binder, which  is  needed  for  the  stoichiometric  reaction  with  the  oxidizer  in  the  pri¬ 
mary  flame. 

Calculations  according  to  the  model  presented  were  performed  for  SP  based  on  octogen  and 
HTPB  binder  (polybutadiene  with  hydroxyl  terminal  groups).  This  binder  is  inert  and  rela¬ 
tively  thermoresistant  while  octogen,  on  the  contrary,  has  low  melting  point  and  high  burning 
rate.  Such  conditions  are  favorable  for  applying  relay  race  type  models.  It  has  been  reported 
[35, 21]  that  calculations  agreed  well  with  experiments  described  in  [33,  34]. 

3.5.3.  Critical  discussion  of  the  “relay  race”  models. 

Let  us  compare  materials  of  Sections  3.4  and  3.5.  The  characteristic  for  the  “relay  race”  mod¬ 
els  the  "successive"  method  of  averaging  (average  over  time)  does  not  formally  have  the  ex¬ 
plicit  advantages  over  the  "parallel"  method,  i.e.,  by  averaging  over  the  surface.  In  the  "paral¬ 
lel"  method  the  real  surface  of  binder  everywhere  differs  from  plane,  in  the  "successive"  -  the 


3 — 48 


normal  to  the  burning  surface  everywhere  differs  from  normal  to  the  plane  section  of  speci¬ 
men.  The  errors  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude  do  not  permit  to  make  simple  evaluation. 
However,  "successive"  averaging  can  be  considered  preferable  for  SP  with  hardly  volatilizing 
binder  or  with  the  fast  burning  filler,  and  also  with  the  large  size  of  the  filler  grains.  For  exam¬ 
ple,  for  the  fast  burning  oxidizer  the  “relay  race”  model  predicts  (see  (3.114))  that  with  small 
changes  in  the  parameters  the  general  burning  rate  of  SP  varies  proportional  to  the  rate  of  the 
bum  out  of  binder.  The  “petite  ensemble”  model  predicts  the  opposite,  namely,  the  determin¬ 
ing  role  of  the  fast  burning  component.  Contradiction  is  caused  by  the  fact  that  with  a  large 
difference  in  the  burning  rates  of  components  according  to  the  “petite  ensemble”  model  there 
appears  too  many  "empty  pits",  and  this  (see  Section  3.3.6)  decreases  the  plausibility  of  model. 

However,  developed  at  the  present  time  “relay  race”  models  are  also  distant  from  perfection. 
Actually,  enumerated  above  conditions,  favorable  for  applying  sequential  models,  simultane¬ 
ously  contribute  to  manifestation  of  nonuniform  effects  connected  with  bending  of  surface  and 
with  gas-dynamics  non-uniform  character.  The  latter  even  on  the  flat  surface  of  SP  can  be 
caused  by  a  difference  in  mass  burning  rates  of  individual  components.  Strong  non-uniform 
character  of  gas  flow  affects  the  character  of  heat  feedback  from  the  gas  phase  and  changes  it 
as  compared  with  that,  which  is  postulated  in  the  models  of  the  BDP  type.  Actually,  the  heat 
transfer  by  convection  is  supplemented.  For  the  coarse  D0  >  k/u  grains  of  filler  the  non-  uni¬ 
form  character  is  developed  also  in  the  condensed  phase:  the  temperature  heterogeneities  do 
not  manage  to  be  leveled  and  the  balance  of  heat  with  the  averaging  of  heat  fluxes  over  the 
surface  of  SP  looses  correct  physical  meaning. 

In  fact,  the  heat  exchange  does  not  manage  to  level  the  heterogeneity  of  the  temperature  in  the 
condensed  phase  not  only  between  the  components  (this  fact  was  taken  into  account  in  Ref. 
[21]  by  using  separate  balances  of  heat  for  the  oxidizer  and  for  the  binder),  but  also  even  be¬ 
tween  the  center  section  and  the  periphery  of  one  large  AP  particle.  Apparently,  for  suffi¬ 
ciently  coarse  grains  (D0»k/u)  instead  of  the  inherent  in  BDP  type  models  calculation  of  the 
mean  mass  burning  rate  of  the  entire  grain  it  should  be  found  the  rate  of  bum  out  on  its  periph¬ 
ery,  using  in  this  case  the  data  of  experiments  of  the  type  [18]  with  the  laminated  specimens. 
Let  us  note  that  calculation  of  the  burning  rate  on  the  periphery  of  the  filler  grain  (AP  or  ni- 
tramine)  is  necessary  not  only  for  finding  total  mass  flow  rate  from  this  grain  or  its  average 
burning  rate  u0.  It  is  also  needed  for  calculating  the  rate  of  the  bum  out  of  binder  which  must 
depend,  in  particular,  on  change  in  the  time  of  the  burning  rate  of  grain.  In  the  sequential 
model  [21],  the  expressions  (3.122)  and  (3.123)  for  tign  are  obtained  by  processing  experimen¬ 
tal  data  of  Shannon  and  Peterson  [37]  on  the  combustion  of  pressed  specimens  of  AP.  Data 
[37]  do  not  contain  dependence  of  tign  on  the  compacting  pressure  Pcomp  although  it  is  evident 
that  when  PCOmp— >  00  the  specimen  bums  as  single  crystal,  but  when  PCOmp  — »  0  (free  packing 
charge)  the  most  possible  is  convective  burning.  Furthermore,  it  causes  no  doubts  that  the  ig¬ 
nition  time  of  AP  particle  in  SP,  besides  its  inherent  characteristics,  must  depend  at  least  on 
the  thermal  physical  parameters  of  binder. 

In  the  model  of  Bakhman,  Belyayev  [1]  it  should  be  noted  limited  applicability  of  relation 
(3.115),  which  is  fulfilled  when  (Do/u0)»(df/uf).  Actually,  inequality  Do/df  >  1  cannot  be  too 
strong  for  monodisperse  SP  for  the  purely  geometric  reasons;  therefore  fulfillment  of 
(Do/u0)»(df/uf)  requires  Uf>  u0.  However,  if  the  binder  bums  two  times  more  faster  than  the 


3 — 49 


oxidizer,  sequential  approach  becomes  incorrect:  burning  goes  away  forward  along  the  binder, 
unbumed  oxidizer  is  ejected  into  the  gas  phase.  Consequently,  the  fufillment  of  (3.115)  and 
applicability  of  the  actually  using  condition  u  «  u0  models  of  the  type  of  BDP  are  limited  to 
narrow  region  Uf  ~  u0. 

Let  us  give  several  critical  comments  regarding  “relay  race”  model  approach  [21]. 

a) .  The  entering  in  (3.121)  value  D  of  average  size  of  intersection  of  particle  with  the  normal 
to  the  burning  surface  is  taken  in  the  form  D=D0  (2/3)° 5,  referring  to  Hermance  [12].  It  can  be 
shown  that  this  relation  is  not  applicable  here.  In  Fig.  3.13  the  straight  line  intersects  those 
particles,  whose  centers  are  located  in  a  cylinder  of  D0  diameter  surrounding  straight  line. 
Cylinder’s  volume  is  V  =  7txD2o/4.  Concentration  of  particles  equals  n  =  ZjiyiD3 J 6).  Then  the 
number  of  particles  in  cylinder  equals  N  =  Vn  =  3£x/2D0.  By  equating  this  expression  with 
(3.120),  we  obtain  D  =  (2/3)  D0 

b) .  Expression  (3.124)  for  the  pyrolysis  rate  of  binder  outside  the  “primary  flame”,  u*f~u  exp(- 
Ufd/2K)  does  not  have  concrete  physical  meaning.  It  was  introduced  in  [38]  simply  as  an  ex¬ 
ample  of  nonlinear  dependence  for  u*f(d). 

c) .  Finally,  by  comparing  the  terms  describing  heat  evolution  in  the  balances  of  heat  (3.125) 
and  (3.126)  and  taking  into  account  that  Qpf  relies  on  the  unit  of  mass  of  reacting  mixture,  it  is 
possible  to  draw  conclusion  that  portion  f  of  binder  reacts  in  “primary  flame"  in  stoichiometric 
ratio,  that  contradicts  determination  of  fF  in  (3.127). 

3.5.4.  Effect  of  heat  losses  into  inclusions. 

Let  us  examine  combustion  of  SP  based  on  energetic  binder  (it  can  be  also  inert  binder  filled  with 
ultrafine  oxidizer)  capable  of  relatively  fast  self-sustaining  burning  [45].  In  this  case  coarse  parti¬ 
cles  of  filler,  e.g.,  oxidizer,  metal,  etc.  become  effectively  involved  in  chemical  transformations 
mostly  on  a  rather  far  distance  from  the  burning  surface  where  they  are  heated  up  to  the  high 
enough  temperature.  At  the  same  time,  in  the  vicinity  of  the  leading  edges  of  the  flame,  which 
penetrate  into  binder  layer,  the  relatively  cool  heterogeneous  inclusions  play  a  role  of  local  heat 
sinks,  retarding  the  burning  rate. 

Before  examining  the  system  with  coarse  inclusions  it  is  convenient  to  consider  another  extreme 
situation  with  inert  and  very  fine  additive  that  makes  the  system  quasi  homogeneous.  If  T*  is  the 
temperature  of  the  rate  control  zone,  the  heat  expenditure  to  warm  up  the  inert  inclusions,  with 
mass  fraction  Y  and  specific  heat  cadd,  equals  AQ=  caddY(T*-To).  From  physical  considerations 
the  effect  of  AQ  on  the  burning  rate  is  the  same  as  lowering  [46]  the  initial  temperature  by  ATo: 

caddY(T*-To)=  cAT0  (3.128) 

Here  c  is  the  mean  specific  heat  of  the  system.  Further,  let  we  consider  the  known  from  experi¬ 
ment  the  burning  rate  temperature  coefficient  P  =  d  In  u/dTo  for  the  original  system  (without  ad¬ 
ditives).  Then  the  ratio  of  the  burning  rates  for  the  systems  with  and  without  additives  can  be 
taken  approximately  in  the  form: 

z=u/u0=l  -pAT0=l-yY;  y  =  (Cadd/c)(T*  -  T0)  (3.129) 

According  to  estimations  the  value  of  y  for  typical  AP  based  formulations  is  close  to  unity. 

Analysing  now  the  case  with  coarse  size  inclusions  one  may  conclude  that  equivalent  decrease  in 
initial  temperature  has  to  be  smaller  than  in  the  case  of  fine  inclusion  particles.  This  is  due  to  less 


3—50 


effective  heat  exchange  between  binder  layer  and  coarse  inclusions.  Thus,  it  is  proposed  [45] 
similar  to  above  expression  for  z: 

Z  =  1-  PAT  where  AT  =  ATo[l  -  exp(-bict/L2]. 

Here  b  is  the  constant,  which  depends  on  the  conditions  of  heat  exchange;  K  is  the  thermal  diffu- 
sivity  of  binder;  L  is  the  half  of  the  binder  layer  width;  x  =  d/uo,  where  d  is  the  inclusion  diame¬ 
ter,  uo  is  the  burning  rate  of  the  system  without  additives.  Based  on  geometrical  considerations, 
the  value  of  L  can  be  estimated  approximately  as  L  =  d(K^'1/3  -  1),  where  £,  is  the  volume  fraction 
of  the  inclusions  and  k  is  the  constant  of  the  order  of  unity  magnitude.  Combination  of  the  above 
expressions  leads  to  relationship  that  can  be  used  for  treatment  of  the  experimental  data  on  the 
burning  rate  variations: 

In  [1  -  (1-z)  /  yY]  =  -  bK/u0d(K^,/3  -  l)2  (3.130) 

Experimental  results  were  obtained  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  processed  by  expression  (3.130). 
The  homogenized  matrix  consisted  of  AP  with  size  less  than  10  micron,  rubber  and  8%  of  cata¬ 
lyst  was  used  as  fast  burning  binder.  The  burning  rate  of  matrix  comprised  7  mm/s.  Fairly  well 
fitting  of  the  experimental  data  by  expression  (3.130)  tells  in  favor  of  “workability”  of  the  ap¬ 
proach  under  discussion.  Actually,  all  types  of  additives  to  the  system  with  fast  burning  matrix 
cause  retardation  of  the  burning  rate  because  of  the  common  physics  of  the  process,  namely,  due 
to  heat  losses  from  the  combustion  zone  for  “inert”  warming  up  the  inclusions  material. 

The  approach  described  can  be  partially  improved  if  one  calculates  x  =  d/uo  using  value  of  actual 
burning  rate  u  instead  of  uo  that  may  give  possibility  to  predict  the  combustion  limits  for  the  sys¬ 
tem.  In  particular,  if  one  uses  simplified  relationship  for  z  in  the  form  u/uo  ~  exp  (-Bkx/L2)  with  x 
=  d/u,  the  condition  for  flame  quenching  takes  the  form  z*  =  e’1  (according  to  the  experiment  [45] 
z*  =  0.3  that  is  close  to  this  estimation).  In  addition,  it  might  be  useful  to  take  into  consideration 
the  temperature  distribution  inside  inclusions  and  examine  the  effect  of  their  thermophysical  pa¬ 
rameters  on  the  burning  rate.

STATIONARY  COMBUSTION  OF  HETEROGENEOUS  SYSTEMS  WITH  POLYDIS- 
PERSE  COMPONENTS. 

Polydisperse  compositions  contain  particles  of  filler  of  different  sizes.  The  developments  of  the 
combustion  models  for  polydisperse  SP  is  urgent  for  two  reasons.  First,  ideally  monodisperse 
compositions  do  not  occur  in  practice,  there  are  compositions  with  the  more  or  less  narrow  frac¬ 
tions  of  filler.  Secondly  (and  this  is  main  thing),  polydisperse  compositions  possess  the  important 
advantage  for  practice  because  they  make  it  possible  to  obtain  the  highest  degree  of  filler  loading 
needed  to  approach  the  stoichiometric  ratio  between  the  fuel  and  the  oxidizer  in  the  SP  formula¬ 
tion  and  to  obtain  the  maximum  specific  impulse  in  the  rocket  motor. 

Theoretical  models  of  solid  propellant  combustion  describing  dependence  on  of  burning  rate  the 
oxidizer  particles  size  were  developed  intensely  for  period  of  last  there  decades  by  the  combus¬ 
tion  experts  throughout  the  world.  In  the  original  works  by  Manelis  and  Strunin  (see  Chapter  3), 
by  Summerfield  [1]  and  Bakhman  and  Belyayev  [2],  the  initial  set  of  particles  was  substituted  by 
the  conditionally  monodisperse  powder  with  a  certain  characteristic  size,  determined  using  the 
assigned  method.  This  approach  made  it  possible  qualitatively  to  correctly  explain  the  depend¬ 
ence  of  burning  rate  on  the  oxidizer  grain  size,  in  particular,  an  increase  in  burning  rate  with  the 
decrease  of  particle  size  and  saturation  of  this  dependence  with  the  small  and  large  particle  sizes. 

Named  approach  proved  to  be  barely  effective  in  description  of  the  laws  governing  combustion 
of  contemporary  SP,  which  contain,  as  a  rule,  several  fractions  of  oxidizer.  The  demand  arose  for 
the  development  of  the  more  advanced  models,  which  consider  the  wide  collection  of  the  sizes  of 
the  oxidizer  particles. 

4.1.  EXTENSION  OF  THE  UTD-MODEL  FOR  HETEROGENEOUS  MIXTURES 


It  is  natural  to  take  account  of  the  polydisperse  size  distribution  by  generalization  of  the  mono¬ 
disperse  models  using  developed  methods  of  averaging  the  burning  rate.  It  was  shown  earlier  that 
for  UTD-models  the  averaging  is  conveniently  conducted  through  the  whole  area  of  the  burning 
surface: 

msp  =  AsP ), ;  SP  =  XA5/>  t4-1) 

t  i 

Here  m  -  mean  mass  burning  rate;  sp  -  area  of  the  plane  section  of  specimen,  (mAsp)i  -  “instanta¬ 
neous”  mass  flow  rate  from  the  i-th  particle  of  filler  and  portion  of  binder  that  occupy  the  "re¬ 
lated"  to  this  particle  area  on  the  SP  surface  with  projection  Asp,i  on  section  sp  of  the  initial 
specimen.  Summation  is  performed  through  all  particles,  represented  on  the  surface.  Sum  expres¬ 
sion  in  (4.1)  can  be  classified  into  the  narrow  fractions  AD0  of  the  filler  particles  (here  D0  -  origi¬ 
nal  diameter  of  the  filler  particle,  but  not  its  intersection  with  sp:

where  j  -  number  of  the  narrow  fraction.  For  fixed  j  the  values  of  AsPitl  are  the  areas  of  sections, 
connected  with  different  sections  of  the  same  size  particles  (fraction  j)  arrived  on  the  burning  sur¬ 
face  of  AP.  In  addition,  for  the  equation  of  the  heat  balance  in  condensed  phase  it  is  necessary  to 
know  analogous  sum  for  the  heat  flux  q  into  the  condensed  phase: 


&  p 


=XfeA0,  =Z 


(4.2) 


In  order  to  switch  over  to  the  distribution  functions,  we  may  formally  use  that  introduced  by 
Glick  and  Condon  [3]  concept  of  pseudo-propellant.  For  this  end  let  us  call  the  set  of  surfaces 
Asp  n  from  internal  sums  (4.1)  and  (4.2),  relating  to  the  j-th  narrow  fraction  of  filler,  as  the  sur¬ 
face  of  the  j-th  pseudo-propellant: 


XA*P,"  =  Asp» 


(4.3) 


and  let  us  represent  internal  sums  themselves  in  the  form 


=mJAsp,j’ 


K  »  Ji 


flXA^,nl 


=  Vj^pj 


\  »  Ji 


(4.4) 


(4.4’) 


Further,  let  us  call  values  of  mj  and  qj  as  the  mass  burning  rate  and  heat  flux  into  the  condensed 
phase  for  the  pseudo-propellant  related  to  the  narrow  filler  fraction  j. 

The  prefix  "pseudo"  indicates,  first  of  all,  that  the  discussion  deals  with  the  complex  geometry 
part  of  SP,  mentally  isolated  in  the  bulk  of  the  specimen.  Besides,  one  should  keep  in  mind  that 
depending  on  the  method  of  distributing  the  binder  between  the  fractions  of  oxidizer  it  may  hap¬ 
pen  that  some  fractions  (with  largest  grains)  “obtain”  too  little  binder.  When  taking  such  fraction 
and  “related”  to  this  fraction  binder,  we  may  not  be  able  to  manufacture  real  solid  propellant  be¬ 
cause  of  the  lack  of  binder:  the  SP  will  contain  many  voids.  Area  Aspj  can  be  presented  in  the 
form  [3] 

ASp,J=Aspox,j^j> 

where  Aspox,j  -  area  of  plane  section  occupied  with  the  j  narrow  filler  fraction  (j  pseudo-propellant. 
The  above  expression  can  be  rewritten  in  another  form  keeping  in  mind  that  the  “surface”  frac¬ 
tion  equals  the  volume  fraction  £(Do)  of  oxidizer  in  pseudo-propellant  j 

A  _  ^f_pOXj  S_pOX  Sp

** pox  ** p  =  j

where  spox  -  total  cross-sectional  area  occupied  with  oxidizer.  Similarly,  it  is  possible  to  replace 
spox/sp  =  C;  C  -  volume  fraction  of  oxidizer  for  entire  composition.  Assuming  chaotic  particle  dis¬ 
tribution  one  obtains  Asp0x,j/sPox  =  AV0x,j/V0x  since  the  “surface”  fraction  of  the  j-th  oxidizer  frac¬ 
tion  in  the  plane  section  of  initial  specimen  is  equal  to  its  volume  fraction.  If  the  oxidizer  of  the 
same  material  is  used,  then  the  volume  fraction  is  equal  to  the  mass  fraction  AM0x,j/M0x.  Then 
after  passage  to  the  limit  ADo— >  0  it  follows  from  (4.1): 


Here  m(Do),  £(D0)  -  m  and  C,  for  the  pseudo-propellant  with  the  size  of  particles  Do;  F(D0)  -  dis¬ 
tribution  function:

(4.6) 


For  the  only  fraction  of  oxidizer  the  function  F(Do),  as  a  rule,  is  described  well  by  the  logarithmi¬ 
cally  normal  distribution  function

where  Fk  is  determined  by  (4.  6)  with  coefficients  ok,  (in  D0 ) .  To  find  the  entering  into  (4.5)  term 

£(Do),  let  us  assume  according  to  [3],  that  the  mean  volume  of  the  binder,  which  bums  together 
with  the  particles  of  diameter  D0,  is  equal  to  Avb=CD0n,  where  n  is  taken  from  experiment  (2<  n 
<3).  Value  of  C  depends  on  the  formulation  of  the  propellant  (see  below).  Then,  regarding  to 
definition  of  C(Do),  one  obtains 

C(D„ )  =  H3  /  4(«OoJ  /  6)  +  CD;  ]  =  (l  +  (6  C  /It  )£>r3 )“  (4.9) 


Let  us  find  value  of  C  from  the  condition 

l-C  =  |Avi,(D0)rfiV  (4.10) 

Here  (1-Q  -  the  volume  of  binder  in  1  cm3  of  propellant;  dN  -  number  of  the  particles  of  oxidizer 
with  size  in  the  range  between  Do  and  Do+dDo  in  1cm3  of  propellant,  dN  =  dvox/(7tD03/6).  The 
value  of  dvox  can  be  taken  from  (4.6),  setting  there  v0X=C  (per  unit  of  volume  of  propellant).  Then

In  the  original  work  of  Glick  and  Condon  [3]  the  total  heat  balance  in  condensed  phase  was  not 
used.  Expression  for  the  mean  heat  flux  can  be  derived  similarly  to  that  how  it  was  derived  (4.5):

Expressions  (4.5)  and  (4.12)  for  m  and  q  are  obtained  without  specific  assumptions  about  physics 
of  process  (it  is  postulated  only  randomness  of  particle  distribution  in  SP)  and  therefore  are  al¬ 
ways  valid.  Since  in  (4.1)  the  value  (mAsp)i  has  a  meaning  of  the  mass  flow  rate  (without  indica¬ 
tion  of  the  phase  state)  from  the  surface  of  SP,  which  corresponds  to  area  Aspj  of  the  plane  sec¬ 
tion  of  specimen,  expression  (4.5)  remains  correct  upon  the  dispersion  of  the  part  of  the  filler  and 
binder. 

Let  us  stress  the  formal  character  of  definitions  (4.4)  and  (4.4)’  for  entering  in  (4.5)  and  (4.12)  the 
burning  rate  my  =  m(D0)  and  heat  flux  qj  =  q(D0)  for  the  pseudo-propellant  related  to  the  size  of 
particles  D0.  The  averaging  in  (4.4),  (4.4)'  is  conducted  through  surface  Aspj  of  the  j-th  pseudo¬ 
propellant,  which  consists  of  the  scattered  over  section  sp  of  specimen  small  aria  "patches”  Asp>n. 
In  fact,  the  averaging  of  the  heat  flux  by  (4.4)  even  under  conditions  of  UTD-models  (D«/ku) 
does  not  have  its  physical  analog  -  the  smoothing  of  the  heat  fluxes  in  the  condensed  phase  near 
the  burning  surface. 

In  concrete  UTD-models,  when  describing  the  polydisperse  version,  entering  in  (4.5)  and  (4.12) 
values  of  m(D0)  and  q(D0 )  are  calculated  with  utilization  of  monodisperse  version.

4.1.  Dependence  of  burning  rate  on  filler  particle  size  distribution  [8]. 


4 — 4 


Most  simply  account  of  polydisperse  size  distribution  appears  in  the  Hermance  model  [4]  (mono- 
disperse  version  see  in  Section  3.3.1).  Connected  with  one  particle  of  oxidizer  the  mass  flow  rate 
from  the  condensed  phase  and  the  heat  feedback  from  the  gas  phase  according  to  (3.22),  (3.25), 
(3.27)  linearly  depend  on  Dc  e(Dc),  where  e(Dc)  -  depth  of  the  binder  depression  near  the  crystal 
of  the  oxidizer  (see  Fig.  4.1);  Dc  -  diameter  of  the  section  of  initial  crystal  (without  taking  into 
account  its  burning)  by  the  plane  of  binder.  Therefore  needed  for  calculation  of  m(D0)  and  q(D0) 
averaging  by  (4.4)  and  (4.4)’  is  reduced  to  the  averaging  of  the  value  Dc  e(Dc)  over  the  sections  of 
the  particles  of  the  pseudo-propellant,  related  with  size  of  D0  of  particles.  In  Ref.  [4]  this  opera¬ 
tion  is  substituted  by  the  calculation  of  known  function  Do  e(Do)  at  Dc  =  D0V 2/3 .  In  this  case 
the  use  of  “polydisperse"  expressions  (4.5),  (4.12)  for.  m  and  q  is  reduced  to  the  fact  that  the  fol¬ 
lowing  integral,  is  substituted  into  the  balances  (3.22),  (3.27)  of  mass  and  heat  instead  of  the  av¬ 
erage  for  the  oxidizer  mono-fraction  expression  <  Dce(Dc)>, 


(D,  ■  t(D, ))  =  J (Dc  •  e(D,  ))F(D„  )d  In  D,  (4.13) 


In  the  model  of  Hermance  there  is  no  need  to  define  the  method  of  distributing  the  binder  be¬ 
tween  the  particles  of  oxidizer.  Therefore  for  the  pseudo-propellants  it  is  possible  to  take,  for  ex¬ 
ample,  C(Do)=  const  =  £,  and  it  becomes  clear  by  what  manner  the  utilization  of  (4.5)  and  (4.12) 
with  the  linear  dependence  of  q(Do)  and  m(Do)  on  <  Dc  e(Dc)>  gives  (4.13).  In  Ref.  [4],  function 
F(Do)  is  taken  in  the  form  close  to  the  expression  of  (4.8)  type  for  two  logarithmically  normal 
distributions,  and  instead  of  integral  (4.13)  two  sums  are  used. 

Cohen's  survey  [5]  reported  about  polydisperse  versions  of  the  BDP  model.  It  is  assumed  that  the 
binder  on  the  entire  SP  surface  has  identical  temperature  Tsf  and  the  burning  rate  mf.  The  burning 
surface  of  binder  is  plane.  For  the  oxidizer  corresponding  values  Tsox  and  mox  depend  on  the  size 
of  particles  Do.  In  this  case  instead  of  (4.5)  one  may  use  equivalent  expression  (4.14),  which  de¬ 
pends  only  on  the  burning  rate  of  the  oxidizer: 

+°° 

am  =  J  mp  ox  ( D0  )F  (D0  )d  In  D0  (4.14)

Here  a  -  mass  fraction  of  oxidizer;  mpox=  mox(Do)sox(Do)/Spox(Do)  -  mean  mass  flow  rate  1  cm  of 
that  part  of  the  plane  section  of  specimen,  which  is  occupied  with  the  narrow  oxidizer  fraction  of 
the  particles  size  D0.  Values  of  moX(D0)  and  sox(Do)/SpOX(Do)  are  calculated,  as  in  the  original  BDP 
model,  by  (4.30)  and  (4.47).  However,  for  temperature  Tsox(Do),  which  determines  according  to 
(4.30)  the  value  of  mox(Do)  separate  balances  of  heat  are  used  for  each  narrow  oxidizer  fraction 
(and  one  additional  balance  of  heat  for  the  binder).  Total  mean  heat  flux  in  the  form  of  (4.12)  is 
not  used. 

Actually,  polydisperse  versions  of  the  BDP  model  can  be  treated  as  generalization  for  several 
oxidizer  fractions  of  two-temperature  "improved  model"  presented  in  chapter  3.  Limited  number 
(3-4)  of  the  narrow  fractions  is  used;  therefore,  instead  of  integral  (4.14)  sums  are  examined.  The 


4—5 


redistribution  of  heat  fluxes  between  each  fraction  and  binder  is  considered  only  in  the  gas  phase, 
as  in  the  “improved  model".  The  direct  interaction  of  fractions  (redistribution  of  heat  fluxes)  in 
the  published  versions  of  models  is  not  considered. 

If  utilization  of  separate  heat  balance  can  be  considered  as  the  first  step  in  direction  of  isolation  of 
pseudo-propellants,  then  the  “petite  ensemble”  model  [3]  reached  the  logical  end  by  postulating 
complete  independence  of  burning  of  pseudo-propellants. 

For  calculating  the  burning  rate  it  is  proposed  [3]  to  use  relationship  (4.5),  calculating  the  value 
£(Do)  on  the  basis  of  (4.9)  and  (4.11),  and  the  burning  rate  of  pseudo-propellant  m(Do)  -  on  the 
basis  of  presented  in  Chapter  3  model  “petite  ensemble”  for  the  monodisperse  composition  with 
the  size  of  particles  D0  and  the  volume  fraction  of  oxidizer  ^(Do).As  it  is  reported  in  survey  [5], 
the  model  [3]  gives  reasonable  agreement  with  the  experiment  only  in  the  case  of  not  too  strongly 
distinguished  sixes  of  the  oxidizer  grains  of  different  fractions. 

4..2.  EXTENSION  OF  THE  “RELAY  RACE”  TYPE  MODELS 

The  combustion  model  [7]  gives  example  of  polydisperse  version  of  the  “relay  race”  approach. 
We  will  enumerate  here  its  differences  from  the  described  in  Chapter  3  monodisperse  version. 
Expression  for  the  burning  rate  instead  of  (4.14)  takes  the  form 


u  =  x/'Lti  (4.15) 

where  tj  -  transit  time  of  the  combustion  wave  passing  through  the  encountered  on  the  way  parti¬ 
cles  of  the  i-th  narrow  oxidizer  fraction  and  the  "related"  to  them  binder.  Correspondingly,  ex¬ 
pression  (3.121)  is  transformed  into  the  following 

1  / «  =  £  •  &  /  D, )  +  K,  /  O + X, (/,/«,+  (1  ■ -/,)/«; )]  (4.16) 

i 

Here  ^  -  volume  fraction  of  the  propellant,  occupied  with  the  binder,  “related”  to  i-th  fraction  of 
oxidizer.  In  all  "primary  flames"  the  burning  rate  of  the  bum  out  of  binder  Uf  is  assumed  as  iden¬ 
tical.  The  balance  of  heat  for  the  i-th  fraction  of  oxidizer  differs  from  "monodisperse"  balance 
(3.125)  only  in  terms  of  the  fact  that  all  the  values  entering  it  (except  for  c,  T0  and  (f/ox)st0ich  ob¬ 
tained  index  i.  The  heat  balance  for  the  binder  takes  form  (4.17)) 

c(Tsf  -  T0 )  =  -frbQ /  +  2  (l  -  )/,  (l  +  (g  / o)~lih )  Qppi  exp{-  %PFi )  (4. 17) 

i 

where  frb  =  '£lfi  -  portion  of  the  binder,  which  reacts  in  all  "primary  flames".  Model  is  pro- 

i 

posed  for  a  number  of  the  narrow  fractions  not  exceeding  three.  Limitation  is  caused  by  the  ne¬ 
cessity  to  solve  a  bulky  system  of  equations  in  connection  with  the  utilization  of  a  balance  of  heat 
for  each  narrow  fraction. 

Let  us  show  that  the  equation  (4.16)  can  be  easily  generalized  by  analogy  with  [3].  Actually,  by 
examining  an  increasing  number  of  the  narrow  fractions,  one  obtains

Calculations  according  to  the  “relay  race”  model  showed  that  with  the  high  degree  of  SP  loading 
the  dependence  of  burning  rate  on  the  granulometric  composition  (ratio  of  fine  to  coarse  frac¬ 
tions)  becomes  weak.  It  was  revealed  that  the  finest  fraction  of  octogen  determines  the  value  of 
the  burning  rate,  if  its  fraction  mass  comprises  more  than  25%  of  entire  oxidizer.  It  was  also 
noted  that  the  catalysts  weakly  affect  the  burning  rate.  This  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  catalysts 
of  the  used  type  accelerate  the  reactions  of  primary  flame,  but  for  the  octogen  it  is  relatively  cold 
in  comparison  with  its  mono-fuel  flame. 

The  listed  results,  obtained  by  calculation,  are  confirmed  by  experiment.  It  is  reported  in  Ref.  [7] 
that  the  experiments  were  conducted  for  17  different  SP  containing  octogen  and  the  binder 
HTPB.  The  octogen  particles  with  size  of  400,  200,  58  and  4  pm  in  different  ratios  were  intro¬ 
duced  in  SP  formulations.  Pressure  varied  from  28  to  120  atm.  Results  of  calculations  qualita¬ 
tively  and  quantitatively  agreed  with  the  experiments. 

4.3  COMBUSTION  OF  THE  MIXTURES  WITH  DIFFERENT  OXIDIZER  GRAIN  SIZE 


The  model  which  considers  interaction  of  oxidizer  particles  with  strongly  distinguished  sizes,  is 
presented  in  the  appendix  to  Ref.  [6].  In  basic  part  of  the  work  the  authors  applied  for  describing 
the  combustion  of  polydisperse  compositions  their  “improved  model”,  based  on  the  BDP  model. 
In  this  case  the  separate  balances  of  heat  for  the  oxidizer  and  the  binder  and  different  surface 
temperatures  for  these  components  were  used.  The  mass  burning  rate  was  determined  through  the 


4—7 


pseudo-propellant  according  to  the  “petite  ensemble”  approach  [3].  It  was  obtained  a  good 
agreement  with  the  experiment  for  the  formulation  based  on  bimodal  AP  (82%  of  AP,  1  pm/7 pm 
=  1/2;  80%  of  AP,  9pm/90pm  =  1/1;  82%  of  AP,  90|xm/200|xm  =  1/5).  However,  for  the  formu¬ 
lation  with  the  very  strongly  distinguished  AP  fractions  (70%  of  AP,  0.6pm/400|im  =  %;  18%  Al; 
CTPB  binder)  calculated  burning  rate  proved  to  be  3  times  higher  than  experimental  one.  Alumi¬ 
num  was  considered  in  calculation  as  an  inert  additive  (heat  sink).  The  authors  of  [6]  noted  that 
the  better  agreement  can  be  succeeded  if  in  expression  for  the  burning  rate  to  neglect  by  the  con¬ 
tribution  of  the  pseudo-propellant,  which  corresponds  to  the  fine  oxidizer  fraction. 

Analyzing  reasons  for  disagreement,  the  authors  of  [6]  conclude  that  if  binder  is  prorated  to  the 
surface  areas  of  corresponding  oxidizer  fractions  (which  acknowledges  as  reasonable  assump¬ 
tion),  then  pseudo-propellants,  related  to  the  fine  fractions  of  oxidizer,  prove  to  be  enriched  by 
fuel,  and  those  related  to  the  coarse  oxidizer  fractions  -  depleted  by  fuel. 

As  a  result,  both  pseudo-propellant  types  have  a  temperature  of  flame  considerably  lower  than 
with  the  stoichiometric  ratio  of  components,  whence  follows  sharply  decreased  burning  rate  of 
SP.  Opposite  effect  is  obtained  if  we  take  the  proposition  of  Beckstead  [7]:  for  any  ratios  of  fuel 
the  temperature  of  flame  to  consider  maximally  possible,  and  namely,  the  same  as  for  the  stoichi¬ 
ometric  ratio.  The  reason  for  such  proposition  is  that  precisely  these  temperatures  are  reached  at 
the  front  of  purely  diffusion  flame.  The  deviation  of  the  ratio  of  components  from  the  stoichi¬ 
ometric  affects,  according  to  Beckstead,  only  the  height  of  the  flame. 

Concerning  results  of  analysis  of  question  about  temperature  of  flame  the  authors  of  [6]  drew  a 
conclusion  about  insufficient  validity  of  both  approaches  and  proposed  new  one.  For  the  formu¬ 
lations  containing  several  narrow  fractions  of  oxidizer,  which  are  sharply  distinguished  by  the 
particle  sixes,  the  concept  of  modified  pseudo-propellants  connected  with  these  fractions  is  intro¬ 
duced.  Pseudo-propellants  in  Cohen-Strand  radically  differ  from  the  pseudo-propellants  in  Glick- 
Condon.  Thus,  according  to  Glick-Condon  the  SP  consists  of  the  system  of  independently  burn¬ 
ing  pseudo-propellants,  but  according  to  Cohen-Strand  the  SP  with  fractions  of  oxidizer  strongly 
distinguished  by  the  particle  size  is  comprised  of  the  series  of  “those  inserted"  one  in  another  of 
pseudo-propellants.  In  this  case  for  each  subsequent  pseudo-propellant  the  preceding  one  (con¬ 
nected  with  the  finer  oxidizer  fraction)  serves  as  the  active  binder.  Initial  pseudo-propellant  con¬ 
sists  of  oxidizer  of  the  finest  fraction  and  entire  binder.  {To  be  more  accurate,  almost  entire.  Ac¬ 
cording  to  Ref.  [6],  the  binder  is  divided  between  the  fractions  proportional  to  their  surface.  For 
example,  in  the  composition  with  the  fractions  of  AP  0.6 pm/400 jum  =  3/4  the  binder  is  divided 
between  the  fractions  in  the  ratio  (3/0.6)/4/400)  =  500/1).  The  latter  pseudo-propellant  coincides 
with  the  propellant  incomplete  formulation. 

Thus,  the  pseudo-propellant  connected  with  given  fraction  of  oxidizer  can  be  in  complete  manu¬ 
factured,  if  from  the  prepared  for  the  mixing  components  to  retract  the  coarsest  (larger  than  given 
size)  fractions  of  oxidizer.  The  temperature  of  flame  for  each  pseudo-propellant  is  determined  by 
thermodynamic  calculation  by  its  composition.  For  each  of  the  pseudo-propellants,  that  com¬ 
prises  finally  the  SP  formulation,  the  ratio  fuel/oxidizer  is  not  less  than  that  for  the  whole  SP 
(there  are  no  pseudo-propellants  with  the  temperature  of  flame,  which  is  sharply  reduced  due  to 
the  strong  excess  of  oxidizer). 


4—8 


The  interaction  of  the  flames  of  different  pseudo-propellants  is  considered  in  the  following  way. 
According  to  the  ."improved  model"  with  its  separate  balances  of  heat  for  the  oxidizer  and  the 
binder  it  is  possible  to  calculate  for  a  given  pseudo-propellant  which  part  of  the  heat  from  its 
flame  falls  to  the  appropriate  active  binder,  i.e.,  to  the  pseudo-propellant  of  the  lower  rank. 

For  the  mentioned  composition  with  distribution  of  AP  onto  fractions  of  0.6jxm/400|im  =  3/4  the 
burning  rate  was  calculated  according  to  “improved  model"  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  the 
binder  and  AP  fraction  of  0.6pm  together  are  active  binder  for  the  AP  fraction  of  400  pm.  Cal¬ 
culation  demonstrated  a  good  agreement  with  the  experiment. 

It  should  be  noted  that  idea  of  a  pseudo-propellant  as  an  active  binder  analog  has  been  discussed 
previously  by  Bakhman  and  Belyayev  [1].  They  examined  a  possibility  of  use  of  the  of  “relay 
race”  type  model  (when  the  burning  rate  of  the  oxidizer  crystals  of  coarse  fraction  is  more  than 
the  burning  rate  of  active  binder).  It  was  also  examined  the  contradictory  version,  when  active 
binder  bums  more  rapidly.  However,  their  approach  did  not  include  interaction  between  the 
flames  of  coarse  oxidizer  and  active  binder. 

4.4.  DISCUSSION  OF  THE  COMBUSTION  MODELS  FOR  HETEROGENEOUS  CON¬ 
DENSED  SYSTEM. 

Models  of  combustion  of  polydisperse  SP  are  constructed  on  a  basis  of  monodisperse  models  and 
therefore  they  absorb  all  the  complexities  and  contradictions,  noted  in  preceding  Sections.  The 
difficulties  can  only  be  aggravated  due  to  strengthening  of  the  heterogeneity  of  the  parameters  on 
the  burning  surface  of  SP  containing  polydisperse  filler. 

Polydisperse  versions  of  UTD-models  and  “relay  race”  type  models  are  discussed  below.  Pre¬ 
sented  in  survey  [5]  polydisperse  versions  of  the  models  of  Beckstead  and  Cohen,  and  also  (espe¬ 
cially)  the  model  of  Glick  and  Condon  have  essential  deficiency.  Thus,  in  the  models  of  Beck- 
stead  and  Cohen  different  fractions  of  oxidizer  interact  only  through  the  gas  phase  [5]. 

In  this  case  part  of  the  heat  of  "primary  flames"  is  delivered  to  the  binder.  In  the  model  of  Glick 
and  Condon  the  interaction  is  not  considered  at  all:  the  pseudo-  propellants,  connected  with  dif¬ 
ferent  fractions  of  oxidizer,  bum  completely  independently. 

At  the  same  time  these  models  use  balances  of  heat  for  different  fractions  of  oxidizer  or  for  dif¬ 
ferent  pseudo-  propellants,  which  is  admissible  only  with  Do«k/u,  i.e.,  within  the  framework  of 
UTD-models.  Using  in  the  mentioned  balances  of  heat  a  concept  of  mean  temperature  of  surface 
and  mean  heat  flux,  we  thereby  assume  redistribution  in  the  condensed  phase  (near  the  surface) 
of  the  heat  flux,  which  enters  the  condensed  phase.  However,  this  redistribution  between  the  par¬ 
ticles  of  the  chosen  narrow  fraction  or  between  scattered  in  the  volume  of  SP  pieces  of  the  chosen 
pseudo-propellant  is  simply  impossible  without  the  interaction  in  the  condensed  phase  with  their 
other  ambient  medium. 

Obviously,  within  the  framework  of  UTD-models  there  is  need  for  account  of  introduced  by  the 
filler  polydisperse  size  distribution  the  non-uniformity  of  parameters  across  the  SP  surface  (tem¬ 
perature,  heat  flux  from  gas  phase,  curvature,  etc.).  In  particular,  this  can  be  done  as  follows:  to 


4—9 


separate  in  the  condensed  phase  near  the  surface  of  SP  the  layer  with  a  thickness  of  ~  max(Do), 
that  has  the  bent  interface  with  the  gas  phase  and  plane  interface  with  the  remaining  volume  of 
sample.  On  the  plane  boundary  it  is  possible  to  use  balance  of  heat  total  for  entire  sample  taking 
into  account  an  expression  of  type  of  (4.12)  for  the  heat  flux.  For  the  chosen  layer  one  must  solve 
complex  (multi-dimensional)  problem  about  the  redistribution  of  heat  fluxes;  however,  it  is  pos¬ 
sible  to  hope  that  in  this  case  the  account  of  the  relatively  small  thickness  of  this  layer  max  D0  « 
k/u  will  result  in  some  simplifications. 

Coming  to  discussion  of  “relay  race”  model  [7],  we  may  note  that  its  polydisperse  version  does 
not  contain  errors,  introduced  upon  consideration  of  different  particle  size.  It  is  presented  in  Sec¬ 
tion  3.5.2  the  monodisperse  version  the  assumption  was  used  about  independent  bum  out  of  dif¬ 
ferent  (including  those  adjacent)  particles  of  filler  and  interlayers  of  binder,  which  lay  on  the 
same  normal  to  the  burning  surface  of  sample  (see  Fig.  3.13).  Therefore,  the  introduction  of  dif¬ 
ferent  particle  sizes  did  not  introduce  additional  contradictions.  Only  deficiencies  in  the  mono¬ 
disperse  version  of  the  model  can  be  recognized,  and  the  main  of  them  —  non-consistency  be¬ 
tween  the  method  of  averaging  over  time,  giving  the  greatest  effect  with  Do»k/u,  and  calcula¬ 
tion  of  "local"  burning  rate  by  the  BDP  model  mostly  efficient  with  D0«k/u. 

There  are,  however,  “favorable”  circumstances.  First  of  all,  the  main  thing  in  the  Beckstead 
model  is  the  method  of  averaging  along  normal  to  the  surface  of  combustion.  It  can  be  combined 
with  any  model  of  the  combustion  of  single  particles,  including  those  with  particles  interaction. 
Secondly,  the  BDP  model  that  was  not  designed  for  the  application  in  the  case  of  a  thin  preheated 
layer  (since  it  uses  the  heat  balance,  based  on  the  averaging  of  heat  fluxes  over  the  surface,  to 
which  the  real  process  must  correspond  of  redistributing  the  heat  in  a  thick  preheated  layer),  may 
give  accurate  result  because  with  a  thin  preheated  layer  an  oxidizer  bums  with  its  actual  speed. 
Therefore,  at  least  for  thin  preheated  layers  the  BDP  model  is  not  contradictory. 

“Pseudo-propellant”  model,  proposed  by  Bakhman,  Belyayev  [1]  and  elaborated  in  detail  by 
Cohen,  Strand  [6],  is  extremely  useful,  although  it  is  applicable  mainly  to  compositions  with  oxi¬ 
dizer  fractions  very  strongly  distinguished  by  particle  size.  In  the  model  [6]  the  main  disadvan¬ 
tage  in  the  widespread  model  of  Glick-Condon  is  reduced,  namely,  the  independence  of  the  com¬ 
bustion  of  pseudo-propellants.  The  idea  of  the  “inserted”  pseudo-propellants  possesses  the  suffi¬ 
cient  generality:  the  burning  rate  of  each  pseudo-propellant  can  be  calculated  not  compulsorily  by 
the  "improved  model"  or  other  model  of  the  BDP  type  with  the  averaging  of  burning  rate  over  the 
surface.  It  is  completely  admissible  here  the  application  of  “relay  race”  models  (especially  for  the 
pseudo-propellants,  related  to  the  coarsest  oxidizer  fractions). 

Let  us  demonstrate  application  of  "pseudo-propellant"  model  [1,  6]  for  explanation  of  one  ex¬ 
perimental  finding  (Miller's  experiments  [8].)  The  burning  rate  of  29  nonmetalized  compositions 
was  determined  for  seven  different  pressures  (from  0.7  to  200  atm).  Nature  and  overall  content  of 
binder  and  oxidizer  (AP)  in  all  compositions  were  identical,  the  ratio  of  AP  fractions  was 
changed  only.  The  fractions  of  particles  400,  200, 90,  50,  20,  6,  2  and  0.7  pm  were  used. 

It  was  reported  that  with  accuracy  not  less  than  15%  the  data  of  experiment  coincide  with  the  re¬ 
sults  of  calculation  according  to  the  modified  BDP  model  and  according  to  the  Glick-Condon 
model.  It  proved  to  be  that  at  fixed  pressure  all  experimental  data  (for  25  compositions  with  es- 


4—10 


sentially  distinguished  distribution  of  AP)  with  good  accuracy  can  be  fitted  by  one  curve  in  coor¬ 
dinates  u  (burning  rate)  and  characteristic  size  d3,4;2,4: 


^3, 4;  2,4 


5>a3'4  /Xm.2'4 


where  nj  -  number  of  particles,  which  have  diameter  dj.  Summation  is  performed  over  all  i- 
numbers. 


However,  data  on  four  formulations  with  coarse  AP  fraction  (400  pm)  did  not  correspond  to  gen¬ 
eral  dependence  (Fig.  4.1).  In  these  formulations  the  content  of  coarse  fraction  comprised  more 
than  half  of  the  mass  of  entire  oxidizer,  and  the  ratio  of  fine  fractions  was  sharply  different,  so 
that  value  D3>4;2,4  for  these  four  compositions  was  substantially  different  (see  Fig.  4.1).  Nonethe¬ 
less  the  rate  of  combustion  virtually  coincided  for  these  four  compositions,  as  if  fine  AP  fractions 
did  not  give  a  contribution  to  integral  (4.5).  Miller  considers  that  "the  combustion  of  fine  AP 
fraction  was  suppressed”,  and  focuses  attention  on  uneven  (with  the  increase  of  the  portion  of  the 
coarse  AP  fraction  only  by  2%)  character  of  the  burning  rate  behavior.  Data  of  Miller  agree  with 
the  results  calculations  by  Cohen,  Strand  [6]  (see  Section  4.1.3  for  SP,  containing  70%  of  AP; 
0.6pm/400pm  =  3/4;  18%  Al,  and  binder  CTPB).  The  agreement  of  calculations  by  the  Glick- 
Condon  model  with  Miller’s  experiment  in  this  particular  case  was  reached  only  after  disregard¬ 
ing  contribution  from  pseudo-propellant  corresponding  the  finest  AP  fraction.  It  was  reported  in 
Ref.  [7]  that  SP  based  on  octogen  and  binder  CTPB  also  exhibit  weak  dependence  of  the  burning 
rate  on  the  ration  of  the  filler  fractions.

COMBUSTION  OF  METAL  IN  SOLID  PROPELLANTS 

Interest  to  metals  as  the  potential  components  of  rocket  propellants  arose  at  the  dawn  of  rocket 
era  due  to  the  great  heat  release  from  the  reaction  of  metal  oxidation,  which  exceeds  substantially 
that  of  the  reaction  of  usual  hydrocarbon  fuels.  This  provides  a  higher  temperature  of  combustion 
products  and  thus  a  higher  SP  efficiency  in  a  rocket  motor. 

According  to  the  pioneer  calculations  published  in  Russia  in  1929  [1]  boron  and  lithium  are  most 
preferable  with  respect  to  heat  release  upon  combustion  in  oxygen.  The  later  investigations  per¬ 
formed  in  the  area  of  chemical  thermodynamics  showed  [2]  that  more  heat  is  released  by  com¬ 
bustion  of  either  beryllium  in  oxygen  or  lithium  in  fluorine.  Note  that  the  oxygen,  interacting 
with  metals,  fails  to  give  the  maximum  heat  release.  Actually,  most  effective  oxidizers  are  fluo¬ 
rine  monoxide,  then  fluorine,  trifluorine  nitrogen,  ozone,  and  only  then  oxygen.  The  best  fuels  are 
lithium,  beryllium,  boron  as  well  as  aluminum  and  magnesium  (boron  belongs  to  metals  by  con¬ 
vention).  The  above  sequence  of  the  efficiency  of  fuels  corresponds  to  the  reaction  heat  per  1  g  of 
metal.  The  various  aspects  of  metal  combustion  in  rocket  propellants  have  been  considered  in  ex¬ 
cellent  reviews  [4,5],  paper  collections  [6,2]  and  textbooks  [7,8].  Below,  the  general  principles  of 
metallic  particle  combustion  and  the  problems  of  combustion  of  the  widely  used  metals:  alumi¬ 
num,  magnesium,  and  boron  are  reported.  Further  the  agglomeration  of  a  metal  and  its  transfor¬ 
mation  upon  combustion  are  also  discussed. 

5.1.  PHYSICAL  PRINCIPLES  OF  METAL  COMBUSTION 

Unlike  liquid  droplets  of  hydrocarbon  fuel,  the  combustion  of  metallic  particles  exhibits  a  great 
variety  of  mechanisms  because,  as  a  rule,  the  initial  metallic  particle  is  covered  with  oxide  layer. 
In  addition,  the  various  combinations  of  oxide  and  metal  characteristics,  e.g.,  the  temperatures  of 
melting,  boiling  and  solubility  determine  the  variety  of  combustion  mechanisms.  A  characteristic 
feature  of  the  series  of  metals  enclosed  in  the  class  of  metals  with  nonvolatile  oxide  (e.g.  alumi¬ 
num,  beryllium,  titanium,  zirconium)  is  the  oxide  refractory  nature.  For  these  metals  the  heat  of 
oxide  gasification  exceeds  the  chemical  energy  released  by  the  metal-oxygen  reaction  [8] 

AHyap-dissoc  >  Qr  —  (H° T,vol —  H° 298)  =  AHavail  (5.1) 

where  AHvap-dissoc  is  the  evaporation-dissociation  heat  of  metallic  oxide;  (H°t>Voi  -  H°29s)  is  the 
enthalpy  spent  to  heat  oxide  up  to  the  boiling  temperature;  Qr  is  the  heat  of  metal-oxygen  reac¬ 
tion  at  standard  temperature  298  K.  Equation  (4.1)  shows  that  when  the  reaction  products  are  in 
the  gaseous  state,  the  oxidation  is  endothermic  and  the  self-sustaining  (stationary)  combustion 
becomes  impossible.  It  is  also  seen  that  up  to  the  boiling  temperature  (dissociation  temperature) 
there  is  no  gaseous  metal  oxide  in  the  reacting  system. 

According  to  Eq.  (5.1)  the  maximum  flame  temperature  for  the  metals  with  a  refractory  oxide  is 
limited  to  the  boiling  temperature  of  oxide.  The  stationary  combustion  occurs  at  lower  tempera¬ 
ture  giving  rise  to  the  condensed  oxide,  which  is  necessary  for  the  process  to  occur.  The  combus¬ 
tion  of  metals  may  occur  either  in  the  vapor  phase  or  due  to  heterogeneous  oxidation.  Obviously, 


5—1 


for  the  vapor-phase  combustion  it  is  necessary  to  heat  the  metal  to  the  temperature  close  to  its 
boiling  temperature  that  is  high  for  many  metals.  According  to  Glassman's  criterion,  “for  a  metal 
to  bum  as  a  vapor,  the  oxide  volatilization  temperature  must  be  greater  than  the  temperature  of 
the  metal  boiling  point”[8].  Account  must  be  taken  of  the  fact  that  at  high  temperatures  oxide  de¬ 
composes  (partially  or  completely)  and  the  "boiling  point"  of  the  oxide  corresponds  to  the  tem¬ 
perature  at  which  the  condensed  oxide  is  in  equilibrium  with  the  ambient  gas  containing  the 
products  of  its  decomposition.  In  this  case,  the  "boiling  point"  is  sure  to  change  with  the  chemical 
composition  of  ambient  gas  but  may  be  readily  calculated  for  a  fixed  composition  and  pressure  of 
the  gas.  This  significant  refinement  of  the  concept  of  "boiling  point"  for  liquid  oxide  was  under¬ 
lined  in  [9],  criticizing  the  false  claim  [10]  that  the  vapor-liquid  oxide  equilibrium  can  be  calcu¬ 
lated  neglecting  chemical  transformations. 

The  up-to-date  classification  of  the  combustion  regimes  of  metals  is  presented  in  [5].  As  men¬ 
tioned  above,  the  main  distinctive  feature  used  in  the  classification  of  the  combustion  modes  of 
metals  is  the  oxide  (oxidation  product)  volatility.  The  second  property  is  the  volatility  of  the 
metal.  Finally,  the  third  feature  is  the  oxide  solubility  in  the  metal.  It  is  interesting  that  the  three 
metals  analyzed  are  referred  to  the  different  sections  of  a  given  classification.  Thus,  aluminum  is 
characterized  as  a  nonvolatile  metal  with  nonvolatile  and  insoluble  oxide  while  boron  is  charac¬ 
terized  as  the  "metal"  with  volatile  and  soluble  oxide. 

It  should  be  taken  into  account  that,  in  fact,  the  combustion  mechanism  may  depend  not  only  on 
the  physical  properties  but  also  on  the  geometrical  dimensions  of  metallic  particles.  It  has  been 
shown  [5]  that  the  combustion  behavior  differs  for  "small"  and  "large"  particles,  in  particular,  for 
volatile  metals.  In  this  case,  the  size  limit  is  about  50  pm.  It  is  assumed  that  the  small  particles 
are  less  prone  to  oxide  coating  formation  and  bum  mainly  in  the  vapor-phase  regime.  The  relative 
values  of  the  boiling  and  melting  points  of  metals  and  oxides  also  have  effect  on  the  combustion 
mechanism.  Remember  that  the  boiling  temperature  depends  on  pressure  and  gas  composition  of 
the  environment.  In  particular,  the  early  melting  of  metals  (most  known  metals)  may  lead  to  ei¬ 
ther  the  break  or  dissolving  of  oxide  skin  and  the  early  oxide  melting  (boron,  tungsten)  may  cause 
the  non-coating  of  particles  which  allows  oxygen  to  reach  the  metal. 

Metal  heating  and  oxidation  are  related  to  two  important  parameters,  characterizing  the  protective 
properties  of  the  oxide  skin.  The  first  parameter  is  the  relationship  between  the  coefficients  of 
thermal  expansion  of  solid  metal  and  oxide.  When  their  ratio  exceeds  unity,  the  oxide  skin  cracks 
upon  heating.  The  second  parameter  is  the  relationship  between  the  molar  volume  of  solid  oxide 
and  constituent  metal,  i.e.  the  oxide  skin  porosity.  This  relationship  is  calculated  by  the  formula 
below  (the  Pilling-Bedworth  coefficient): 

P  =  (pme/nA  me  )(Pox/Mox) 

In  this  case  pme  and  pox  are  the  metal  and  oxide  densities,  respectively,  n  is  the  number  of  metal 
atoms  in  the  oxide  molecule;  Ame  is  the  atomic  mass  of  the  metal;  Mox  is  the  molecular  mass  of 
the  oxide.  It  is  known  that  if  fkl,  the  oxide  skin  is  porous,  and  the  metal  interacts  with  oxygen 
even  at  a  relatively  low  temperature.  When  (3  »  1,  e.g.,  (3=3,  the  oxide  skin  is  subjected  to  sig¬ 
nificant  inner  stresses,  and  does  not  actually  prevent  metal  oxidation.  The  best  protecting  proper¬ 
ties  are  observed  for  oxide  skins  with  P=1.5  (e.g.,  for  aluminum  P=1.45).

A  peculiarity  of  the  combustion  of  metallic  particles  in  solid  propellants  lies  in  the  fact  that  the 
temperature  conditions  and  their  residence  time  in  the  combustion  wave  are  induced  independ¬ 
ently  due  to  the  combustion  of  other  propellant  components.  These  conditions  are  often  unfavor¬ 
able  for  metal  ignition  and  effective  combustion.  Indeed,  the  burning  surface  temperature  of  most 
solid  propellants  is  substantially  lower  than  the  melting  temperature  of  the  metals  used  which 
prevents  their  ignition  and  leads  to  the  accumulation  of  metal  on  the  burning  surface.  Under  these 
conditions  the  metallic  particles  on  the  burning  surface  merge  to  form  rather  large  "agglomerates" 
that  need  much  time  to  bum  out.  Actually,  the  combustion  of  metals  in  solid  propellants  only 
starts  either  on  or  near  the  burning  surface  and  ends  some  time  later  in  the  flow  of  combustion 
products  leading  to  the  effects  of  distributed  combustion. 

5.2.  COMBUSTION  OF  METALLIC  PARTICLES  UNDER  FIXED  CONDITIONS 

Laboratory  experiments  under  well-characterized  and  controlled  conditions  with  a  minimum 
number  of  variable  factors  are  of  great  importance  in  understanding  metallic  particle  combustion. 
These  experiments  involve  single  metallic  particles  heated  by  hot  gas,  laser  or  hot  plate.  Below 
we  give  the  experimental  and  theoretical  results  of  a  study  of  combustion  of  aluminum,  magne¬ 
sium,  and  boron  particles.  Most  attention  is  paid  to  aluminum  as  it  is  most  studied  and  is  widely 
used  in  solid  propellants.

Physical  properties 

As  has  been  mentioned  above,  A1  belongs  to  the  class  of  nonvolatile  metals  with  a  nonvolatile 
oxide.  The  physical  characteristics  of  A1  and  its  stoichiometric  oxide  are  listed  below  in  Table  1.

The  partial  pressure  of  A1  vapor  is  5.2  x  10'7  mm  Hg  for  T  =  Tmeit.(933K)  and  1  mm  Hg  at  2150 
K.  The  aluminum  oxide  has  two  crystal  modifications:  a(corundum)  with  a  rhombohedral  lattice 
and  y(alumina)  with  a  cubic  face-centered  lattice.  The  (X-AI2O3  density  is  3.96  g/cm3,  that  of  y- 
AI2O3  is  3.42  g/cm3.  The  oxide  porosity  (the  Pilling-Bedworth  criterion)  is  1.45  that  determines 
its  high  protective  properties.  Under  fast  heating  of  A1  to  770  K  the  amorphous  oxide  skin  is 
formed  on  its  surface  and  the  heating  to  higher  temperatures  gives  mixture  of  amorphous  oxide 
and  Y-AI2O3.

Peculiarities  of  the  combustion  mechanism 

In  [13-16]  the  combustion  of  individual  aluminum  particles  has  been  studied  at  atmospheric  pres¬ 
sure  in  the  flow  of  hot  oxidative  gas  with  variable  composition  created  either  using  a  gas  burner 
or  by  combustion  of  a  metal-free  propellant  charge.  The  luminosity  and  image  of  burning  parti¬ 
cles  were  recorded.  The  analysis  of  high  speed  movie  data  shows  that  after  a  corresponding 
heating  the  100-200  pm  particles  are  ignited  during  0.2-0.3  ms.  At  this  instant  the  intensity  of 
particle  luminosity  increases  sharply  but  the  diameter  of  the  luminous  zone  exceeds  negligibly 
that  of  the  particle.  Further,  during  1  ms  the  width  of  the  luminous  zone  increases  either  to  2.5- 
3.5  particle  diameters  if  combustion  occurs  in  the  "dry"  medium  containing  no  water  vapor  or  to 
1.5-2  diameters  in  the  case  of  combustion  in  the  "wet"  medium.  When  the  particle  falls  behind 
the  gas  flow,  the  luminous  tail  forms  which  indicates  a  tentative  occurrence  of  exothermic  reac¬ 
tions.  After  ignition,  the  A1  particles  begin  to  rotate  with  a  frequency  of  103  -  104  Hz,  which  is 
followed  by  distortions  in  their  trajectories.  This  can  be  caused  by  nonuniform  distribution  of 
oxide  over  the  metal  droplet  and  by  the  side  pulse  of  the  reactive  force  arising  from  nonuniform 
metal  evaporation. 

In  the  final  stage,  the  burning  A1  particle  splits  up  often  into  several  small  particles,  scattering  at 
different  angles  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  the  initial  particle  motion.  It  is  reported  [13]  that 
the  fragmentation  of  the  burning  A1  droplets  in  the  propane-oxygen-hydrogen  flame  is  observed 
only  in  the  case  where  the  concentration  of  oxygen  exceeds  28-38%  (the  lower  is  the  flame  tem¬ 
perature,  the  higher  is  the  necessary  oxygen  concentration).  A  similar  limit  to  oxygen  content 
(32%)  has  been  determined  for  the  flame  hydrocarbon-oxygen-nitrogen  [14].  It  is  assumed  then 
that  the  fragmentation  of  A1  particles  in  the  flame  depends  on  the  overheating  of  liquid  metal  and 
on  intense  vapor  release. 

The  combustion  of  A1  particles  in  the  high-temperature  flame  gives  rise  to  the  hollow  transparent 
oxide  particles.  These  hollow  particles  are  often  bound  to  the  surface  of  burning  A1  particles.  The 
existence  of  either  hydrogen  or  water  vapor  in  the  flame  stimulates  the  formation  of  hollow 
spheres.  The  phase  composition  of  the  oxide,  forming  upon  A1  combustion  in  oxygen,  depends  on 
the  conditions  of  its  formation  [2].  The  main  fraction  under  usual  combustion  conditions  is  com¬ 
posed  of  CX-AI2O3  (corundum).  This  oxide  modification  is  most  stable.  Combustion  either  in 
subatmospheric  pressure  conditions  or  upon  sharp  cooling  the  products  results  in  the  formation  of 
Y-AI2O3,  which  under  heating  above  1000  K  transforms  into  OC-AI2O3. 

Interesting  results  have  been  obtained  [17]  for  the  combustion  of  A1  particles  in  the  medium  with 
varying  partial  oxygen  pressure  from  0.2  to  1.5  atm.  In  this  case,  the  method  of  laser  heating,  de¬ 
scribed  in  [18],  was  used.  The  pulse  of  ruby  laser  radiation  ignited  a  particle  with  a  diameter  of 
about  50  pm,  fastened  initially  (without  glue,  only  electrostatically)  to  a  silicon  thread  of  10  pm 
in  diameter.  A  reflecting  mirror  was  used  to  irradiate  particles  uniformly.  The  ignition  and  com¬ 
bustion  of  a  freely  falling  A1  particle  was  recorded  with  a  high-speed  camera  at  a  frequency  of 
about  5000  frames/s. 

At  a  given  partial  oxygen  pressure,  two  ignition  regimes  have  been  established.  For  the  low  en¬ 
ergy  laser  pulse  values,  the  ignition  proceeds  slowly  and  the  flame  radius  increases  gradually. 
The  condensed  oxide  is  kept  on  the  particle  upon  combustion  and  the  flame  is  nonspherical  in 
shape.  When  the  energy  exceeds  the  threshold  value,  the  ignition  is  rapid,  the  oxide  is  not  accu- 


5 — 4 


mulated  on  the  particle,  and  the  flame  is  spherical  in  shape.  Thus,  combustion  is  experimentally 
shown  to  follow  different  mechanisms  depending  on  initial  conditions. 

The  qualitative  explanation  of  the  results  [17]  is  given  additionally  in  [5].  For  simplicity,  it  is  as¬ 
sumed  that  all  combustion  products  are  in  the  condensed  phase.  In  this  case,  in  the  quasistation¬ 
ary  combustion  regime  the  net  velocity  of  ambient  gas,  determined  by  oxygen  diffusion,  must  be 
directed  towards  the  metal  particle  and  the  oxide  particles  in  the  regime  of  intense  combustion 
(without  accumulation  of  oxide  on  the  metal)  must  move  outward.  The  motion  of  the  oxide  parti¬ 
cle  outward  is  provided  by  a  thermophoretic  force.  In  the  case  of  low  ignition  energies,  the  sur¬ 
face  of  metallic  particles  does  not  initially  become  freed  of  oxide  skin  and  the  thermophoretic 
mechanism  of  oxide  particle  motion  becomes  unstable  due  to  non-sphericity  which  is  sure  to  lead 
to  the  irregular  and  non  spherical  combustion  of  the  A1  droplet. 

This  simplified  mechanism  may  be  more  pronounced  for  the  case  of  A1  combustion  in  the  oxy¬ 
gen-rich  medium.  In  pure  oxygen  the  diffusion  control  regime  of  metal  combustion  is  impossible. 
Indeed,  a  fast  burning  of  the  A1  droplet  with  almost  spherical  wrinkled  flame  surface  which  peri¬ 
odically  emits  fine  oxide,  has  been  experimentally  observed  when  combusting  in  oxygen  [17]. 
Unfortunately,  as  shown  in  [5],  the  questions  of  experimental  data  interpretation  find  no  answer. 
How  is  the  burning  rate  of  metals  controlled?  The  chemical  kinetics  with  the  finite  velocities  of 
heterogeneous  transformations  gives  rather  overestimated  burning  rates.  What  is  the  contribution 
of  oxygen  diffusion  through  the  condensed  oxide?  Does  the  spherical  flame  image  observed  in 
[17]  represent  the  liquid  oxide  skin? 

The  data  of  high  speed  movie  of  liquid  A1  droplet  combustion  [17]  show  that  within  the  meas¬ 
urement  accuracy  the  law  of  droplet  diameter  change  with  time  may  be  described  by  either  d2  = 
do2  -  kt  or  d  =  do  -  kt .  Treating  a  great  body  of  data,  we  see  that  for  small  particles  (smaller  than 
10  pm),  more  suitable  is  the  linear  law  and  for  the  relatively  large  particles,  preferable  is  the 
square  (d2)  law.  It  is  concluded  then  [5]  that  for  aluminum  and  most  other  metals  the  combustion 
of  small  particles  follows  the  kinetic  mechanism  and  that  of  large  particles  follows  the  diffusion 
control  mechanism. 

The  method  of  laser  heating  of  metal  particles  was  used  in  a  number  of  papers  to  study  the  details 
of  combustion  mechanism.  The  A1  particles  with  diameter  230-680  pm,  attached  to  the  tip  of  a 
thin  quartz  thread,  were  ignited  using  a  CC>2-laser  in  the  air  and  in  C02  and  O2  (P=l  atm)[19].  It 
has  been  established  that  the  heating  in  the  air  by  a  low  radiant  flux  (the  melting  of  particle  400 
pm  in  diameter  for  0.5  s)  gives  first  micro  fractures  and  then  causes  the  melting  of  the  A1  particle 
which  then  becomes  mirror-shiny.  Its  diameter  was  observed  [17]  to  increase  by  5%.  A  subse¬ 
quent  weak  heating  for  10-15  s  fails  to  cause  any  changes  in  the  appearance  and  size  of  the  liquid 
A1  droplet.  An  increase  in  the  laser  heating  intensity  leads  to  changes  in  the  qualitative  picture  of 
the  process.  After  particle  melting  and  the  formation  of  a  bright  droplet,  a  luminous  aureole  50 
pm  wide  appears  after  an  interval  of  20%  of  the  heating  time.  Then,  after  a  delay  equal  to  double 
the  time  of  heating  to  melting,  the  flame  appears  at  the  local  point  near  the  surface  of  the  particle, 
which  propagates  further  over  the  surface  with  a  velocity  of  about  800  mm/s. 

In  the  combustion  regime  with  a  developed  flame,  small  spherical  particles  of  20-80  pm  move 
from  the  surface  of  a  "parent"  particle.  In  this  case,  the  smallest  particles  leave  the  flame  zone 


5—5 


and  the  larger  ones  return  after  a  time  to  the  particle  surface.  The  luminescence  of  the  hot  A1 
droplet  is  inhomogeneous.  The  luminous  regions,  covering  30%  of  the  total  area,  are  observed  to 
form  on  the  droplet  surface.  These  luminescent  spots  correspond  to  oxide  "caps".  The  ignition 
time  of  A1  particle  (400  pm)  in  the  air  under  these  conditions  was  270  ms,  that  of  the  particles  of 
230  pm  was  100  ms.  When  CO2  was  used  instead  of  air,  the  ignition  time  (flame  appearance)  in¬ 
creased  by  10-15%.  Ignition  in  pure  oxygen  is  much  faster  (a  400  pm  particle  is  ignited  in  110 
ms)  and  transition  to  combustion  is  realized  during  a  very  short  period  and  cannot  be  studied  in 
detail  with  a  framing  rate  of  5000  frame/s. 

The  data,  supplementary  to  the  results  [19]  for  the  condensed  products  of  A1  particle  combustion 
in  air,  are  given  in  [20].  The  A1  particles  250-900  pm  in  diameter,  fastened  with  an  ethanol  drop¬ 
let  to  the  tip  of  the  quartz  needle,  were  ignited  by  a  CC>2-laser  and  allowed  to  fall  on  a  thin  glass 
plate.  Finally,  the  "parent"  particle  and  a  set  of  small  oxide  particles  precipitated  on  the  plate.  A 
microscope  analysis  of  this  precipitate  shows  that  the  smoke  particles  of  1  pm  are  uniformly  dis¬ 
tributed  in  concentric  zones  around  the  parent  particles.  In  this  case,  the  concentration  maximum 
is  localized  at  a  distance  of  2.5-3  diameters  from  its  surface  (initial  particles  being  900  pm  in  di¬ 
ameter).  The  oxide  particles  with  a  mean  diameter  of  10-100  pm  have  been  recorded  along  with 
the  smoke  particles.  The  larger  the  initial  A1  particle,  the  larger  is  the  oxide  particle.  The  esti¬ 
mated  calculation  of  the  total  volume  of  precipitated  particles  shows  that  the  "mean"  oxide  parti¬ 
cles  must  be  hollow. 

An  original  method  to  investigate  the  ignition  and  combustion  of  individual  metallic  particles  has 
been  developed  in  [21].  The  pre-charged  A1  particles  with  diameter  35-70  pm  were  supplied 
through  the  hole  in  the  upper  electrode  to  a  special  electrodynamic  levitator,  holding  a  particle  at 
the  center  of  the  gas  cavity  between  electrodes.  Ignition  was  realized  using  a  CO2  laser.  The 
burning  particle  was  photographed  at  a  rate  of  25-1000  frame/s  and  recorded  using  photomulti¬ 
plier  tubes  of  flame  radiation  at  wavelengths  of  488  nm  and  514.5  nm,  corresponding  to  strong 
lines  in  the  radiation  range  of  AlO.  Experiments  were  carried  out  in  air  at  1-40  atm.  It  has  been 
established  that  the  delay  in  ignition  of  a  40  pm  A1  particle  is  2.5  ms  under  laser  radiation  of  a 
given  intensity  (a  focused  CC>2-laser,  20  W)  at  1  atm  and  increases  to  5  ms  at  40  atm.  The  total 
time  of  ignition  measured  by  the  flame  radiation  signal  decreases  by  about  30%  with  rising  pres¬ 
sure  from  1  to  20  atm  when  combustion  occurs  without  laser  radiation  at  the  instant  of  ignition 
and  by  about  100%  when  combustion  occurs  under  constant  radiation.  With  further  pressure  rise 
to  40  atm  the  combustion  time  remains  almost  constant.  The  dependence  of  combustion  time  on 
diameter  for  the  self-sustaining  combustion  of  the  A1  particle  (the  laser  being  switched  off  at  the 
instant  of  ignition)  is  square,  t~d2  over  the  entire  pressure  range  of  1-40  atm. 

Qualitatively,  a  sequence  of  events  in  the  ignition  and  combustion  of  the  A1  particle  is  described 
as  follows.  The  formation  of  flame  upon  ignition  takes  less  than  1  ms.  In  this  case,  it  covers  the 
entire  surface  of  the  particle.  The  luminous  flame  zone  extends  gradually  and  is  held  at  a  distance 
of  2-3  radii  of  the  particle  from  its  surface  at  1  atm  and  of  3-4  radii  at  20  atm.  The  luminosity  in¬ 
tensity  at  20-40  atm  is  maximal  at  the  beginning  of  combustion.  Then  it  remains  at  a  mean  level 
with  variations  for  50-60%  of  combustion  time  and  decreases  about  3-fold  compared  to  the  mean 
level  at  the  final  stage  amounting  to  about  30%  of  the  total  time  of  luminescence.  At  1-20  atm  the 
luminosity  intensity  decreases  monotonically  with  time.  A  decrease  in  luminescence  level  in  the 
final  stage  of  combustion  is  accompanied  by  a  decrease  in  the  size  of  the  luminous  zone  and  by  a 


5—6 


spread  of  the  dark  zone  over  the  surface  which  gradually  covers  the  entire  particle.  It  is  assumed 
then  that  the  dark  zone  is  a  cooling  oxide  skin,  which  prevents  oxide  diffusion  to  the  metallic 
particle.  The  size  of  the  extinct  particle,  determined  from  the  cadres  of  speed  shooting,  is  close  to 
the  initial  size  before  ignition.  The  chemical  composition  and  the  material  density  of  the  extinct 
particle  are,  however,  unknown. 

Note  that  the  qualitative  observations  of  [21]  correlate  well  with  the  results  obtained  in  [22,23] 
concerning  the  stages  of  A1  particle  combustion  (luminescence).  At  the  same  time,  in  [22,23] 
available  is  an  important  quantitative  information  about  the  parameters  of  A1  particle  combustion. 
Experiments  were  carried  out  in  air  using  85-150  pm  particles,  produced  by  means  of  a  pulsed 
micro-arc  discharge  by  melting  a  wire  aluminum  electrode.  In  experiments  with  freely  falling 
burning  A1  particles  the  color  temperature  of  a  metallic  droplet  was  measured  by  recording  radia¬ 
tion  at  wave  lengths  of  520,  580,  and  458  nm,  which  did  not  coincide  with  the  bands  in  the  oxide 
emission  spectrum.  In  addition,  the  luminous  flame  has  been  shot  with  0.5  ms  exposure  time  and 
the  particles  extinguished  on  the  glass  and  metallic  plates  have  been  studied. 

A  comparison  with  the  data  obtained  in  experiments  on  laser  flux  ignition  [17,18,21]  shows  that  a 
general  character  and  the  time  of  A1  particles  burning  in  air  remain  almost  unchanged  despite  the 
difference  between  the  methods  of  ignition.  The  visualization  and  measurements  of  radiation  in¬ 
tensity  [23]  testify  to  the  existence  of  three  stages  of  A1  particle  combustion.  In  the  first  stage,  the 
signal  of  particle  (not  of  flame)  radiation  is  smooth  and  average  in  amplitude.  The  measured 
metal  temperature  amounts  to  2600-2700°C  with  variations  of  50°C,  which  exceeds  the  boiling 
temperature  of  pure  metal.  In  the  second  stage,  the  radiation  intensity  increases  noticeably  and 
becomes  oscillating.  The  mean  temperature  drops  by  200°C  with  100°C  variations.  Finally,  in  the 
third  stage,  the  radiation  intensity  reaches  a  comparatively  low  level  (noticeably  lower  than  the 
initial  level)  and  is  also  of  an  oscillating  nature.  The  temperature  decreases  gradually  from 
2400°C  to  2000°C  with  150°C  variations,  followed  by  extinction.  Excellent  agreement  observed 
between  the  color  temperatures  determined  using  two  different  ratios  of  the  radiation  intensities 
(580/520  nm  and  580/458  nm)  allows  the  conclusion  [23]  that  the  particle  and  flame  temperatures 
differ  but  weakly.  The  duration  of  the  first  period  with  decreasing  diameter  of  initial  particles 
from  180  pm  to  80  pm  increases  from  25  to  35%  of  the  total  combustion  time  and  that  of  the 
third  period  decreases  from  60  to  55%. 

Extinction  by  impact  on  a  cold  A1  plate  in  various  combustion  stages  allows  to  measure  the  time 
dependence  of  the  burning  particle  diameter.  This  dependence  appeared  to  be  diameter  square  fit, 
t-d2.  As  mentioned  in  [23],  the  conventional  methods  of  extinction  by  "freezing"  in  inert  gas  fail 
to  provide  the  necessary  accuracy  because  such  a  comparatively  slow  process  gives  rise  to  voids 
in  the  metallic  particle  which  is  not  observed  upon  extinction  on  a  metallic  plate.  The  usual  mi¬ 
croscopic  investigation  of  the  extinguished  particles  as  well  as  the  pictures  made  using  a  scanning 
electron  microscope  show  that  in  the  first  two  stages  the  surface  remains  clean.  Only  in  the  third 
stage  the  oxide  "caps"  are  formed  whose  volume  increases  with  time  amounting  to  more  than 
50%  of  the  particle  volume  by  the  end  of  its  combustion. 

The  examination  of  the  extinguished  metallic  particles  with  electron  probe  microanalyzer 
“Cameca  SX50”  testifies  that  in  the  first  stage  the  local  atomic  content  of  oxygen  in  the  extin¬ 
guished  particle  does  not  exceed  4%  which  corresponds  to  the  oxygen  concentration  in  the  parent 


5—7 


A1  wire.  In  the  second  stage  the  local  oxygen  concentration  varies  from  4  to  14%  and  in  the  third 
stage  it  reaches  55%  if  the  electron  beam  falls  directly  on  the  oxide  "cap".  The  latter  is  in  fair 
agreement  with  the  theoretical  content  of  oxygen  in  AI2O3. 

A  detailed  X-ray  analysis  of  the  cross-sections  of  the  extinguished  particles  was  undertaken  in 
order  to  check  the  presence  of  atoms  other  than  A1  and  O  in  the  particle  interior.  Search  for  nitro¬ 
gen  indicated  that  the  nitrogen  atoms  are  recorded  only  in  the  third  stage  and  only  in  the  oxide 
"cap".  At  the  same  time,  a  small  impurity  of  iron  (less  than  0.5%  atomic),  typical  of  the  initial 
material  of  the  A1  wire,  is  recorded  in  the  metallic  part  of  the  extinguished  particle  and  does  not 
exist  in  the  oxide  "cap".  These  data  indicate  that  the  oxide  "cap"  is  formed  by  the  material  depo¬ 
sition  from  the  flame  zone  rather  than  due  to  the  phase  transformation  of  the  initial  metal  on  the 
particle  surface. 

The  mean  local  oxygen  concentration  in  the  surface  layer  may  be  explained  by  analyzing  the  dia¬ 
gram  of  the  phase  equilibrium  in  the  Al-0  system.  The  diagram  shows  that  14%  correspond  to 
the  maximum  content  of  oxygen  in  liquid  A1  upon  nonstationary  dissolving  of  suboxides.  In  this 
case,  the  boiling  temperature  for  the  system  liquid  Al-0  solution,  liquid  AI2O3,  and  gaseous  ox¬ 
ides  is  lower  by  220°C  than  that  of  liquid  pure  metal.  It  is  assumed  that  the  transition  from  the 
first  stage  to  the  second  stage  occurs  due  to  the  saturation  of  the  metal  surface  layer  by  dissolved 
suboxides  AlO  and  A120  which  may  give  rise  to  liquid  oxide  on  the  surface  of  a  burning  particle. 
Its  gradual  accumulation  results  in  transition  to  the  third  stage,  characterized  by  the  asymmetric 
growth  of  the  oxide  "cap". 

Additional  experiments  with  use  of  a.c.  and  d.c.  electric  fields  [23]  show  that  the  burning  A1  par¬ 
ticles  are  charged  positively  and  a  165  pm  particle  bums  in  the  field  with  a  frequency  of  10  kHz 
and  strength  of  2000  V/cm  by  15-20%  faster  than  without  the  a.c.  field.  It  is  supposed  then  that 
the  eigen  electric  field  of  the  burning  A1  particle  may  have  effect  on  the  processes  occurring  in 
the  flame  zone  and  on  the  process  of  oxide  "cap"  formation. 

New  information  about  the  temperature  field  and  the  concentration  distribution  upon  combustion 
of  a  freely  falling  A1  particle  was  derived  using  advanced  spectroscopic  technique  combined  with 
electron  probe  microanalysis  of  condensed  combustion  products  [24].  Experiments  were  per¬ 
formed  in  the  quiescent  air;  the  particle  size  was  210  pm;  ignition  was  realized  using  either  Ar- 
or  CC>2-lasers.  Recording  of  the  total  burning  particle  radiation  using  photodiode  shows  a  three- 
stage  pattern  of  luminescence  (see  Fig.  5  1),  as  described  earlier  in  [21,23],  A  changeover  from 
the  "smooth"  to  "intermittent"  luminosity  regime  with  the  rotation  and  fragmentation  of  the 
burning  particle  has  been  explained  with  respect  to  the  course  of  the  chemical  reaction  in  the  par¬ 
ticle  and  the  formation  of  voids  filled  with  gaseous  A1  suboxides. 

To  provide  the  maximum  objectivity  of  interpretation  of  the  spectroscopic  data,  the  PLIF  images 
of  A1  were  recorded  in  the  initial  combustion  phase  in  the  presence  of  a  symmetric  flame  around 
the  burning  particle.  When  publishing  the  first  option  of  experimental  results  in  [24],  it  was  un¬ 
derlined  that  in  order  to  eliminate  the  data  statistical  uncertainty  one  should  use  improved  ex¬ 
perimental  technique  and  advanced  mathematical  treatment.  A  Revised  Version  of  the  data  on 
AlO  profile  and  temperature  distribution  around  burning  A1  particle  is  presented  in  Fig.  5.2.  The 
radial  distribution  of  both  the  AlO  concentration  and  vibrational  temperature  were  calculated  us- 


5—8 


ing  the  complex  treatment  of  the  induced  fluorescence  signal.  It  has  been  established  that  the 
maximum  AlO  concentration  is  reached  at  a  distance  about  2  radii  from  the  particle  center  and 
the  maximum  flame  temperature,  equal  approximately  to  3300K,  is  reached  at  a  distance  of  5  ra¬ 
dii.  The  AlO  temperature  near  the  particle  surface  is  equal  to  2250°C,  i.e.,  it  is  substantially  lower 
than  that  of  A1  boiling.  A  micro-X-ray  analysis  of  the  condensed  combustion  residuals,  collected 
in  the  process  of  impacting  the  burning  particles  on  silicon  wafers,  shows  that  the  maximum  con¬ 
centration  of  small  AI2O3  particles  is  at  a  distance  of  3.5  radii  from  the  particle  center  (Fig.  5  2).

Analyzing  the  results  of  the  above  papers,  one  may  formulate  a  general  picture  of  the  combustion 
of  a  single  A1  particle  in  the  oxygen-containing  medium.  Heating  the  particle  by  external  heat 
flux  results  in  metal  melting,  followed  by  an  increase  in  the  volume  and  by  the  cracking  of  the 
oxide  skin.  In  the  case  of  slow  heating  (about  0.1-10  K/s)  the  cracks  in  the  oxide  skin  are  healed 
and  no  ignition  is  observed.  Under  rather  fast  heating  the  particles  are  freed  from  the  initial  oxide 
skin  and  the  metal  vapors,  reacting  with  oxygen  near  the  particle,  are  ignited.  Initially,  combus¬ 
tion  follows  the  mechanism  similar  to  the  classical  mechanism  of  the  evaporating  hydrocarbon 
droplet.  The  peculiarities  of  the  combustion  mechanism  of  metallic  combustibles  are  determined 
by  the  behavior  of  oxidation  products.  The  combustion  intermediate,  AlO  suboxide,  is  definitely 
recorded  in  the  gas  phase,  and  is  likely  to  play  the  key  role  in  the  reaction  mechanism  [24].  In  the 
regime  of  the  developed  symmetric  flame  (initial  combustion  stage)  AlO  diffuses  towards  the 


5—9 


metallic  particle  and  reacts  with  liquid  Al.  Nonzero  A1  concentration  near  the  metal  surface  [24] 
indicates  that  the  rate  of  this  reaction  is  limited  by  chemical  kinetics  rather  than  by  diffusion.  The 
temperature  of  metal  surface  in  the  self-sustaining  combustion  is  determined  by  the  data  of  dif¬ 
ferent  authors  in  the  range  of  2100-2400°C,  i.e.  below  the  boiling  temperature  of  pure  aluminum. 
This  is  the  only  indication  of  overheating  of  the  metal  surface  [23]  that  can  be  attributed  to  the 
unsteadiness  of  the  process  and  should  be  checked  again  in  future  experiments.  The  surface  tem¬ 
perature  at  the  instant  of  ignition  is  below  the  melting  temperature  of  oxide  (2040°C). 


Fig.  5.2.  AlO  profile  and  temperature  distribution  around  a  burning  Al  particle. 


The  above  pattern  of  Al  combustion  in  oxygen  coincides  mainly  with  that  obtained  by  the  results 
of  a  study  of  Al  combustion  in  pure  C02  [25].  It  has  been  established  that  the  ignition  of  pre¬ 
heated  cylindrical  Al  samples  (m  =2.1  g)  in  the  counter  flow  C02  stream  at  a  relatively  low  Al 
temperature  causes  a  slow  oxidation  of  the  sample  from  the  surface.  When  heated  above  critical 
temperature,  the  Al  sample  is  ignited  and  bums  giving  a  bright  green-white  flame.  The  critical 
ignition  temperature  is  lower  than  the  melting  temperature  of  A12C>3.  Spectroscopic  measurements 
show  that  the  considerable  concentrations  of  Al  and  AlO  vapors  are  observed  above  the  burning 
metal  surface.  In  this  case,  the  peak  of  AlO  concentration  is  at  a  finite  distance  from  the  surface. 
It  is  assumed  that  AlO  diffuses  to  the  sample  surface.  At  the  same  time,  according  to  the  data  of 
shooting,  0.85  s  after  the  beginning  of  combustion  the  metal  surface  remains  clean  and  contains 
no  traces  of  stoichiometric  oxide,  Al203. 

Combustion  of  Al  particles  in  solid  propellant 

The  thermodynamic  calculations  show  that  the  combustion  products  of  the  typical  ammonium 
perchlorate-based  solid  propellants  contain  H20,  C02,  and  CO  as  the  main  oxidizer  agents.  The 
amounts  of  other  oxidizers  (OH,  02,  O,  etc)  are  negligible.  Thus,  the  results  of  investigations  of 


5—10 


A1  combustion  in  oxygen-containing  mixtures  cannot  be  directly  referred  to  A1  combustion  in  the 
products  of  solid  propellant  decomposition,  in  particular,  in  a  quantitative  respect.  According  to 
[2],  the  combustion  time  in  the  flame  of  solid  propellants  of  spherical  A1  particles  at  1  atm  is  pro¬ 
portional  to  d2  and  at  pressures  above  30  atm  it  is  proportional  to  d1'5.  It  is  known,  that  the  burn¬ 
ing  time  is  approximately  in  reverse  proportion  to  the  total  concentration  of  oxidizers  in  the  flame 
and  the  flame  temperature  and  medium  pressure  practically  have  no  effect  on  bum  out  time. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  combustion  of  the  individual  (virgin)  particles  is  not  typical  of  the 
flames  of  metallized  solid  propellants.  Actually,  in  the  combustion  wave  of  such  propellants  we 
observe  the  coalescence  of  the  initial  small  size  (5-30  pm)  aluminum  particles,  and  comparatively 
large  agglomerates  (50-300  pm)  eject  from  the  surface.  The  question  of  metal  agglomeration  will 
be  discussed  later.  Now  we  would  like  to  mention  that  it  is  not  reasonable  to  simulate  experi¬ 
mentally  the  ignition  and  combustion  of  agglomerates  by  inserting  equivalent  large  metallic  par¬ 
ticles  to  the  propellant.  Experiment  shows  that  the  large  individual  A1  particles  (100-200  pm) 
cannot  be  ignited  at  least  at  low  pressures  on  the  reacting  surface  of  solid  propellants  and  they 
bum  out  at  greater  distances  from  the  burning  surface  than  agglomerates  [2]. 

However,  the  data  on  the  burning  times  of  individual  A1  particles  of  small  sizes  in  gas  flames 
whose  composition  imitates  that  of  the  combustion  products  of  solid  propellants  are  of  specific 
interest  for  treating  real  combustion  processes.  In  [26]  the  spherical  A1  particles  of  diameter  40- 
80  pm  were  burnt  out  in  the  combustor  of  the  diffusion  flame  with  a  separate  supply  of  CO2, 
H2O,  and  O2.  The  calculated  composition  of  combustion  products  was  varied  within  the  range 
(H2:C>2)  ->  (0.89:0.11)  and  (C02:H20:C>2)  (0.18:0.66:0.16).  The  burning  time  was  calculated 

by  treating  the  photomultiplier  signal  measuring  the  luminescence  intensity  of  the  reacting  parti¬ 
cle.  It  has  been  established  that  the  method  of  treatment  introduces  substantial  errors  due  to 
measurements  because  extinction  occurs  gradually  and  the  luminescence  signal  decay  has  as¬ 
ymptotic  nature.  The  method  of  treatment  by  a  given  minimum  level  of  luminosity,  assumed  as 
the  end  of  combustion,  was  used  as  most  reliable.  The  dependence  of  burning  time  on  particle 
size  was  in  agreement  with  the  square  law.  Under  this  condition  (t~d2),  the  dependence  of  burn¬ 
ing  time  on  the  concentration  of  the  effective  oxidizer  is  exponential  with  an  exponent  of  -0.85. 
In  this  case  the  effective  oxidizer  is  the  sum  of  molecular  concentrations  of  O2,  H2O,  and  CO2 
with  the  corresponding  weights  1, 0.533,  and  0.135,  determined  earlier  by  the  mathematical  mod¬ 
eling  of  A1  combustion  [27]. 

Mathematical  modeling  of  A1  particle  combustion. 

The  models  of  A1  combustion  are  qualitatively  similar  to  the  classical  combustion  model  of  the 
evaporating  droplet  but  display  substantial  peculiarities  due  to  consideration  of  the  condensation 
of  oxide  and  its  interaction  with  the  initial  metal.  There  are  not  less  than  ten  variants  of  the  model 
differing  in  both  the  consideration  of  various  factors  and  the  methods  of  solution  (see,  e.g.  [27- 
34]).  A  brief  analysis  of  the  models  is  given  in  [27]  suggesting  the  improved  variant  of  the  Law 
model  [29].  Improvements  concern  a  reasonable  extension  of  the  chemical  mechanism  of  A1  re¬ 
acting  and  a  more  detailed  consideration  of  gasdynamic  factors  and  the  process  of  oxide  accu¬ 
mulation  on  the  burning  metal  surface. 

The  problem  of  combustion  under  steady-state  conditions  is  formulated  separately  for  the  internal 
(between  metal  surface  and  flame)  and  external  (from  flame  surface  to  infinity)  zones.  Figure  5.3 


5—11 


shows  a  simplified  sketch  of  the  proposed  mechanism  for  A1  particle  combustion.  It  is  assumed 
that  upon  combustion  the  condensed  oxide  precipitates  first  on  the  surface  of  a  pure  spherical 
metallic  particle  as  a  hemisphere,  preventing  metal  from  evaporation  from  this  part  of  particle 
surface.  The  calculated  amount  of  precipitated  oxide  after  metal  burnout  corresponds  to  oxide 
particle  with  diameter  about  65%  of  that  of  the  initial  metallic  particle. 


Fig.  5.3.  Schematic  of  a  simplified  combustion  model  for  aluminum. 


Four  potential  combustion  modes  are  postulated  depending  on  the  ambient  temperature  and  com¬ 
position.  At  low  gas  temperature  or  oxidizer  concentration  the  ambient  gas  moves  towards  flame 
surface  whose  temperature  is  lower  than  the  boiling  temperature  of  oxide.  In  this  case,  the  frac¬ 
tion  of  evaporating  oxide  is  zero.  As  the  ambient  temperature  and  oxidizer  concentration  in¬ 
crease,  the  flame  temperature  reaches  the  boiling  temperature  of  oxide.  In  this  case  the  fraction  of 
evaporating  oxide  becomes  nonzero  and  increases  gradually  and  the  direction  of  ambient  gas  is 
reversed  due  to  an  increase  of  the  diffusion  flow  of  the  evaporated  oxide.  The  direction  of  the  to¬ 
tal  gas  flow  away  from  the  flame  is  preserved  with  further  rise  in  both  ambient  temperature  and 
oxidizer  concentration  when  it  is  assumed  that  100%  of  the  forming  oxide  evaporate  and  the 
flame  temperature  becomes  higher  than  that  of  oxide  boiling. 

Note  that  the  available  experimental  data  have  been  obtained  within  comparatively  narrow  limits 
of  the  variations  in  medium  parameters  and  it  is  impossible  to  verify  the  existence  of  all  postu¬ 
lated  combustion  modes.  The  calculations  by  model  [27]  show  that  the  burning  depends  substan- 


5—12 


tially  on  the  oxide  type.  Therefore,  calculating  the  effective  oxidizer  concentration  in  the  flame  it 
is  necessary  to  sum  up  the  mole  fractions  of  reagents  with  a  corresponding  weight  factor  as  has 
been  already  mentioned  in  the  analysis  of  experimental  data  [26]  (among  the  typical  oxidizers  in 
the  solid  propellant  flame  most  effective  is  oxygen  and  then  water  vapor  and,  at  last,  CO2).  At  the 
same  time,  the  size  of  the  flame  zone  is  unusually  dependent  on  the  type  and  concentration  of 
components.  As  the  oxygen  concentration  increases,  the  flame  stand  off  distance  increases  from 
1.5  to  2.5  radii  from  the  A1  particle  center.  However,  as  the  concentration  of  water  vapor  in¬ 
creases,  this  distance  decreases  from  2.5  to  2.0  radii  and  remains  almost  the  same  and  equal  to  2.2 
radii  with  variations  in  CO2  concentration. 

In  the  initial  variant  of  the  model  the  temperature  on  the  burning  A1  surface  was  taken  to  equal 
the  boiling  temperature  of  pure  metal.  It  is  worthwhile  to  consider  further  the  boiling  which  oc¬ 
curs  simultaneously  with  the  dissociative  reaction  between  liquid  oxide  and  Al,  resulting  in  gase¬ 
ous  Al,  AI2O,  and  AlO.  The  influence  of  pressure  in  the  model  is  taken  into  account  only  due  to  a 
change  in  the  thermophysical  parameters  of  medium  and  boiling  on  particle  surface.  The  calcu¬ 
lated  increase  in  particle  burning  velocity  is  only  20%  with  pressure  rise  from  1  to  70  atm.  This  is 
substantially  higher  than  the  experimental  [14]  and  calls  for  model  improvement.  The  blocking  of 
a  part  of  evaporating  particle  surface  by  condensed  oxide  causes  a  decrease  in  burning  velocity 
by  about  25%,  neglecting  additional  heat  release  due  to  oxide  condensation.  Obviously,  taking 
into  account  this  heat  in  the  case  where  Al  suboxides  react  on  the  metal  surface  with  each  other 
and  with  the  metal  may  change  considerably  the  heat  balance  and  affect  the  calculated  results. 
This  points,  however,  to  the  necessity  of  obtaining  quantitative  information  about  heterogeneous 
reactions  of  Al,  its  suboxides  and  oxide.  Nevertheless,  as  a  whole,  the  model  [27]  describes  satis¬ 
factorily  the  experimental  data  on  Al  particle  combustion  at  relatively  low  pressures  and  with  a 
formal  consideration  of  oxide  accumulation  under  laser  heating  and  in  the  flames  with  various 
compositions.  The  values  of  burning  velocity  predicted  for  high  pressure  are  substantially  lower 
than  that  in  experiments  which  makes  it  necessary  to  analyze  in  detail  the  theoretical  concepts  to 
improve  the  model. 

5.2.2.  Magnesium 
Physical  properties 

Magnesium  belongs  to  the  class  of  volatile  metals  with  nonvolatile  oxide.  The  physical  charac¬ 
teristics  of  both  Mg  and  its  oxide  are  listed  in  Table  2.

In  the  dry  air  or  oxygen  the  oxide  forms  with  a  cubic  lattice.  Its  thickness  may  reach  70  A0.  When 
the  temperature  does  not  exceed  700  K,  the  oxide  skin  displays  protective  properties,  thus  pro¬ 
viding  a  slow  oxidation  of  magnesium  according  to  the  parabolic  law.  As  the  temperature  rises 
further,  the  oxide  skin  becomes  thicker  and  loses  its  protective  properties.  Magnesium  is  oxidized 
by  the  linear  law. 

A  noticeable  evaporation  of  magnesium  starts  at  870  K.  The  pressure  of  solid  magnesium  vapors 
(below  T melt)  obeys  the  formula  below  [2]: 

log  P(mm  Hg)  =  3.27  +  2.5  log  T  -  (7636/T) 

The  pressure  of  Mg  vapors  above  the  melting  point  is  26  mm  Hg  at  1073  K,  94  mm  Hg  at  1173 
K,  and  280  mm  Hg  at  1273  K. 

Combustion  of  single  Mg  particles 

The  combustion  of  magnesium  has  been  studied  in  the  various  types  of  experimental  apparatus 
including  the  diffusion  flame  burners,  the  electric  heating  of  wires,  etc.  A  detailed  investigation 
of  the  combustion  of  Mg  particles  of  50-200  pm  on  a  laser  ignition  set-up,  used  earlier  to  study 
the  combustion  of  A1  particles  [17],  has  been  performed  in  [35],  Experiments  were  carried  out  at 
atmospheric  pressure  in  the  air  and  in  the  oxygen/argon  mixtures  varying  a  mass  fraction  of  oxy¬ 
gen  from  0.03  to  1.  The  individual  particles  were  ignited  accidentally  because  of  their  irregular 
shape  (resembling  chips)  and  the  absorption  of  laser  radiation  energy  was  dependent  on  particle 
orientation.  Usually,  the  ignition  occurred  during  0.5ms.  However,  in  low  oxygen  concentration 
mixtures  a  gradual  ignition  without  flash  was  observed  in  the  gas  phase.  Upon  combustion  in  di¬ 
lute  mixtures  the  Mg  particles  are  commonly  rounded  which  testifies  to  the  absence  of  oxide  ac¬ 
cumulation  on  their  surface.  Combustion  in  air  is  characterized  by  the  irregular  character.  In  the 
initial  phase  the  metal  jetting  is  observed.  In  the  final  stage  fragmentation  is  quite  probable.  The 
surprising  thing  is  that  the  particles,  burning  in  the  air,  often  preserve  their  irregular  shape  with  a 
noticeable  nonuniform  luminescence  over  the  surface.  It  is  assumed  then  that  upon  ignition  on 
these  particles  the  oxide  is  accumulated  which  is  preserved  in  the  solid  state  and  is,  probably,  ac¬ 
cumulated  upon  combustion.  The  irregularly  burning  particles  rotate  in  flight  with  a  rate  of  hun¬ 
dreds  to  thousands  R.P.M.  The  luminous  flame  size  is  three-fold  that  of  Mg  particles  which  indi¬ 
cates  the  existence  of  the  extended  diffusion  flame  zone. 

Interesting  observations  of  Mg  particle  behavior  (100-300  micron  size)  under  heating  in  a  glass 
tube  in  the  air  were  made  in  [36].  It  has  been  established  that  under  the  heating  rate  of  10-1000 
K/s  before  reaching  melting  temperature  the  Mg  particle  volume  increases  about  25-fold.  There¬ 
after  the  flash  is  observed  to  occur  for  3  to  80  ms.  The  combustion  products  form  a  hollow  coat¬ 
ing  with  a  rough  outer  surface  and  a  smooth  inner  surface  and  a  negligible  amount  of  white  sub¬ 
micron  particles  of  magnesium  oxide.  Special  mass-spectroscopic  measurements  showed  that  the 
melted  particle  blows  up  due  to  the  release  of  hydrogen,  which  could  not  have  been  pre-stored  in 
the  metal  and  must  have  resulted  from  decomposition  of  impurities  such  as  magnesium  hydride 
or  magnesium  hydroxide.  A  sharp  increase  in  particle  volume  causes  the  cracking  of  the  oxide 
skin,  which  allows  the  oxidizer  to  move  towards  the  metal,  which  results  in  the  heterogeneous 
oxidation  of  the  metal. 

Experiments  on  Mg  powders  produced  by  various  methods  (liquid  metal  dispersion  in  the  inert 
medium,  electrolysis,  the  cutting  of  large  metallic  pieces,  etc.)  testify  that  the  effect  of  blowing 


5—14 


under  heating  is  typical  of  this  metal.  It  is  expected  that  the  particle  blowing  was  also  recorded  in 
the  works  of  other  researchers  and  caused  both  the  formation  of  hollow  shells  with  the  sizes  ex¬ 
ceeding  the  initial  metallic  particles  [37]  and  the  anomalous  combustion  of  free  falling  particles 
[35].  Note,  however  that  as  the  medium’s  pressure  rises,  the  effect  of  blowing  is  suppressed  and 
the  transition  to  the  vapor-phase  combustion  of  magnesium  is  realized. 

The  results  of  a  study  of  Mg  particle  combustion  in  the  solid  propellant  flame  at  high  pressures 
are  presented  in  [38].  To  exclude  the  influence  of  condensation  and  coagulation  in  the  high- 
temperature  flame  zone,  the  spherical  Mg  particles  of  11.6  pm  were  introduced  into  nitrocellu¬ 
lose  in  amount  of  10%  wt.  In  this  case,  the  precalculated  flame  temperature  did  not  exceed  the 
melting  temperature  of  Mg  oxide.  The  pressed  tablets  were  combusted  at  constant  pressure  of  1- 
100  atm.  The  condensed  products  were  divided  into  fine  and  coarse  particle  fractions  and  ana¬ 
lyzed  by  their  size  and  mass.  The  fine  particle  fraction  of  combustion  products  (less  than  2  pm) 
consists  mainly  of  cubic  crystal  subjects.  At  pressures  above  20  atm  the  combustion  products 
contain  fine  spherical  particles  reaching  20-30%  in  number  at  110  atm.  Actually,  the  local  tem¬ 
perature  in  the  combustion  zone  of  an  individual  Mg  particle  may  be  higher  by  200  K  than  the 
calculated  equilibrium  flame  temperature.  The  mass  portion  of  the  fine  particle  fraction  is  about 
80  %  in  the  pressure  range  of  20-110  atm.  The  size  d3o  for  small  MgO  particles  varies  in  this 
range  from  0.36  to  0.60  pm  for  a  cubic  crystal  and  from  1.6  to  0.45  pm  for  spheres. 

A  coarse  fraction  of  combustion  products  in  the  pressure  range  of  20-110  atm  in  which  the  ag¬ 
glomeration  of  the  initial  Mg  particles  (10%  by  weight)  was  observed,  consists  of  spherical  parti¬ 
cles  close  in  size  to  the  initial  particles.  Thus,  at  85-110  atm  the  mean  size  d3o  of  coarse  particles 
in  combustion  products  is  9.2-10.4  pm  (at  20-42  atm  this  size  varies  from  5  to  8  pm).  Irradiation 
by  an  electron  beam  under  electron  microscope  shows  that  most  coarse  Mg  particles  are  hollow 
spheres.  It  is  assumed  then  that  such  particles  are  formed  due  to  both  the  heterogeneous  oxidation 
of  the  initial  metallic  particles  and  the  partial  condensation  of  oxide  on  their  surface  during  com¬ 
bustion.  A  decrease  in  the  sizes  of  particles  belonging  to  the  coarse  fraction  at  20-40  atm  may  be 
due  to  the  fragmentation  of  metallic  droplets  upon  combustion  within  a  given  pressure  range. 

The  ignition  and  combustion  of  Mg  in  CO2  is  of  specific  interest  because  these  processes  may  be 
used  to  produce  energy  under  conditions  prevailing  in  Mars.  At  the  same  time,  this  study  is  im¬ 
portant  for  explaining  Mg  combustion  in  the  flame  of  solid  propellants.  The  cylindrical  samples 
of  0.2-12  mg  supplied  with  a  thermocouple  and  corresponding  to  the  equivalent  spherical  parti¬ 
cles  with  diameter  0.64-2.36  mm,  were  heated  [39]  under  conditions  of  conductive  heat  transfer 
from  pure  CO2  or  (CO+CO2)  mixture.  The  sample  temperature,  total  luminescence  intensity,  and 
the  emissivity  spectrum  of  flame  were  measured  with  varying  initial  ambient  temperature. 

The  thermocouple  measurements  show  that  at  contact  with  hot  gas  first  an  increase  in  sample 
temperature  is  observed  and  then  a  comparatively  long  plateau  at  melting  temperature  followed 
by  a  rather  slow  linear  rise  in  the  sample  temperature.  Calculations  performed  by  the  equation  of 
heat  balance  using  the  coefficient  of  heat  exchange  determined  from  the  initial  heating  period 
produce  quite  unexpected  results.  Just  before  ignition,  the  rate  of  chemical  heat  release  was  sub¬ 
stantially  lower  than  during  metal  melting,  i.e.,  the  oxide  skin  under  heating  in  CO2  acquires 
protective  properties.  Note  that  the  heating  of  metal  was  performed  rather  slowly.  For  example, 


5—15 


when  using  coarse  samples  (equivalent  diameter  being  2.3  mm),  the  duration  of  heating  to  igni¬ 
tion  temperature  was  about  27  s  (CO2  temperature  being  1030  K),  the  melting  took  about  10  s. 

The  high-speed  movie  shows  that  the  flame  appears  at  the  local  points  on  the  sample  surface  and 
covers  gradually  the  entire  surface  to  form  the  diffusion  combustion  front  at  the  finite  distance 
from  the  surface.  When  the  sample  bums  out,  condensed  residue  remains  which  consists  of  two 
concentric  shells  with  a  porous  substance  in  the  layer  between  the  shells.  The  inner  shell  is  black 
due  to  the  presence  of  pure  carbon  which  is  assumed  to  favor  the  strengthening  of  the  protective 
properties  of  the  oxide  skin  under  heating  before  ignition  and  only  the  mechanical  destruction  by 
metal  vapors  with  their  subsequent  inflammation  gives  rise  to  the  flame.  A  particular  feature  of 
Mg  ignition  in  pure  CO2  is  in  the  fact  that  the  temperature  of  liquid  metal  exceeds  that  of  its 
boiling  at  a  given  pressure.  For  1-mm  particles  this  difference  reaches  300-400  K.  It  is  suggested 
then  that  the  pressure  of  metal  vapor  under  the  solid  oxide  skin  may  be  substantially  higher  than 
the  ambient  pressure  (according  to  estimate,  up  to  10  atm  for  particle  diameter  of  1  mm).  It  is 
also  assumed  that  the  emission  of  luminous  fragments  from  the  surface  of  Mg  particles,  burning 
in  CO2,  provides  a  periodic  decrease  in  pressure  within  the  oxide  skin.  Experiments  in  air  show 
the  destmction  of  the  burning  Mg  droplets  [40]  which  is  attributed  to  the  appearance  of  excess 
pressure  under  overheating  and  to  the  existence  of  a  less  solid  oxide  skin. 

Diluting  CO2  by  carbon  monoxide  weakens  the  combustion  intensity.  When  CO  concentration  (in 
the  mixture  with  CO2)  exceeds  25%,  the  burning  time  of  coarse  Mg  particles  increases  2-3-fold. 
The  spectral  measurements  show  that  unlike  combustion  in  CO2  and  in  air,  in  the  CO  medium 
there  is  no  radiation  zone  with  a  continuum  spectrum.  The  combustion  residues  contain  no  fine- 
disperse  products.  It  is  assumed  that  the  combustion  in  CO  occurs  mainly  in  the  heterogeneous 
regime  with  a  distant  zone  of  homogeneous  oxidation  of  metal  vapors. 

Mathematical  modeling  of  Mg  particle  combustion. 

A  simplified  model  of  Mg  combustion  in  oxygen  [2]  considers  a  spherical  particle  with  surface 
temperature  equal  to  that  of  metal  boiling.  The  evaporated  metal  reacts  with  oxygen  at  some  dis¬ 
tance  from  the  surface  (the  internal  flame  boundary)  at  temperature  exceeding  the  boiling  tem¬ 
perature  of  oxide.  This  assumption  is  based  on  the  exothermicity  of  the  purely  gas-phase  reaction 
Mg(g)  +  0.5002(g)  — >  MgO(g).  A  part  of  the  forming  gaseous  oxide  diffuses  to  the  metal  surface 
and  is  condensed  with  heat  release.  The  remaining  part  diffuses  outward  and  is  condensed  at  the 
outer  boundary  of  the  extended  flame  zone  in  which  the  gas  temperature  drops  to  that  of  oxide 
boiling.  The  model  predicts  that  the  extent  of  the  flame  zone  (the  distance  between  the  inner  and 
outer  boundaries)  decreases  with  decreasing  oxygen  concentration  in  the  medium.  This  points  to 
a  decrease  in  the  oxide  deposition  intensity  on  the  metallic  particle,  burning  in  the  diluted  me¬ 
dium  that  is  confirmed  experimentally.  The  model  also  predicts  the  value  of  the  radius  of  the  ex¬ 
ternal  flame  zone.  However,  the  times  calculated  for  combustion  in  air  are  almost  two-fold  (and 
in  the  diluted  media  5-fold)  shorter  than  the  experimental  ones.  It  is  assumed  that  this  discrep¬ 
ancy  is  caused  by  unsatisfactory  description  of  the  solid  oxide  formation  on  the  metal  that  leads 
to  a  change  in  the  heat  exchange. 

Attempts  to  describe  theoretically  the  initial  phases  of  Mg  particle  oxidation  and  ignition  in  oxy¬ 
gen  were  undertaken  in  [41].  It  is  reported  that  at  relatively  low  temperatures  the  Mg  oxidation  is 
mainly  heterogeneous  but  beginning  with  600  K  the  experimentally  determined  oxidation  rate  is 


5—16 


in  fair  agreement  with  the  calculated  velocity  of  metal  evaporation.  It  is  concluded  then  that  at 
high  temperature  the  contribution  of  heterogeneous  reaction  to  the  mass  velocity  of  metal  oxida¬ 
tion  must  be  negligible  and  the  ignition  is  mainly  caused  by  the  reaction  of  vapor  oxidation  oc¬ 
curring  near  the  metal  surface  [41]. 

5.2.3.  Boron 
Physical  properties 

Boron  exists  in  two  modifications:  amorphous  (fine-crystalline)  brown,  and  crystalline  dark-gray. 
By  combustion  mode,  the  boron  may  be  referred  to  the  class  of  nonvolatile  metals  with  a  volatile 
oxide.  The  physical  properties  of  boron  and  its  oxide  are  listed  in  Table  3.

The  pressure  of  boron  vapors  at  2000K  is  10‘4  atm  and  at  2400K  it  is  10'2  atm.  The  amorphous 
boron  is  slowly  oxidized  in  the  air  at  room  temperature.  Being  heated  to  1 100K  in  the  air  it  is  ig¬ 
nited  and  bums  giving  a  bright  flame.  The  coarse  boron  crystals  are  more  stable  and  are  difficult 
to  ignite. 

Combustion  of  single  B  particles. 

In  early  experiments  [42,43]  on  single  particles,  heated  in  a  flat-flame  burner,  it  has  been  estab¬ 
lished  that  when  the  boron  particles  are  heated  to  1800-2000  K,  they  are  ignited  and  bum  first 
with  flame  of  moderate  luminosity,  then  fade  out  and  later  begin  to  bum  with  brighter  luminosity. 
It  is  usually  assumed  that  boron  bums  first  in  the  presence  of  a  semiprotective  oxide  coating, 
which  is  removed  by  reaction  and  evaporation.  In  the  second  the  longest  phase,  the  particle  bums 
with  the  reactions  on  the  pure  metal  surface  and  with  formation  of  suboxides,  transforming  into 
the  final  combustion  products  at  a  given  distance  from  the  surface  [44]. 

Despite  extensive  investigations,  a  description  of  ignition  and  of  the  initial  stage  of  B  particle 
combustion  is  based  on  quite  different  approaches.  Using  general  concepts  and  analyzing  the  re¬ 
sults  of  investigations  of  a  comparatively  slow  boron  oxidation,  it  is  assumed  that  oxygen  diffu¬ 
sion  to  metal  through  liquid  oxide  skin  determines  the  process  characteristics  in  the  initial  com¬ 
bustion  phase  [44,45].  There  is,  however,  another  version  according  to  which  the  most  important 
role  belongs  to  boron  dissolving  and  diffusion  in  liquid  oxide  [46,5].  Indeed,  according  to  [46], 
the  liquid  oxide  has  a  vitreous  state  and  must  not  form  the  fixed  molecular  bonds.  Therefore  it 
was  suggested  that  the  oxygen  dissolving  in  the  oxide  skin  is  hindered  and  the  skin  composition 
due  to  the  presence  of  dissolved  boron  becomes  B20x  where  x  <  3. 


5—17 


The  ideas  proposed  in  [46]  were  used  in  [47,48]  to  interpret  theoretically  the  experimental  data 
on  boron  particle  ignition.  According  to  theoretical  notions,  the  boron  dissolving  in  liquid  oxide 
is  followed  by  the  formation  of  suboxide  BO  which  is  attacked  by  the  gaseous  molecules  O2  and 
H2O  at  the  gas-liquid  interface  which  results  in  gaseous  BO2  or  HOBO  and  causes  the  evapora¬ 
tion  of  B2O3  from  the  surface.  Analyzing  a  theoretical  model,  one  may  see  that  an  alternative  hy¬ 
pothesis  of  oxygen  dissolving  in  liquid  oxide  and  of  the  basic  heat  release  on  particle  surface  [44] 
results  in  a  continuous  growth  of  oxide  skin,  temperature  decrease  under  constant  laser  heating, 
and  the  absence  of  ignition.  The  latter  sharply  contradicts  experiment.  If  we  assume  that  the  main 
heat  release  occurs  in  the  gas  phase,  we  may  explain  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  the  experi¬ 
mental  dependence  of  ignition  time  on  ambient  pressure  and  temperature.  It  is  important  to  note 
that  unlike  true  metals,  aluminum  and  magnesium;  boron  has  a  very  low  thermal  diffusivity  at 
high  temperature  (5xl0'3  cm2/s  at  2000  K).  This  determines  the  purely  technical  difficulties  of 
boron  particle  ignition.  For  example,  they  cannot  be  ignited  by  the  pulses  of  laser  radiation  using 
a  set-up  for  ignition  of  the  A1  and  Mg  particles. 

Important  experimental  information  obtained  in  [49-51]  allows  us  to  substantiate  the  hypothesis 
of  boron  dissolving  in  liquid  oxide  in  the  stages  of  heating  and  ignition.  The  visual  observations 
using  an  environmental  scanning  electron  microscope  show  that  under  heating  in  the  oxygen- 
containing  medium  on  a  ceramic  substrate  to  1213  K,  a  series  of  small  boron  crystals  with  initial 
size  of  2-3  pm  melt  and  coalesce  into  a  droplet.  The  boron  content  in  the  crystals  was  93%.  The  3 
pm  particles  of  amorphous  boron  with  99.9%  purity  demonstrated  a  similar  behavior  under  simi¬ 
lar  conditions.  Additional  experiments  on  heating  in  Ar  have  confirmed  the  fact  of  B  particles 
melting  at  1213  K,  and  the  experiments  performed  in  H2O  vapors  gave  an  even  lower  tempera¬ 
ture  (ca.1100  K)  of  complete  liquefaction.  To  elucidate  the  nature  of  melted  particles,  measure¬ 
ments  were  performed  by  the  method  of  X-ray  diffraction.  Note  that  the  liquefaction  temperature 
is  almost  twice  that  of  pure  boron  melting  (ca.2400K,  [49]).  The  X-ray  analysis  showed  that  the 
liquefied  material  has  amorphous  structure.  According  to  the  literature  data  it  is  assumed  that  this 
material  is  a  boron  monoxide  polymer,  (BO)n  which  is  indirectly  confirmed  not  only  by  the 
amorphous  structure  but  also  the  brown  color,  water  and  methanol  insolubility,  fragility  and 
hardness  of  the  cooled  materials. 

Analyzing  the  available  experimental  data  and  the  theoretical  concepts,  a  mathematical  model, 
describing  two  successive  stages  of  boron  combustion,  was  formulated  [49].  In  the  first  stage  it 
takes  into  account  not  only  the  formation  of  liquid  (BO)n  but  also  the  dissociative  evaporation  of 
the  oxide  skin  with  B2O2  formation  as  well  as  the  heterogeneous  reactions  of  the  suboxides  sub¬ 
stance  with  02(g)  and  H20(g)  generating  B02(g)  and  HOBO(g),  respectively.  The  duration  of  the 
first  stage  was  taken  as  the  sum  of  the  time  necessary  for  the  complete  removal  of  the  B2O3 
coating,  and  the  time  required  to  reach  the  melting  point  of  boron.  A  comparison  between  the 
calculated  and  experimental  times  shows  a  satisfactory  agreement.  As  the  ambient  temperature 
and  pressure  or  oxidizer  concentration  rise,  the  duration  of  the  first  stage  decreases.  There  is  also 
a  fair  agreement  between  experiment  and  calculations  of  the  duration  of  the  second  combustion 
stage,  performed  for  two  limiting  cases,  respectively:  diffusion  and  kinetic  control  combustion 
mechanisms.  It  has  been  shown  that  if  P-d  «  75  atm-pm,  the  combustion  of  boron  particles  fol¬ 
lows  mainly  the  kinetic  control  mechanism.  On  the  contrary,  if  P-d  »  75  atm- pm,  the  combus¬ 
tion  is  limited  by  oxygen  diffusion.

5.3.  METAL  POWDER  AGGLOMERATION  AT  THE  BURNING  SURFACE  OF 
SOLID  PROPELLANT 

The  distinctive  features  of  metallic  particle  properties  compared  to  other  propellant  components, 
such  as  a  low  volatility  at  the  temperature  of  combustion  surface  and  the  existence  of  a  protective 
oxide  coating  which  determines  relatively  low  metal  reactivity,  lead  to  the  accumulation  of  metal 
on  the  surface  and  to  the  formation  of  the  so-called  agglomerates.  An  additional  reason  for  metal 
accumulation  on  the  burning  surface  is  also  the  effect  of  a  decrease  in  transient  burning  rate 
caused  by  the  metal,  which  serves  as  a  heat  sink  in  the  combustion  wave.  Note  that  the  structure 
of  heterogeneous  propellants  determines  the  formation  of  the  aggregates  of  small  metallic  parti¬ 
cles  at  weight  concentrations  of  16-22%,  which  are  quite  typical  of  solid  propellants.  Below,  it 
will  be  shown  that  in  this  case  each  particle  has  several  contacts  with  the  neighboring  ones. 
Therefore,  under  corresponding  conditions,  the  agglomerates  on  the  burning  surface  within  the 
limits  of  a  conventional  "pocket"  in  solid  propellant  represent  a  joining  of  several  hundreds  or 
thousands  of  virgin  metallic  particles. 

Concerning  the  practical  use  of  metallized  solid  propellants,  agglomeration  is  an  unfavorable 
phenomenon,  which  leads  to  the  losses  of  chemical  and  mechanical  energies  in  a  rocket  motor 
due  to  the  metal  combustion  incompleteness  and  the  nonequilibrium  state  of  two-phase  flow. 
Thus,  experimental  and  theoretical  studies  of  agglomeration  are  carried  out  for  understanding  the 
mechanism  of  this  phenomenon  and  for  developing  the  methods  of  influence  on  the  size  distribu¬ 
tion  of  the  condensed  combustion  products.  These  investigations  have  been  under  way  from  the 
beginning  of  the  60s  [52,53].  A  great  body  of  information  has  been  extracted  although  the  prob¬ 
lem  is  still  far  from  being  solved. 

In  the  Soviet  literature  this  phenomenon  is  for  the  first  time  recorded  in  the  works,  devoted  to  the 
study  of  combustion  of  homogeneous  SP  with  the  additives  of  metal,  carried  out  in  the  beginning 
of  the  60’s  under  P.F.  Pokhil’s  supervision  [52].  Approximately  at  this  time  analogous  investiga¬ 
tions  were  performed  in  the  West.  During  the  prolonged  period  the  accumulations  of  the  qualita¬ 
tive  information  occurred,  on  the  basis  of  which  original  concepts  were  build  about  the  agglom¬ 
erating  process.  Thus,  in  the  early  work  of  American  scientists  the  hypothesis  was  formulated 
about  the  formation  of  coarse  A1  particles  on  the  burning  surface  due  to  the  accidental  rendezvous 
of  the  moving  over  the  surface  original  particles  of  metal  [54]. 

Then  this  hypothesis  has  been  strongly  criticized  and  there  were  first  formulated  [55]  qualitative 
concepts  about  the  formation  of  agglomerates  due  to  merging  the  particles  of  the  metal,  which  are 
situated  within  the  “pockets”  of  binder  between  the  coarse  grains  of  oxidizer.  During  the  subse¬ 
quent  years  considerable  attention  was  paid  to  the  study  of  the  behavior  of  metallic  particles  in 
the  process  of  rapid  heating  [56,57].  It  should  be  also  noted  the  contribution  of  French  research¬ 
ers  [58],  whose  results  were  not  widely  known  in  combustion  community  and  were  repeated  in 
other  works. 

Note  that  the  early  investigations  have  been  performed  using  solid  propellants,  containing  mainly 
ammonium  perchlorate  and  "inert"  fuel-binders  of  similar  composition  (polybutadiene,  polyure¬ 
thane,  etc.).  These  propellants  demonstrate  similar  characteristics  of  agglomeration  which  makes 
one  think  that  the  phenomenon  is  studied.  The  latter  two  decades  are  characterized  by  a  consider- 


5—19 


able  growth  in  the  number  of  used  components  of  solid  propellants:  the  application  of  nitramines 
and  ADN  (ammonium  dinintramide)  instead  of  ammonium  perchlorate  and  various  "active" 
binders  instead  of  inert  polymers.  Obviously,  the  available  concept  of  the  mechanism  of  metal 
combustion  in  solid  propellants  fails  to  predict  the  composition  of  combustion  products  and  the 
completeness  of  metal  transformation. 

According  to  general  notions,  in  the  surface  layer  of  the  burning  solid  propellant  there  occur  the 
heating  of  metallic  particles  and  a  partial  decomposition  of  a  binder.  In  many  cases,  the  metallic 
particles  are  inside  the  "carcass",  consisting  of  the  residues  of  the  decomposing  binder,  and  sinter 
to  form  the  ill  defined  "accumulates".  At  low  pressures  the  burning  surface  temperature  is  lower 
than  that  of  metal  melting.  At  high  pressures  the  metal  melts  just  on  the  burning  surface  and  then 
starts  to  react  heterogeneously  and/or  in  a  vapor-phase  with  the  oxidizer.  The  further  heating  of 
metallic  particles  due  to  both  heat  exchange  with  flame  and  chemical  heat  release  leads  to  the 
coalescence  of  separate  particles  into  a  large  droplet  and  to  agglomerate  ignition.  This  sequence 
of  events  is  shown  in  detail  in  Figs. 5.4  and  5.5  on  examples  of  “poorly”  and  “readily”  agglomer¬ 
ating  propellants,  correspondingly.

The  observations  were  made  via  high  speed  movie  performed  with  propellants  burning  at  atmos¬ 
pheric  pressure  under  backlit  illumination.  Obviously,  the  behavior  of  metallic  particle  aggregates 
depends  on  the  propellant  type.  In  the  poorly  agglomerating  propellants  the  formation  of  particle 
filigrees  on  the  burning  surface  is  followed  by  ignition  of  the  top  and  by  coalescence  of  particles 
into  a  large  droplet  (Fig.  4).  For  the  readily  agglomerating  propellants  the  particle  coalescence 
and  ignition  occur  within  the  limits  of  the  surface  layer  (Fig.5).  Besides,  the  intermediate  case 
may  be  realized  where  the  separating  nonbuming  metallic  aggregate  coalesces  into  a  droplet  at  a 


comparatively  large  distance  from  the  burning  surface  and  is  ignited  to  form  a  closed  aureole 
which  is  then  destroyed  and  transforms  into  a  typical  "smoke"  tail.  It  is  assumed  then  that  the 
closed  aureole  corresponds  to  a  thin  liquid  oxide  coating,  existing  during  a  short  period  of  time 
and  which  is  difficult  to  shoot.  An  exact  explanation  of  this  phenomenon  is  still  unavailable.

The  A1  agglomerate,  separating  from  the  surface,  bums  usually  to  form  the  oxide  cap  and  rotates 
upon  motion  in  the  flame.  The  agglomerate  is  surrounded  by  the  zone  of  luminous  flame  and  of 
stoichiometric  oxide  condensation.  The  suboxide  AlO  in  a  gaseous  form  has  been  recorded  in  the 
flame  zone  [24],  which  indicates  that  the  agglomerate  combustion  is  similar  in  principle  to  that  of 
a  coarse  A1  particle.  However,  the  prehistory  of  agglomerate  formation  leaves  the  imprint  on  its 
inner  composition  and  on  the  combustion  law.  In  particular,  the  extinguished  agglomerates  very 
often  exhibit  complex  structure  with  small  individual  A1  particles  inside  covering  oxide  shell.

A  study  of  agglomerates,  collected  from  the  extinguished  surface  of  solid  propellant  [59]  and  in 
the  residues  of  the  condensed  combustion  products  [60],  shows  that  agglomerates  exist  not  only 
in  the  form  of  large  metallic  particles  with  an  oxide  cap  but  also  as  coarse  particles  of  a  "matrix" 
type,  existing  at  relatively  low  pressures  (see  Fig.5.6  with  typical  view  of  combustion  residues). 
The  latter  consist  mainly  of  AI2O3  with  inclusions  of  pure  metal.  They  are  assumed  to  form  in  the 
case  where  the  propellant  surface  has  a  gas-permeable  carbon  carcass  whose  temperature  exceeds 
the  ignition  temperature  of  metallic  particles.  Thus,  the  metallic  particles  that  have  not  yet  sepa¬ 
rated  from  the  burning  propellant  are  ignited  within  the  carcass  and  react  to  an  essential  degree  of 
consumption.  The  agglomerates  of  extra  large  size  are  formed  upon  combustion  under  the  action 
of  mass  forces.  Under  acceleration,  directed  to  the  burning  surface,  the  agglomerates  cannot  sepa¬ 
rate  and  are  accumulated  on  the  surface  to  form  at  relatively  high  accelerations  (50-100  g)  parti¬ 
cles  of  several  mm  in  size.  With  prolonged  acceleration,  a  solid  layer  of  melted  aluminum  and  its 
oxide  may  appear  on  the  surface  [61]. 

The  problem  of  coarse  agglomerate  formation  upon  combustion  in  the  acceleration  field  is  related 
to  the  practical  problem  of  slag  formation  in  rotating  rocket  motors  [62],  This  problem  should  be 
solved  under  rigid  restrictions  on  the  burning  rate  to  satisfy  the  given  technical  requirements. 
Therefore,  of  interest  are  the  data  on  a  change  in  the  agglomeration  degree  with  varying  propel¬ 
lant  composition  at  almost  unchanged  burning  rate.  In  particular,  it  has  been  established  [62]  that 
the  introduction  of  a  fine-disperse  oxidizer  (tri-modal  size  distribution  instead  of  the  bimodal 
one)  reduces  the  agglomerate  size  and  the  substitution  of  HMX  by  RDX  leads  to  an  increase  in 
agglomerate  size.  Below,  we  report  briefly  on  the  influence  of  various  factors  on  metal  agglom¬ 
eration. 

5.3.1.  Influence  of  various  factors  on  agglomerate  size. 

The  data  on  agglomerate  dispersion  are  convenient  to  compare  using  a  general  approach  such  as 
the  calculation  of  a  function  of  particle  size  distribution  and  the  characteristic  Dmn  sizes  on  its  ba¬ 
sis: 

Dmn  =  (EDimNi/XDinNi)1/(m'n) 

In  this  case  Di  is  the  middle  of  size  interval  in  the  histogram;  Nj  is  the  number  of  particles  in  a 
given  size  interval.  In  addition,  the  results  of  a  granulometric  analysis  can  be  represented  as  an 
integral  distribution  function  with  determination  of  the  size,  corresponding  to  a  given  per  cent 
(e.g.  D50,  50%)  of  the  number  of  particles  or  to  their  total  mass. 

The  size  of  initial  metallic  particles  has  effect  on  the  agglomeration  degree  in  the  combustion 
wave.  It  is  known  [2]  that  the  metal  powder  is  agglomerated  at  a  threshold  concentration.  For  ex¬ 
ample,  for  the  A1  particles  with  size  1  pm  the  threshold  concentration  is  1%  by  weight;  for  the  10 
pm  particles  it  amounts  to  2-3%  by  weight;  for  the  50-70  pm  ones  it  is  5-7%  by  weight  and  the 
160  m  particles  are  not  agglomerated  up  to  10%  concentrations.  These  figures  may  vary  depend¬ 
ing  on  the  properties  of  the  oxide  layer,  metal  purity,  and  the  quality  of  propellant  mass  mixing. 
They  reflect,  however,  the  main  tendency:  the  smaller  are  the  metallic  particles,  the  lower  is  the 
threshold.  Note  that  in  our  experiments  when  using  the  ultrafine  A1  particles  ALEX  (A1  particle 
size  being  less  than  0.5  pm,  the  content  in  propellant  equals  18%  by  weight)  the  combustion  of 
traditional  propellants  based  on  ammonium  perchlorate  and  the  inert  binder  in  air  resulted  in  the 
formation  of  10-30  pm  agglomerates. 


The  influence  of  pressure  is  determined  by  two  factors:  a  rise  in  the  burning  surface  temperature 
(and  in  flame)  as  well  as  in  the  burning  rate.  The  temperature  factors  intensify  agglomeration  due 
to  a  stronger  reaction  of  metal  in  the  surface  layer.  However,  an  increase  in  the  burning  rate  leads 
to  a  decrease  in  the  residence  time  of  particles  in  the  heating  zone.  The  empirical  facts  testify 
mainly  to  a  decrease  of  agglomerate  sizes  with  rising  pressure. 

The  size  of  the  oxidizer  particles  determines  a  geometrical  structure  of  solid  propellants  and  the 
coarse  oxidizer  particles  are  directly  related  to  the  size  of  the  binder  "pocket"  containing  small 
metallic  particles.  A  general  tendency  is  in  the  fact  that  the  larger  are  the  coarse  oxidizer  parti¬ 
cles,  the  larger  are  the  forming  agglomerates.  Note  that  for  given  oxidizers  size  the  size  of  ag¬ 
glomerates  depends  on  the  quality  of  propellant  mass  mixing.  In  particular,  using  "gelatinization" 
instead  of  mechanical  mixing  to  prepare  model  propellant  with  7%  of  A1  weight  has  caused  a 
substantial  (about  1.5-fold)  decrease  in  agglomerate  size  [2]. 

The  properties  of  the  metal  exhibit  their  effect  through  a  complex  of  the  characteristics  of  pure 
metal,  its  oxide,  and  foreign  impurities.  Practically  all  metals  tend  to  agglomerate  in  the  combus¬ 
tion  wave.  Experiments  on  the  pressed  samples  AP/polyformaldehyde/20%  Metal  burning  out  at 
30  atm  showed  [2]  that  the  A1  particles  (<lpm)  reach  the  size  of  D50=22  pm  and  the  Mg  particles 
(<  1.5  pm)  reach  only  16  pm  size.  In  this  case,  however,  the  burning  rate  of  Mg  containing  sam¬ 
ples  is  higher  which  may  also  cause  a  decrease  in  agglomerate  size.  It  is  reported  [38]  that  at  a 
relatively  low  content  of  Mg  in  the  propellant  (10%  of  weight)  the  agglomerates,  forming  at  pres¬ 
sures  up  to  20  atm,  are  the  accumulates  consisting  of  the  partially  burning  initial  (11.6  pm)  me¬ 
tallic  particles.  The  sampled  accumulates  can  be  readily  destroyed  under  ultrasonic  treatment. 

The  high  speed  movie  of  the  combustion  of  the  pressed  sodium  nitrate/magnesium  (70/30  by 
weight)  mixtures  in  the  air  shows  interesting  peculiarities  of  both  metal  agglomeration  and  burn¬ 
ing  surface  destruction  [63].  The  Mg  particle  size  was  10-60  pm,  sodium  nitrate  was  used  as  ei¬ 
ther  coarse  (125-230  pm)  or  fine  (<  40  pm)  fraction.  Note  that  with  the  volume  content  of  metal 
in  a  given  mixture  of  about  40%,  the  metallic  particles  form  a  continuous  interconnected  struc¬ 
ture.  Nevertheless,  in  the  samples  containing  a  coarse  grain  oxidizer  we  assume  the  formation  of 
the  so-called  "pockets"  with  the  metal  that  fills  the  gaps  between  oxidizer  particles.  The  movie 
shows  that  in  the  gas  phase  above  the  surface  there  is  a  great  number  of  nonluminous  particles 
and  a  smaller  number  of  the  luminous  ones.  The  latter  are,  as  a  rule,  larger  and  are  observed  in 
the  form  of  the  burning  magnesium  agglomerates.  Upon  combustion  of  samples  with  a  fine  grain 
oxidizer  we  record  the  relatively  coarse  particles  detached  from  the  surface.  Later,  they  are  ig¬ 
nited  in  the  flame.  The  majority  of  nonluminous  particles  are,  presumably,  the  liquid  droplets  of 
the  products  of  sodium  nitrate  thermal  decomposition.  Their  characteristic  size  is  Dso=52  pm  for 
the  propellants  with  coarse  oxidizer  and  Dso=55  pm  for  those  with  a  fine  oxidizer  with  a  more 
"smeared"  size  distribution  function  of  particles.  The  characteristic  size  of  burning  agglomerates 
for  the  sample  with  a  coarse  oxidizer  is  D3  =125  pm.  It  should  be  noted  that  when  the  burning 
rate  equals  1-2  mm/s  the  coarse  sodium  nitrate  particles,  passing  to  the  burning  surface,  are  as¬ 
sumed  not  to  have  enough  time  to  melt  completely  if  they  do  not  stay  on  the  burning  surface.  It  is 
suggested  that  the  heating  of  the  oxidizer  surface  layer  due  to  heat  transfer  through  the  metallic 
carcass  leads  to  the  partial  decomposition  of  sodium  nitrate  and  to  the  emission  of  partially  lique¬ 
fied  particles  into  the  flame.

The  formation  of  coarse  agglomerates  was  recorded  upon  combustion  of  pressed  samples  with  a 
high  content  of  Mg  (40-70%  of  weight)  and  sodium  nitrate  as  the  oxidizer  [64].  The  initial  50  pm 
Mg  particles  coarsened  in  the  combustion  wave  at  10  atm  to  150-550  pm.  The  data  on  agglomer¬ 
ate  structure  were  not  reported  [64]. 

The  boron  agglomeration  in  solid  propellant  combustion  has  been  observed  in  a  number  of  works 
[2,44,45].  The  quantitative  information  is,  however,  rather  scarce.  Therefore,  of  great  interest  are 
the  data  [65]  on  a  comparative  study  of  agglomeration  upon  combustion  of  propellants  with  pure 
aluminum,  pure  boron,  and  their  mixture.  Experiments  were  carried  out  at  pressures  from  1  to 
100  atm.  The  residence  time  of  condensed  particles  in  the  flame  was  3-10ms.  The  condensed 
combustion  products  were  collected  in  water  and  then  analyzed  by  their  sizes  and  the  content  of 
pure  metal.  Upon  combustion  of  propellants  containing  70%  of  AP  (400  pm,  200  pm,  20  pm), 
20%  of  nitro-binder  (polyethylene  glycol  elasticized  with  butanetriol  trinitrate)  and  10%  of  B  (6.8 
pm  crystals)  it  has  been  established  that  the  combustion  efficiency  of  boron  in  agglomerates  in¬ 
creases  with  pressure  from  10%  (1  atm)  to  65%  (100  atm).  In  this  case,  the  median  volume  di¬ 
ameter  of  agglomerates  increases  from  28  pm  to  36  pm.  Substituting  30%  of  crystalline  boron  by 
amorphous  boron  (1.3  pm)  leads  to  doubling  of  the  combustion  efficiency  at  1  atm  but  has  actu¬ 
ally  no  effect  at  100  atm.  The  microscopic  studies  show  that  the  condensed  combustion  products 
have  irregular  shape  at  low  pressures  and  become  spherical  at  high  pressures.  An  increase  in  ag¬ 
glomerate  size  with  pressure  is  explained  in  [65]  in  terms  of  the  possible  agglomeration  in  the  gas 
flame  in  which  the  high  temperature  is  realized.  Using  experimental  data  on  gaseous  combustion 
products,  testifying  to  the  high  (compared  with  equilibrium)  CO2  concentration,  the  conclusion 
has  been  drawn  on  the  advantageous  oxidation  of  hydrocarbons  in  the  flame  near  the  propellant 
surface  that  causes  oxygen  deficit  for  boron  oxidation.  Thus,  a  relatively  low  rate  of  boron  oxida¬ 
tion  is  the  reason  for  the  impossibility  of  reaching  equilibrium  and  determines  low  combustion 
efficiency  of  boron. 

Making  special  coating  over  metallic  particles  may  solve  the  problem  of  ignition  promotion.  The 
theoretical  estimates  for  boron  particles  are  described  in  [44].  Zirconium,  titanium,  and  lithium 
fluoride  are  proposed  as  coatings.  It  is  assumed  that  the  oxidation  of  coating  makes  the  tempera¬ 
ture  rise  to  the  level  at  which  B2O3  boils.  The  former  must  free  the  boron  surface  of  oxide  and 
lead  to  ignition.  According  to  calculations,  the  boron  particles  of  2-10  pm  may  be  ignited  at  at¬ 
mospheric  pressure  in  a  gas  medium  at  1900K  and  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  of  0.1  atm  and  of 
water  vapor  of  0.1  atm  by  spreading  either  the  layer  of  titanium  amounting  to  11%  or  of  zirco¬ 
nium  amounting  to  8%  of  the  weight  of  the  boron  particle.  It  should  be  noted  that  at  this  ambient 
temperature  there  is  no  ignition  of  pure  boron  particles.  The  layer  of  lithium  fluoride,  according 
to  [44],  may  also  provide  the  ignition  of  boron  particles  at  1900  K. 

Experimental  data  are  available  on  the  influence  of  coating  on  the  agglomeration  of  A1  particles 
[65]  upon  combustion  of  solid  propellants.  Copper,  nickel,  and  iron  were  used  as  coating  in  order 
to  increase  the  melting  temperature  of  a  particle  and  thus  to  prevent  the  coalescence  of  particles 
within  the  burning  surface.  The  coating  of  about  0.1  pm  was  spread  by  chemical  precipitation 
from  the  solution  of  corresponding  salts.  The  experiments  on  combustion  in  air  of  the  pressed 
mixtures  AP/PMMA+2%A1  with  a  nickel  coating  show  that  the  sizes  of  A1  agglomerates  de¬ 
crease  1.5-fold,  the  ignition  of  A1  particles  occurs  at  a  smaller  distance  from  the  burning  surface. 


5—24 


Similar  data  were  obtained  for  copper  and  iron  coatings.  Note,  however,  that  the  quantitative  re¬ 
sults  on  agglomeration  [65]  were  obtained  only  on  the  basis  of  indirect  data  on  the  luminescence 
intensity  of  the  two-phase  flow  of  combustion  products  (the  number  of  luminescent  tracks). 

Interesting  are  the  results  [66]  on  a  study  of  the  inflammation  in  air  of  the  cloud  of  A1  particles 
covered  by  a  thin  nickel  layer  (1-3%  of  particle  weight,  thickness  being  50-180  A).  With  the  op¬ 
timal  thickness  of  the  coating  the  protecting  nickel  layer  prevents  aluminum  from  oxidation  in  the 
initial  heating  stage.  However,  when  the  melting  temperature  of  aluminum  is  reached,  the  nickel 
layer  cracks  due  to  a  double  difference  in  the  coefficients  of  volumetric  expansion  and  is  re¬ 
moved  which  bares  the  surface  of  pure  aluminum  and  makes  it  to  react  with  an  oxidizer.  The 
maximum  effect  is  provided  by  the  nickel  coating  with  a  thickness  of  about  100  A.  In  this  case, 
the  flame  propagation  velocity  over  the  A1  powder  cloud  with  volume  median  size  D3o=10  pm 
increases  1.5-4  times  depending  on  the  oxidizer  content  in  the  gas  medium. 

The  influence  of  the  binder  and  oxidizer  nature,  i.e.  the  chemical  composition  of  the  propellant,  is 
the  most  difficult  problem  for  studying  and  analyzing.  Obviously,  the  variations  in  chemical 
composition  may  substantially  change  the  characteristic  temperatures  in  the  combustion  wave, 
the  residence  times  and  the  physicochemical  properties  of  components.  Besides,  the  results  are 
often  difficult  to  compare  due  to  the  difference  in  the  particle  sizes  of  components  and  the  meth¬ 
ods  of  selection  and  analysis  of  the  condensed  phase. 

A  comparative  study  of  A1  agglomeration  upon  combustion  in  the  pressure  range  5-40  atm  of  the 
pressed  AP/fuel  mixtures  has  been  performed  in  [67].  Polymethylmethacrylate  (PMMA),  poly¬ 
formaldehyde  (PFA),  naphthalene,  and  carbon  with  added  0.5%  paraffin  were  used  as  fuels.  The 
tendency  to  agglomeration,  estimated  by  the  characteristic  size  D50,  increases  in  the  series 
PFA/PMM A/naphthalene/carbon.  Actually,  the  agglomeration  for  the  mixtures  with  PMMA  and 
PFA  was  almost  the  same  and  less  pronounced.  The  introduction  of  naphthalene  and  carbon 
caused  a  considerable  increase  in  the  size  of  agglomerates.  Thus,  with  P=40  atm  for  the 
AP+PFA+20%A1  mixture  D50=42  |xm  and  for  AP+PMMA+20%A1  Dso=46  pm,  and  for  the 
AP+naphthalene+20%Al  mixture  D5o=180  pm  in  air  m  and  for  AP+C+20%A1  Dso=200  pm.  Sub¬ 
stituting  ammonium  perchlorate  by  potassium  perchlorate  made  the  above  sequence  of  fuels  un¬ 
changed  with  respect  to  agglomeration.  In  this  case,  however,  the  size  of  agglomerates  decreased 
by  about  20-30%. 

Attempts  to  study  the  influence  of  the  binder  on  the  formation  of  the  condensed  residues  of  the 
combustion  of  aluminized  propellants  were  made  in  [68].  Experiments  were  performed  using 
three  propellants  containing  17.5%  weight  of  A1  and  differing  in  the  binder  type.  Two  binders 
were  inert:  polybutadiene  with  carboxy  terminated  groups  (CTPB)  and  tri-functional  polypropyl¬ 
ene  glycol  (TPE);  the  third  binder  was  energetic,  polyethylene  glycol  with  energetic  plasticizer 
bis  (2-fluoro-2,2-dinitroethyl)  formal,  PEG/FEFO. 

The  preliminary  experiments  on  thermal  decomposition  of  binders  in  argon  with  a  heating  rate  of 
50  K/min  show  that  CTPB  decomposes  completely  at  485°C  and  evaporates  without  bubbles. 
TPE  is  fully  liquefied  at  300°C  and  under  further  heating  it  evaporates  with  moderate  gas  and 
bubble  formation.  The  active  binder  PEG/FEFO  is  liquefied  at  220°C  and  boils  to  form  gas  bub¬ 
bles.  At  240°C  it  converts  into  the  brown  liquid.  When  AP  is  introduced  into  the  binder,  CTPB 


5—25 


decomposes,  interacting  negligibly  with  AP.  At  303  C  the  character  of  TPE  decomposition 
changes  and  the  gas  release  of  the  TPE+AP  system  increases.  The  interaction  between  AP  and 
PEG/FEFO  is  actually  negligible.  The  liquid  state  of  the  binder  transforms,  however,  into  the 
solid  state  at  about  300°C.  These  experiments  provide  a  qualitative  concept  of  the  binder  behav¬ 
ior  under  slow  heating.  Remember,  however,  that  in  the  combustion  wave  the  rate  of  temperature 
rise  is  of  3-4  order  of  magnitude  higher.  Thus,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the  binder  behavior  in  solid 
propellant  combustion  and  it  is  necessary  to  perform  special  experiments  on  the  thermal  decom¬ 
position  of  propellant  mixtures  under  fast  heating. 

The  samples  of  propellants  were  burnt  out  in  a  window  bomb  at  21.6  atm  and  in  the  pipe  bomb  at 
25  atm.  The  burning  rates  for  propellants  with  the  inert  binder  were  almost  identical  (ca.  0.8 
cm/s)  and  for  the  propellant  with  the  active  binder  they  were  higher  by  a  factor  of  two.  The  film¬ 
ing  shows  that  the  propellant  with  CTPB  gives  much  smoke.  The  other  propellants  burnt  with 
clear  flame.  An  analysis  of  the  condensed  combustion  products  gave  the  same  value  of  D5o  (88 
pm)  for  both  of  the  propellants  with  the  inert  binder.  However,  for  the  propellant  with  the  active 
binder  D50  was  68  pm.  In  this  case  the  value  of  D50  characterizes  particles  whose  size  exceeds  37 
pm.  The  total  mass  of  these  particles  for  all  three  propellants  was  about  5%  of  the  total  mass  of 
precipitated  particles.  The  5-37  pm  particles  amounted  to  7-8%  of  the  mass  of  the  condensed 
residue  for  the  propellants  containing  CTPB  and  active  binder  and  for  the  propellants  with  the 
TPE-binder  their  fraction  was  12.5%.  The  data  on  the  size-distribution  of  fine  particles  were  used 
to  estimate  the  damping  rates  of  sound  oscillations  in  the  combustion  chamber.  Conclusion  has 
been  drawn  on  a  considerable  influence  of  the  binder  on  the  character  of  metallized  propellant 
burning.  However,  it  is  rather  problematic  to  use  the  results  of  a  given  paper  for  future  estima¬ 
tions  because  there  is  no  data  on  size  distribution  of  components  as  well  as  for  the  completeness 
of  aluminum  burning-out  in  agglomerates. 

Since  it  is  difficult  to  interpret  the  multi-factor  experiment  on  metal  agglomeration,  it  is  necessary 
to  perform  experiment  under  rigidly  characterized  and  fixed  conditions.  Such  an  attempt  was 
made  in  [69,70],  where  the  samples  of  solid  propellants  with  variable  composition  were  prepared 
using  heterogeneous  components  of  the  same  size,  which  resulted  in  a  similar  geometrical  struc¬ 
ture  of  the  propellant.  The  burning  velocity  was  also  equalized  by  means  of  catalysts.  In  this  case, 
the  initial  aim  was  reached,  i.e.  the  equal  capacity  of  the  binder  "pockets",  filled  with  metal,  and 
the  similar  residence  times  in  the  surface  propellant  layer.  The  model  propellants  contained  17- 
20%  of  A1  powder  with  particle  size  of  5-30  pm,  pure  AP,  and  AP+HMX  mixture,  inert  and  ac¬ 
tive  binders.  The  samples  were  burnt  out  in  a  flow  bomb  with  the  downward  directed  flame.  The 
condensed  combustion  products  were  collected  in  the  lower  part  of  the  bomb  using  metallic  grids 
stack  and  aerosol  filter  (the  minimum  captured  particle  size  being  0.5  pm).  The  products  were 
then  analyzed  by  their  sizes  and  by  the  content  of  active  aluminum. 

The  high-speed  movie  was  performed  for  propellants,  burning  at  atmospheric  pressure  under 
backlit  illumination.  Obviously,  the  behavior  of  metallic  particle  aggregates  depends  on  the  pro¬ 
pellant  type.  In  the  poorly  agglomerating  propellants  the  formation  of  particle  filigrees  on  the 
burning  surface  is  followed  by  ignition  of  the  top  and  by  coalescence  of  particles  into  a  large 
droplet.  For  the  strongly  agglomerating  propellants  the  particle  coalescence  and  ignition  occur 
within  the  limits  of  the  surface  layer.  Besides,  the  intermediate  case  may  be  realized  where  the 
separating  nonbuming  aggregate  coalesces  into  a  droplet  at  a  comparatively  large  distance  from 


5—26 


the  burning  surface  and  is  ignited  to  form  a  closed  aureole  which  is  then  destroyed  and  trans¬ 
forms  into  a  typical  "smoke"  tail.  It  is  assumed  then  that  the  closed  aureole  corresponds  to  a  thin 
liquid  oxide  coating,  existing  during  a  short  period  of  time  and  which  is  difficult  to  shoot.  An  ex¬ 
act  explanation  of  this  phenomenon  is  still  unavailable. 


Fig.  5.7.  Relative  content  of  unbumed  A1  in  condensed  combustion  products 
vs.  pressure  for  AP-based  propellants  with  different  binders. 

Treating  the  data  on  aluminum  combustion  efficiency  in  the  flame  with  varying  pressure  from  1 
to  80  atm,  the  following  three  conclusions  have  been  drawn: 

l.A  rise  in  pressure  is  followed  not  only  by  a  typical  tendency  to  an  increase  in  the  completeness 
of  metal  burning-out  (propellants  II  and  E2)  but  also  by  a  tendency  to  the  conservation  of  a  high 
degree  of  combustion  incompleteness  (propellants  12  and  El).  The  latter  may  be  attributed  to  the 
effective  metal  capsulation  by  oxide.  However,  the  reasons  for  this  change  in  the  agglomerate 
structure  are  still  unknown.  Note  that  the  experiments  were  carried  out  under  the  weak  argon 
blowing  of  propellants,  and  the  metal  was  extinguished  after  mixing  with  inert  gas.  It  is  not  yet 
validated  to  apply  these  results  to  the  conditions  of  a  rocket  motor.  They,  however,  demonstrate 
an  important  feature  of  the  initial  phase  of  agglomerate  motion  in  the  flame,  which  should  be 
taken  into  account  in  mathematical  models.

2.  The  phenomenon  of  capsulation  is  observed  upon  propellant  combustion  with  both  inert  and 
active  binders.  Thus,  a  high  reactivity  of  the  binder  fails  to  provide  a  high  efficiency  of  metal 
burning-out. 

3.  A  comparison  between  inert  binders  shows  substantial  difference  in  the  influence  on  the  com¬ 
pleteness  of  metal  combustion,  i.e.  at  high  pressures  polybutadiene  provides  better  efficiency  of 
A1  combustion  than  isoprene.  Additional  information  is  necessary  about  the  thermal  destruction 
and  the  adhesion  properties  of  binders  at  high  temperatures  to  interpret  these  facts. 

The  data  on  particle  sizes  and  a  relative  content  of  a  coarse  fraction  are  in  agreement  with  the 
above  tendencies  in  metal  combustion  efficiency.  Note  that  the  fine  particles  (less  than  30-50  m) 
contain,  as  a  rule,  not  more  than  1%  of  pure  metal  whereas  the  coarse  ones  contain  up  to  20-30% 
(in  the  capsulated  agglomerates).  It  turns  out  that  for  the  weakly  agglomerating  propellants  II,  E2 
the  fraction  of  fine  particles  in  the  total  mass  of  condensed  residues  varies  from  80  to  98%  and 
for  the  strongly  agglomerating  particles  it  amounts  only  to  45-65%. 

5.3.2.  The  burning  time  of  agglomerates. 

As  has  been  mentioned,  the  burning  time  of  single  aluminum  particles  in  oxygen-containing  me¬ 
dia  depends  on  the  diameter  to  the  first  power  for  fine  and  to  the  second  power  for  coarse  initial 
particles.  The  question  of  agglomerate  combustion  law  has  been  studied  to  a  smaller  degree  but 
we  may  give  some  recommended  correlations.  The  empirical  relationship  below 

Tb  =  const  D7am 

is  used  in  most  published  papers.  In  this  case,  tb  is  the  time  of  particle  burning;  D  is  the  diameter 
of  the  initial  particle;  a  is  the  mole  fraction  of  oxidizing  components  in  the  gas  medium.  Earlier  it 
was  assumed  that  the  main  oxidizing  reagents  in  the  combustion  products  of  solid  propellants, 
H20  and  C02,  act  equivalently,  and  a  equals  the  arithmetic  sum  of  their  mole  fractions.  Accord¬ 
ing  to  [2,4],  m=0.9  whereas  n=1.5  [2]  and  n=1.75  [4].  A  more  complex  expression  for  the  burn¬ 
ing  time  of  agglomerates  in  the  rocket  motor  chamber  has  been  derived  in  [71] 

tb  =  const  D18/RcPa27a0'9, 

where  Rc  is  the  matching  coefficient,  taking  into  account  the  difference  between  the  burning  con¬ 
ditions  in  the  rocket  motor  chamber  and  in  the  bomb;  P  is  the  pressure  in  the  chamber.  Note  that 
the  minor  differences  in  the  calculation  formulas  may  result  from  the  differences  in  experimental 
conditions,  initial  components,  and  the  methods  of  treatment  of  experimental  data. 

5.3.3.  Mathematical  modeling  of  agglomeration. 

A  complete  model  of  metal  agglomeration  in  the  combustion  wave  of  solid  propellants  must  de¬ 
scribe  a  sequence  of  stages  beginning  in  the  surface  layer  and  continuing  on  the  burning  surface. 
It  is  necessary  to  consider  the  processes  of  metallic  particle  heating,  the  formation  of  a  primary 
contact,  coalescence,  partial  reacting  and  ignition.  Attempts  to  create  agglomeration  models  have 
being  under  way  from  the  60s. 

One  of  the  first  models  [54]  is  based  on  the  idea  of  collision  and  coalescence  of  the  melted  me¬ 
tallic  particles  on  the  burning  surface.  The  model  assumes  that  the  residence  time  of  a  particle  on 


5—28 


the  burning  surface  is  equal  to  the  time  necessary  for  the  wave  to  cover  the  distance  equal  to  the 
metallic  particle  diameter.  Expressions  have  been  obtained  for  the  critical  size  of  metallic  parti¬ 
cles.  The  particles  of  this  size  tend  to  agglomeration.  The  model,  however,  fails  to  predict  both 
upper  limit  size  of  agglomerated  particles  and  the  size  of  agglomerates. 

Another  model  has  been  proposed  [72]  that  is  based  on  the  idea  of  metallic  particle  accumulation 
in  the  liquid-viscous  surface  layer  due  to  surface  tension.  The  excess  of  particle  ignition  time 
over  the  time  of  particle  accumulation  (complete  filling  of  the  liquid-viscous  layer)  is  taken  as  a 
criterion  for  agglomeration.  Thus,  if  the  metallic  particle  is  ignited  faster  than  the  layer  is  filled, 
agglomeration  fails:  the  particle  is  ejected  into  the  gas  phase. 

A  detailed  model  of  agglomeration  as  applied  to  the  highly  metallized  two-component  mixtures 
with  a  melting  oxidizer  has  been  developed  in  [73,74],  The  time  of  agglomeration  has  been  esti¬ 
mated  as  a  sum  of  the  times  of  contact  and  of  complete  particle  coalescence.  Special  experiments 
on  coalescence  under  isothermal  conditions  show  that  the  coalescence  of  particles  obeys  the  law 
below 


(x/2R)n  =  tK(T)/Rm, 

where  x  is  the  radius  of  contact  surface  between  particles  with  radius  R;  K(T)  is  a  power  function 
of  temperature;  t  is  the  time.  The  indices  n  and  m  depend  on  the  mechanism  of  sintering.  In  the 
case  of  surface  diffusion  for  aluminum  n=8  and  m=4  and  for  magnesium  n=7.2  and  m=4.8.  For  a 
viscous  flow  for  A1  n=1.4  and  m=l,  and  for  Mg  n=1.9  and  m=l.l. 

It  is  interesting  that  during  A1  sintering  the  process  in  the  initial  stage  first  follows  the  mechanism 
of  surface  diffusion  and  then  the  mechanism  of  viscous  flow.  The  final  stage  follows  the  mecha¬ 
nism  of  volume  diffusion  (n=4.6  and  m=3).  The  time  of  Mg  particle  sintering  is  1000-fold  longer 
than  that  of  A1  particle  sintering.  For  magnesium  the  sintering  first  follows  the  mechanism  of  vis¬ 
cous  flow  and  then  the  mechanism  of  surface  diffusion.  If  sintering  occurs  in  the  active  medium, 
e.g.  in  the  air,  the  local  inflammation  of  magnesium  is  realized  at  a  fairly  high  substrate  tem¬ 
perature  in  the  zone  of  a  contact  "neck".  Thereafter  the  flame  spreads  over  the  particles. 

The  model  [74]  gives  a  qualitatively  correct  explanation  of  the  experimentally  observed  depend¬ 
encies,  e.g.  the  existence  of  a  minimum  in  the  curves  of  the  dependence  of  the  enlargement  de¬ 
gree  of  initial  metallic  particle  size  on  pressure  with  varying  initial  particle  size  and  on  the  rela¬ 
tive  density  of  the  pressed  sample.  The  model  predicts  the  ranges  of  parameters  (surface  tension 
of  liquid  surface  layer,  particle  size,  the  velocity  of  gas  flow  from  the  surface)  in  which  either  the 
initial  metallic  particles  or  the  particle  agglomerates  are  dispersed  or  the  carcass  is  formed  after 
sample  bum  out. 

A  relatively  simple  model  of  A1  agglomeration  upon  combustion  of  conventional  (up  to  20%) 
solid  propellants  is  proposed  in  [75].  The  model  is  based  on  the  qualitative  concepts  of  a  geomet¬ 
rical  structure  of  composite  propellants,  characterized  by  the  binder  "pockets"  filled  with  metallic 
particles  [53].  The  problem  reduces  to  the  determination  of  the  "effective  pocket"  determined  as  a 
local  minimum  volume  in  which  the  A1  "capsulation"  by  AP  particles  is  reached  and  the  flame 
temperature  exceeds  that  of  aluminum  inflammation.  It  is  assumed  that  at  lower  flame  tempera- 


5—29 


tures,  aluminum  cannot  be  ignited  and  leaves  the  burning  surface.  According  to  [75],  a  tempera¬ 
ture  of  1400  K  is  taken  as  that  of  aluminum  inflammation  in  the  gaseous  combustion  products  of 
solid  propellants.  It  is  interesting  that  calculations  for  model  propellants  based  on  polybutadiene 
binder  (10%  of  weight),  A1  (20%  of  weight)  and  AP  (70%  of  weight)  show  a  substantial  depend¬ 
ence  of  flame  temperature  on  the  particle  size  of  a  fine  AP  fraction.  It  was  assumed  then  that  AP 
consists  of  three  fractions:  fine,  medium,  and  coarse  in  a  1:6:3  ratio.  The  flame  temperature  rises 
from  1250K  to  2000K  with  varying  size  of  fine  particles  from  5  to  100  pm.  Accordingly,  a  tem¬ 
perature  of  1400K  is  realized  only  for  the  mixtures  with  fine  AP  particles  large  than  50  pm  in 
size.  Thus,  actually,  leads  to  the  formation  of  fairly  large  agglomerates  despite  the  existence  of 
fine  AP  particles  in  solid  propellants.  The  calculated  results  are  in  fair  agreement  with  the  avail¬ 
able  experimental  data.  It  was  recommended  to  reduce  the  agglomeration  intensity  in  propellants 
with  a  three-model  oxidizer  by  increasing  the  concentration  of  medium  AP  particles. 

Attempts  were  made  [76]  to  give  in  detail  the  agglomeration  model  to  take  into  account  the  influ¬ 
ence  of  pressure  and  of  the  physicochemical  parameters  of  propellant  components.  It  is  assumed 
that  the  ensemble  of  initial  metallic  particles  within  the  elementary  cell  (pocket)  melts  on  the 
burning  surface  and  coalesces  into  a  single  droplet  that  may  move  over  the  surface  due  to  the 
nonuniform  gas  flow.  The  coalescence  of  single  metallic  droplets  is  accompanied  by  their  heating 
by  flame  due  to  the  heat  release  of  heterogeneous  oxidation  reactions.  Agglomerates  are  ignited 
instantaneously  when  the  critical  temperature  is  reached.  As  a  result,  the  connection  with  the 
burning  surface  is  failed  and  the  agglomerate  is  carried  out  by  the  gas  flow.  The  critical  tem¬ 
perature  and  size  of  the  forming  agglomerate  are  calculated  from  the  equations  of  heat  balance 
and  by  the  chemical  reaction  for  a  reacting  metallic  droplet.  The  agglomerate  heat  exchange  with 
the  gas  phase  on  the  burning  surface  is  calculated  by  solving  the  additional  problem  on  the  diffu¬ 
sion  flame  of  oxidizer  and  binder  decomposition  products.  Giving  the  reasonable  values  for  ki¬ 
netic  and  thermophysical  parameters,  the  calculations  in  terms  of  model  [76]  give  the  results  that 
are  in  qualitative  agreement  with  available  experimental  data.  In  particular,  the  increasing  de¬ 
pendence  of  the  median  agglomerate  size  on  the  oxidizer  particle  size  is  well  reproduced  for 
P=20  atm  [77], 

It  is  shown  that  the  characteristic  agglomerate  size  may  both  decrease  and  increase  with  varying 
both  the  constants  of  the  global  chemical  reaction  in  the  gas  flame  and  the  mass  oxidizer  fraction 
in  the  propellant,  and  may  even  display  a  maximum  with  rising  pressure  as  verified  by  some  ex¬ 
periments.  In  this  case,  the  flame  temperature  and  the  dependence  of  burning  rate  on  pressure 
vary  within  a  wide  range  that  causes  large  variations  in  the  intensity  of  heat  exchange  with  ag¬ 
glomerate  on  the  burning  surface.  Agglomeration  increases  with  either  growing  distance  of  flame 
stand  off  or  dropping  flame  temperature. 

It  is  correctly  reasoned  [76]  that  the  hypothesis  of  separation  of  the  ignited  A1  particles  from  the 
burning  surface  which  is  a  basis  of  the  model,  fails  for  the  combustion  of  propellants  with  a  low 
temperature  of  either  flame  or  burning  surface.  Besides,  a  quantitative  use  of  the  model  [76]  as¬ 
sumes  a  reliable  knowledge  of  a  great  body  of  kinetic  and  thermophysical  parameters  which  is 
now  impossible.  Thus,  actual  is  one  of  the  first  calculation  models  of  metal  agglomeration  [78] 
based  on  the  analysis  of  the  geometrical  structure  of  heterogeneous  propellants.  This  "pocket 
model"  suggests  that  the  temperature-time  conditions  in  the  combustion  wave  of  solid  propellants 
provide,  in  most  cases,  the  sintering  and  subsequent  melting  of  metallic  particles  on  the  burning 


5—30 


surface.  Further  behavior  of  the  resulting  aggregate  of  particles  in  the  model  is  neglected.  The 
conditions  for  agglomerate  ignition  are  indirectly  assumed  to  be  fulfilled.  Therefore  the  calcu¬ 
lated  values  of  agglomerates  should  be  considered  as  predicted  with  all  conditions  satisfied.  The 
contacts  between  metallic  particles  in  the  «pocket»,  consisting  of  the  coarse  oxidizer  particles,  are 
considered  necessary  for  agglomeration. 

It  might  be  easily  shown  on  the  basis  of  geometrical  considerations  that  when  the  volume  content 
of  metal  in  the  pocket  is  20%  and  more,  which  is  typical  of  conventional  solid  propellants,  the 
number  of  contacts  per  one  metallic  particle  exceeds  1.6.  This  stimulates  the  formation  of  the  in¬ 
finitely  long  chain  of  contacting  metallic  particles  and  creates  the  necessary  condition  for  the 
sintering  of  metallic  particles  ensemble.  Further,  using  stereology,  the  effective  pocket  size  D  is 
calculated  and  the  expected  agglomerate  size  is  estimated  using  the  formula 

Dag  =  (P1/3)D, 

where  (3  corresponds  to  the  volume  content  of  aluminum  in  the  "pocket".  Thus 

P  =  (M(l  -  XfU'1 , 

where  (3Ai  and  Xpox  are  the  aluminum  and  oxidizer  volume  fractions  in  solid  propellants.  The  ef¬ 
fective  size  D  is  calculated  from  the  relationship  below 

D  =  4(1  -  Pox)/S0x,  Sox  =  (6/Dox)(Pox  -  l)ln(l  -  Pox), 

where  Pox  and  Sox  are  the  volume  fraction  and  specific  surface  of  coarse  oxidizer  particles  in  the 
propellant,  Dox  is  the  mean  size  of  coarse  oxidizer  particles. 

The  theoretical  concepts  of  [78]  were  used  to  analyze  the  results  of  a  study  of  agglomeration 
upon  combustion  of  the  pressed  pyrotechnic  metal-oxidizer  mixtures  [63].  In  this  case,  the  metal 
first  fills  the  empty  gaps  between  oxidizer  grains  and  then  is  pressed.  The  mass  fraction  of  metal 
e  in  the  mixture  (the  oxidizer  fraction  being  1-e)  and  the  free  packed  mixture  pf  are  known.  Using 
these  values,  the  expression  for  calculating  the  mean-volume  agglomerate  diameter  has  the  form 

Dag  =  2/3  -Dox  [  pMe/  (Pox- 1 )]  1/3/ln(  1  -  Pox)  (5-2) 

Here  pMe  =  £  Pf/  PMe,  Pox  =  (l-e)Pf/pox.  This  formula  gives  the  value  of  Dag=140  pm  and  the  ex¬ 
perimentally  determined  value  turns  out  125  pm. 

The  existence  of  AP  fine  and  coarse  fractions  at  a  time  leads  to  the  widening  of  the  size  distribu¬ 
tion  function  of  agglomerates  with  a  weak  effect  on  the  value  of  the  predicted  effective  agglom¬ 
erate  size.  Let  us  give  some  results  of  such  calculations  [79].  The  bimodal  system  of  the  oxidizer 
particles  can  be  characterized  by  the  mean  size  D  and  mean  free  distance  l  -  R-  D  between  the 
particles,  where  R  -  mean  distance  between  centers  of  particles. 

Let  us  assume  further  that  the  particles  are  distributed  in  the  volume  according  to  the  Poisson 
law.  Then  calculation  according  to  the  formula 


gives  value  of  mathematical  expectation  E  of  the  size  of  agglomerate.  Here

Comparison  of  the  numerical  values  of  the  coefficients  En  and  (2/3)/ln(l-P0x)  in  formulas  (5.2) 
and  (5.3)  at  D3  /(d  =  l),  i.e.  for  monodisperse  oxidizer,  has  shown  [79]  that  the  difference  be¬ 
tween  coefficients  equals  18%  at  POX=0.33  and  only  6%  at  pox=0.37.  Consequently,  approximate 
formula  (5.3)  with  reasonable  accuracy  makes  it  possible  to  calculate  average  distances  between 
the  particles. 

It  has  to  be  underlined  that  the  model  examined  is  based  on  substantially  simplified  picture  of  the 
phenomenon  of  agglomeration.  One  of  the  basic  assumptions  of  the  model  is  the  possibility  of 
isolation  (conditional)  in  the  uninterrupted  binder  matrix  of  the  cell  with  the  assigned  content  of 
powder-like  metal.  It  is  difficult  to  justify  by  any  theoretical  method  this  assumption.  Thereby  it 
was  important  to  compare  the  results  of  calculations  with  the  data  of  experimental  observations 
[79]  made  in  combustion  of  the  model  SP,  which  contained  the  particles  of  aluminum  with  the 
size  of  5-50  Jim  and  ammonium  perchlorate  with  the  size  of  100-300  |im.  It  followed  from  these 
observations  that  the  formation  of  agglomerates  in  many  instances  was  preceded  with  the  appear¬ 
ance  on  the  burning  surface  of  aggregates  consisted  of  partially  sintered  particles.  During  certain 
residence  time  on  the  surface  the  aggregates  melted  and  merge  into  the  drop  of  liquid  metal.  Only 
rarely  individual  aggregates  ejected  into  the  gas  phase,  without  having  been  completely  fused. 
With  pressure  increase  these  events  could  proceed  within  the  limits  of  the  reaction  layer  of  con¬ 
densed  phase.  In  this  case,  as  a  rule,  the  already  formed  agglomerates  appeared  at  the  burning 
surface,  whose  ignition  occurred  in  the  limits  of  the  condensed  phase. 

In  the  case  when  SP  contains  the  oxidizer  and  metal  particles  identical  with  respect  to  sizes,  the 
residence  time  of  metal  on  the  burning  surface  proves  to  be  insufficient.  The  non-ignited  particles 
are  ejected  from  the  surface  and  ignited  at  comparatively  large  distances  downstream.  The  de¬ 
tailed  comparison  of  the  expected  sizes  of  agglomerates  with  those  recorded  in  experiments  with 
the  model  propellants  showed  rather  fair  efficiency  of  the  model  proposed  and  calculation 
method. 

Experiments  were  conducted  at  atmospheric  pressure  with  the  specially  prepared  samples  of  SP, 
which  contained  the  narrow  fractions  of  oxidizer.  The  measurement  of  the  sizes  of  agglomerates 
ejected  from  the  burning  surface  was  conducted  by  high-speed  macro  cinematography  method 
with  the  intense  pulse  back  illumination.

The  sizes  of  the  particles  of  the  metal  varied  in  these  experiments  from  5  to  50  pm,  the  polybuta¬ 
diene  type  binder  has  been  used.  As  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  5.8,  with  variation  in  the  size  of  the 
oxidizer  particles  from  100  to  300  pm  the  disagreement  of  experimental  and  theoretical  results 
does  not  exceed  10-15%. 

5.4.  EFFECT  OF  AL  ON  THE  BURNING  RATE  OF  A  SOLID  PROPELLANT. 

5.4.1.  Mathematical  modeling  of  the  combustion  of  metallized  solid  propellant. 

In  Ref.  [52]  a  vast  experimental  material  has  been  reported,  from  which  it  was  evident  that  addi¬ 
tion  of  aluminum  powder  can  both  increase  and  decrease  the  burning  rate  of  SP.  Two  approxi¬ 
mate  analytical  combustion  models  have  been  formulated  in  Russia  [80,  81]  for  two-component 
system  with  easily  gasified  oxidizer  and  hardly  gasified  fuel.  The  former  is  randomly  distributed 
in  disperse  form  throughout  the  system.  The  models  were  intended  for  describing  the  combustion 
of  a  black  powder,  but  with  some  stipulations  they  can  be  applied  to  the  metallized  compositions 
simulation.  By  analogy  with  the  combustion  model  for  volatile  monopropellant  a  quasi- 
homogeneous  model  with  the  rate  control  stage  in  the  smoke-gas  phase  was  examined.  Under  the 
assumption  about  the  diffusion  combustion  regime  of  ejected  from  the  surface  particles  the  fol¬ 
lowing  expression  for  volume  heat  evolution  rate  d>  in  the  smoke-gas  mixture  can  be  written: 
<J>~s  |  VC  | ,  where  s~p/d  -  specific  (per  unit  volume  of  mixture)  area  of  the  particles;  I  VC  I  ~l/d  - 
concentration  gradient  of  oxidizer  near  the  particle;  P  -  pressure  and  d  -  particle  size.  Then 

V/d  (5-4) 

If  in  the  zone  of  maximum  heat  evolution  the  particles  become  detached  from  the  gas,  it  is  ful¬ 
filled  m  ~  p1/3/d.  The  above  relationships  can  be  modified  in  the  case  of  combustion  of  SP  with 
addition  of  aluminum.  When  taking  into  account  an  intrinsic  heat  evolution  Oo  of  the  gaseous 
flame,  one  obtains

Here  mo  -  burning  rate  of  metal-free  composition.  An  expression  of  such  type  first  was  obtained 
in  Ref.  [82].  Specifically,  it  was  made  with  taking  into  consideration  a  possibility  of  the  existence 
of  different  temperatures  for  particles  and  surrounding  gas,  so  that  the  result  of  [82]  had  the  form 

I  l-2vn 

m/m0  ~yA+Bp  ,  A  =  const,  B  =  const  (5.5) 

It  was  reported  [52,  82]  that  qualitatively  expression  (5.5)  agreed  well  with  the  experiment:  with 
vo<0.5  the  ratio  of  m/mo  has  positive  dependence  on  the  pressure,  and  with  Vo>0.5  -  negative.  It 
should  be  noted  that  upon  derivation  of  (5.5),  as  in  (5.4),  the  assumptions  about  the  rate  control 
role  of  smoke-gas  zone  and  about  the  quasi-homogeneity  of  the  combustion  model  have  been 
actually  used. 


More  detailed  combustion  model  for  aluminized  SP  without  fixing  the  rate  control  stage  was  de¬ 
veloped  in  Ref.  [57].  The  model  effectively  used  the  concepts  of  “petite  ensemble”  approach  (see 
Section  3.3.3).  There  were  considered  melting  the  particles  of  aluminum,  their  motion  in  the 
flame,  ignition,  combustion  and  heat  supply  from  the  combustion  zone  of  metal  to  the  propellant 
surface.  Calculated  burning  rate  and  the  pressure  exponent  for  SP  with  aluminum  and  without  it 
was  compared  with  reported  in  Ref.  [57]  Miller’s  experimental  data.  The  experiments  have  been 
carried  out  at  p=68  atm  for  25  SP  formulations,  which  contained  in  the  different  ratios  eight  AP 
fractions.  The  numerous  parameters,  entering  the  “petite  ensemble”  model  (for  SP  without 
metal),  were  selected  for  the  best  agreement  with  experiments,  and  then  were  used  without 
change  in  the  model  taking  into  account  aluminum.  Thus,  the  complication  of  the  model  did  not 
involve  the  appearance  of  new  floating  coefficients.  Since  in  the  majority  of  experiments  the  ef¬ 
fect  of  aluminum  on  the  value  of  the  burning  rate  turned  out  to  be  negative  (metal  acted  only  as 
heat-sink  in  the  condensed  phase),  for  the  application  the  simplified  version  of  the  model  was 
proposed  which  did  not  take  into  account  the  combustion  of  aluminum. 

It  was  assumed  that  each  pseudo-propellant  (part  of  SP,  which  contains  one  narrow  fraction  of 
oxidizer)  contains  the  same  mass  fraction  of  aluminum  as  entire  propellant.  The  balance  of  heat 
for  the  pseudo-propellant  takes  the  form: 

c(T,-7-0)=p,ePF«'w-aeI-(i-a-p)e/  + 
a(l  -  P,  )(eFF«H"  +  QAFe-i" )  -  pa*,  -  pc*  (t,  -  t.  ) 

Designations  are  the  same  as  in  the  BDP  model  presented  earlier  (Section  3.3.2).  Additionally, 
here  entered:  (3  -  mass  fraction  of  aluminum  in  propellant;  QmAi  -  heat  of  A1  melting.  The  right 
hand  side  in  (5.6)  takes  into  consideration  also  the  heat  consumed  for  melting  of  metal  and  heat¬ 
ing  of  ejected  particles  from  Ts  to  Tf.  The  size  of  the  particles  of  the  metal  is  not  considered. 

Heat  balance  (5.6)  does  not  include  yet  the  term  (see  below  (5.12))  responsible  for  the  heat  feed¬ 
back  to  the  SP  surface  from  metallic  particles  burning  in  the  gas  flow.  All  the  ejected  A1  particles 
according  to  the  model  are  of  the  same  size,  i.e.  agglomeration  is  not  considered.  It  is  assumed 
that  on  the  SP  surface  the  particles  have  a  temperature  close  to  Ts  and  after  detachment  from  the 
surface  they  are  ignited  after  time  tign,  according  to  [2]

It  is  similar  to  that  given  in  [2].  With  known  size  DAi(t)  one  may  calculate  rate  of  change  in  the

supplemented  to  the  right  hand  side  of  (5.6)  that  considers  the  heat  feedback  from  the  combustion 
of  metal  in  the  flame  must  take  form  QAi  n,  where  QAi  is  calculated  by  (5.12)  and  n  -  number  of 
particles  of  the  metal  in  the  mass  unit  of  SP,  n=p/(pAi7tD3Ai>0/6).  Let  us  note  that  upon  taking  into 
consideration  the  A1  agglomeration  (i.e.,  the  fact  that  the  SP  surface  generates  metal  particles  of 
the  amalgamated  sizes}  instead  of  product  QAi  n  one  has  to  compute  the  corresponding  integral. 


Results  of  calculations  [82]  showed  that  the  heat  feedback  from  burning  aluminum  to  the  propel¬ 
lant  is  noticeable,  if  combustion  occurs  within  the  zone  with  £=xcm/A,g  <1,  i.e.,  at  small  distance 
from  the  surface.  This  is  realized  with  the  small  sizes  of  particles  ejected  from  the  surface  and  at 
the  low  burning  rate  of  SP  (for  example,  for  the  pseudo-propellant  with  the  coarse  oxidizer).  The 
calculated  dependence  of  the  thermal  contribution  of  aluminum  on  the  size  of  the  oxidizer  parti-

cles  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.9,  in  terms  of  the  portions  of  different  flames  in  the  overall  heat  flux  to  the 
burning  surface.

densed  phase  vs  the  oxidizer  grain  size.  [82]. 

Comparison  with  Miller’s  experiments  showed  that  the  model  with  heat-sink  (without  taking  into 
account  the  combustion  of  particles)  overestimates  the  burning  rate  for  compositions,  which 
contain  simultaneously  coarse  and  fine  AP  fractions,  and  somewhat  underestimates  it  for  formu¬ 
lations,  which  contain  only  coarse  and  medium  AP  fractions.  For  the  latter  formulation  the  cal¬ 
culations  with  taking  into  account  contribution  from  the  burning  A1  particles  gave  better  agree¬ 
ment  with  experiment. 

5.4.2.  Discussion  of  the  metal  combustion  models. 

Actually,  the  models  presented  contain  elements  that  require  refinement  or  modifications.  The 
validity  of  assumption  about  uniform  distribution  of  aluminum  among  pseudo-propellants  [57] 
(for  each  of  them  the  mass  fraction  of  metal  is  the  same  as  for  entire  propellant)  causes  doubt.  It 
would  be  more  natural  to  consider  aluminum  as  distributed  evenly  over  the  binder,  whereas  the 
binder  between  the  pseudo-propellants  is  distributed  unevenly  [83,  84]. 

Such  considerations  find  confirmation  in  experimental  data  [57]  for  SP,  which  contained  only 
extreme  size  AP  particles:  coarse  (400pm)  and  fine  (0.7;  2;  6  pm).  The  calculations  predicted  a 
comparatively  small  decrease  in  the  burning  rate  due  to  introduction  of  the  metal.  For  SP  with 
overall  content  of  AP  decreased  from  88  to  70%,  the  introduction  of  18%  of  aluminum  with  the 
particle  size  of  6  pm,  as  expected  by  calculations,  had  to  lower  the  burning  rate  from  20-23  to  15- 
17  mm/s.  In  the  experiment,  the  burning  rate  reduced  to  ~8  mm/s.  This  significant  decrease  can 
be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  particles  of  metal  were  localized  in  the  gaps  between  the  AP 
particles  of  fraction  400  pm  and  served  as  heat-sink  for  located  there  small  particles  of  AP  with 
size  of  0.7;  2  and  6  pm,  which  in  the  absence  of  aluminum  provided  high  burning  rate  of  these 
SP.  Obviously,  the  agreement  with  experiment  for  these  compositions  can  be  improved,  if  one 
considers  the  metal  distributed  evenly  over  the  binder.  In  this  case  the  related  to  fine  AP  fractions 
amount  of  binder  will  turn  out  larger  than  for  coarse  AP  fraction. 

Apparently,  additional  investigations  are  needed  on  ignition  of  A1  particles  in  the  flame  of  SP.  It 
is  clear  that  the  combustion  of  metal  would  affect  the  burning  rate  of  propellant  only  in  the  case 


5—36 


when  the  noticeable  portion  of  heat  from  the  burning  aluminum  particles  returns  on  the  burning 
surface.  This  means  that  the  distance  to  the  flame  of  metal  must  be  of  the  same  order  of  magni¬ 
tude  as  the  distances  of  other  flames  from  the  burning  surface.  But  in  this  case  heating  of  alumi¬ 
num  up  to  its  ignition  proceeds  in  the  gas  flame  with  the  high  temperature  gradient.  Its  value  does 
not  enter  into  formula  (5.7),  obtained  by  processing  the  experiment  on  the  combustion  of  tablets 
of  aluminized  SP  [2]. 

Further,  it  looks  unjustified  an  inclusion  in  the  heat  balance  (5.6)  of  term  for  taking  account  of 
heating  the  A1  particle  from  Ts  to  Tf.  Note  that  (5.6)  has  the  meaning  of  heat  supply  and  con¬ 
sumption  on  the  surface.  However,  the  heat  balance  (5.6)  is  written  in  such  a  way,  as  if  metal  on 
the  surface,  which  has  mean  temperature  Ts,  reaches  temperature  Tf.  This  statement  could  not  be 
accepted  completely.  Actually,  liquid  A1  particles  in  the  f  lame  are  heated  by  gas,  and  this  can  be 
taken  into  account,  for  example,  by  the  decrease  in  thermal  effects  Qpf,  Qff,  Qap  or  by  an  in¬ 
crease  in  distances  £PF,  Cff,  Cap-  Authors  of  [57]  reported  about  the  inclusion  of  expenditures  for 
heating  of  metal  in  expressions  for  QPF,  Qff,  Qap  but  details  of  that  were  not  given.  Therefore  the 
retention  of  term  PaiCTV  -  Ts)  in  (5.6)  causes  a  quandary. 

Let  us  consider  defects  common  for  the  discussed  combustion  models.  In  these  models  the  heat 
evolution  due  to  the  heterogeneous  oxidation  of  the  metal  in  the  condensed  phase,  where  about  3- 
4%  of  aluminum  is  consumed  [52],  is  not  included.  In  addition,  there  is  not  given  background  for 
the  assumption  on  quasi-homogeneity  of  the  combustion  zone  of  the  particles  of  metal  in  the  gas 
flow. 

The  last  issue  can  be  discussed  in  more  detail.  In  Refs.  [80-82]  the  burning  rate  is  calculated  by 
the  Zeldovich  formula  for  gas  phase  zone,  i.e.  the  rate  control  role  of  this  zone  and  its  quasi¬ 
homogeneity  are  assumed.  For  model  [57],  which  is  a  model  of  the  BDP  type,  the  heterogeneity 
of  the  gas  phase  can  prove  to  be  unessential,  if  the  rate  control  stage  is  located  in  the  condensed 
phase.  However,  the  BDP  type  model  can  have  the  rate  control  stage  in  the  gas  phase,  e.g.,  under 
low  pressures  where  AP  does  not  bum  independently.  In  such  a  case  the  condition  of  quasi¬ 
homogeneity  becomes  essential  for  formulating  one-dimensional  problem. 

Let  us  estimate  the  size  of  A1  particles  necessary  to  meet  the  condition  of  quasi-homogeneity  of 
the  gas  phase  zone.  From  the  common  physical  considerations  it  can  be  stated  that  the  distance 
between  A1  particles  in  the  gas  has  to  be  smaller  than  the  length  of  the  preheat  zone  Ax  in  the 
gaseous  flame.  In  this  case  one  may  expect  that  the  temperature  distribution  in  the  gas  phase  is 
sufficiently  uniform.  Thus,  the  above  condition  can  be  formulated  in  the  form:  y  <  Ax,  where  y  is 
the  distance  between  A1  particles  in  the  gas  phase.  In  accordance  with  mass  conservation  law  y=8 
pt/Pg,  where  8  -  mean  distance  between  A1  particles  in  the  condensed  phase,  Pb  and  pg  are  the 
binder  and  gas  densities,  respectively.  The  length  of  the  pre  heat  zone  equals 
Ax=Xg  cm,  where  c  -  specific  heat,  and  m  -  mass  burning  rate. 

Similarly  to  how  this  was  done  in  the  “relay  race”  model  (see  Section  3.5.2),  let  us  replace  the 
ratio  of  the  average  dimensions  of  two  components  (here  metal  and  binder)  with  the  ratio  of  their 
volume  fractions  in  the  SP: 

8/Di,=[(l-a-p)/pJ/(p/p„), 


5—37 


where  (3  and  (1-oc-P)  are  the  mass  fractions  of  metal  and  binder  in  SP. 
Finally  estimation  for  DAi  takes  the  form 

D  <£-  L  A 
Al  pAl  1  -  a  -  P  cm 


(5.13) 


Note  that  this  relationship  is  obtained  under  the  assumption  about  localization  of  the  A1  particles 
in  the  binder,  so  that  1-a-P  *  0.  For  the  typical  values  of  the  SP  parameters  pg/pAi~  0.007,  P=0.2, 
a=0.7,  Xg=3  10'4  cal/(cm  s  K),  c=0.3  cal/(g  K),  m=1.5g/(g/cm2s).  According  to  the  condition 
(5.13)  it  is  required  DA)<  10'5  cm  =  0.1pm.  Certainly,  estimation  (5.13)  needs  the  refinement:  it 
should  be  taken  into  account  the  hydrodynamic  lag  of  particles  in  the  gas  flow,  the  possibility  of 
convective  heat  exchange  between  particles  and  gas,  and  the  effect  of  the  transversal  heat  ex¬ 
change  between  particles. 

Discrete  character  of  the  heat  evolution  in  the  gas  phase  makes  it  necessary  to  doubt  validity  of 
expression  (5.12).  Let  us  consider  under  which  assumptions  it  is  possible  to  use  (5.12).  For  this 
one  can  examine  the  model  problem  about  the  heat  transfer  with  8-type  (in  time  and  space)  heat 
evolution  in  uniform  gas  flow,  m  =  const.  The  gas  flow  goes  out  from  the  condensed  phase, 
which  occupies  half-space  with  the  temperature  of  interface  being  Ts  =  const.  It  is  assumed  that 
the  local  flash  in  gas  (8-type  heat  evolution)  does  not  make  disturbances  into  the  flow  hydrody¬ 
namics,  condition  m  =  const  is  retained  everywhere.  Then  it  can  be  shown  that  from  the  total 
amount  of  heat  released  by  flash-type  oxidation  of  the  A1  particle  the  condensed  phase  receives 
portion  of  heat  exp(-cmz*/X),  where  z*  -  distance  of  the  place  of  A1  particle  flash  from  the  burn¬ 
ing  surface  of  SP. 

5.5.  COMBUSTION  OF  AL  IN  A  ROCKET  MOTOR 

The  previous  Sections  were  mainly  devoted  to  the  problems  of  metallic  particle  behavior  under 
heating  in  the  condensed  phase  and  in  the  reactions  in  the  flame,  i.e.  at  distances  not  more  than 
several  centimeters  from  the  burning  surface.  When  these  data  are  applied  to  combustion  condi¬ 
tions  in  a  rocket  motor,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the  scale  factors,  in  particular,  for  the 
motors,  being  several  meters  in  length.  Actually,  the  results  of  laboratory  investigations  may 
serve  the  initial  data  for  mathematical  modeling  of  metal  transformation  into  oxide  particles  in 
the  rocket  motors.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  completeness  of  metal  combustion  and  the  size- 
distribution  of  condensed  product  particles  affect  the  various  characteristics  of  the  rocket  motors, 
i.e.  the  value  of  the  specific  impulse,  nozzle  wear,  combustor  stability,  the  thermal  radiation  from 
the  plume,  environmental  effects. 

It  is  highly  difficult  to  perform  experimental  investigations  inside  rocket  motors.  Some  easier  is 
to  take  measurements  on  motor  plumes.  However,  extrapolation  of  these  results  to  the  area  inside 
the  motor  is  not  easy  task.  Using  several  complementary  methods  for  recording  the  condensed 
phase  parameters,  the  authors  [85]  have  got  important  information  about  the  evolution  of  com¬ 
bustion  products  upon  passage  of  the  two-phase  flow  through  the  micromotor  nozzle.  The  multi- 


5—38 


pie  wavelength  extinction  measurements  were  performed  together  with  the  measurements  of  the 
velocities  and  sizes  of  single  particles.  These  measurements  gave  a  characteristic  particle  diame¬ 
ter  D32  and  the  radiation  absorption  coefficient  for  the  particles.  A  qualitative  information  about 
size  and  geometric  form  of  particles  in  motor  plume  has  been  obtained  by  means  of  SEM  studies 
on  the  precipitate  of  condensed  combustion  products,  collected  on  copper  plates,  exposed  during 
0.5  s  in  the  plume.  The  data  on  the  size  distribution  of  particles  in  the  chamber  and  in  the  motor 
plume  were  obtained  using  Malvern  systems,  measuring  the  forward  scattered  light  from  particles 
with  size  of  0.5  (am  and  larger  near  the  burning  surface,  as  well  as  at  the  nozzle  entrance  and  in 
the  motor  plume.  In  experiments  a  study  was  made  of  the  model  solid  propellants  with  2%  and 
5%  A1  and  standard  propellant  with  16%  A1  used  in  Shuttle  boosters  (14%  polybutadiene  binder, 
69.7%  AP). 

It  is  interesting  that  the  experiments  using  all  three  types  of  propellants  showed  a  similar  form  of 
the  size  distribution  function  of  particles,  obtained  from  measurements  in  the  micromotor  near 
the  nozzle  entrance.  The  bimodal  distribution  was  recorded  with  the  first  mode  within  the  range 
1-4  pm  and  with  the  second  mode  within  the  range  5-8  pm.  A  characteristic  size  D32  calculated 
by  these  distribution  functions  is  in  the  range  4-17  pm  which  testifies  to  the  absence  of  coarse 
particles  (agglomerates)  in  the  combustion  products  at  the  nozzle  entrance.  At  the  same  time, 
measurements  of  the  size  of  condensed  particles  made  in  the  flame  2  cm  above  the  burning  sur¬ 
face  gave  D32=  132  pm  for  the  propellant  with  16%  A1  (Shuttle).  This  size  is  predicted  by  esti¬ 
mates  obtained  from  the  correlation  relationships.  The  200  pm  particles  were  also  recorded. 
However,  there  is  a  mechanism,  which  causes  substantial  decrease  in  particle  size  upon  motion 
from  the  burning  surface  to  the  nozzle.  The  calculated  residence  time  of  agglomerates  in  the  flow 
does  not  exceed  40  ms  and  it  is  hardly  probable  that  they  have  time  to  bum  out  by  90-99%.  It  is 
assumed  then  that  the  coarse  metallic  droplets  may  destroy  under  the  gas  flow  action  although 
this  is  also  hardly  probable  in  the  case  where  the  end  burning  samples  are  used  and  the  Mach 
number  is  substantially  lower  than  unity. 

The  optical  measurements  in  the  micromotor  plume  near  the  nozzle  exit  showed  a  change  in  the 
form  of  the  size  distribution  function  of  particles:  modes  of  1-4  pm  and  5-8  pm  were  observed 
together  with  a  pronounced  mode  between  10-14  pm.  Nevertheless,  the  existence  of  a  great  num¬ 
ber  of  particles  with  sizes  smaller  than  1-2  pm  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the  typical  size  D32  to  2-2.5 
pm.  The  measurements  also  show  that  relatively  coarse  particles  are  localized  at  the  center  line  of 
the  plume  and  the  smaller  ones  (D32=0.2-0.3  pm)  are  observed  in  the  periphery. 

Note  that  all  results  [85]  were  obtained  using  25  cm  long  micromotors  with  the  residence  time  of 
gas  equal  to  30-50  ms.  Actually,  this  is  intermediate  between  the  combustion  in  a  laboratory 
bomb  and  in  the  full-scale  motor.  A  fairly  developed  approach  is  available  for  describing  the  size 
distribution  of  the  condensed  phase  particles  [86].  Calculations  performed  within  the  framework 
of  this  approach  show  that  the  bimodal  size  distribution  of  particles,  recorded  in  the  laboratory 
experiments  on  particle  extinction,  is  sure  to  transform  into  the  monomodal  one  in  the  nozzle  due 
to  collisions  of  coarse  and  fine  particles.  Obviously,  it  is  necessary  to  verify  these  predictions  for 
large  motors.  Actually,  however,  just  few  experiments  were  performed  on  large  motors  because 
of  the  great  technical  difficulties.  Thus,  the  results  of  condensed  phase  investigations  upon  solid 
propellant  combustion  in  the  real  Shuttle  motor  and  in  its  reduced  copy  (18.3%)  are  of  great  in¬ 
terest  [87].  For  the  reference,  we  may  note  that  the  critical  throat  diameter  in  a  micromotor  was 
0.5  cm,  in  the  Shuttle  motor  it  was  136.8  cm  and  in  its  reduced  copy  it  was  25.4  cm. 


5—39 


Known  is  the  empirical  Hermsen  correlation  [88]  widely  used  to  calculate  the  characteristic  size 
D43  of  the  solid  rocket  motor  plume  particulates  at  the  nozzle  exit  plane 

D43(p)  =  3.6304Dt°293[1.0  -  exp(-0.0008163^PcT)] ,  (5.14) 

where  Dt  is  the  critical  nozzle  throat  diameter  in  inches;  tc  is  the  AI2O3  concentration  inside  the 
chamber  in  gmole/100  g;  Pc  is  the  pressure  in  the  chamber  in  psia  per  square  inch;  x  is  the  mean 
residence  time  in  the  chamber  (350  ms  for  Shuttle  motors  and  120  ms  for  its  reduced  copy). 

Formula  (5.14)  exhibits  a  good  agreement  with  numerous  published  data  on  small  and  medium 
size  motors.  Indeed,  the  measurement  results  for  the  size  of  particles  collected  in  the  motor  plume 
of  a  small  Shuttle  copy,  coincide  to  the  accuracy  of  20%  with  calculations  by  formula  (5.14).  The 
predicted  value  of  d43=7.717  pm  was  much  lower  than  the  measured  values  of  d43=8-9  pm.  How¬ 
ever,  due  to  the  absence  of  experimental  data,  this  formula  was  never  tested  for  the  applicability 
under  experimental  conditions  for  gigantic  Shuttle  motors.  Treating  the  measurement  results  for 
the  sizes  of  particles  collected  for  the  first  time  from  the  motor  plume  of  the  Shuttle  rocket  motor 
it  was  shown  that  the  particle  distribution  is  well  described  by  a  unimodal  function  with  d43=13.7- 
11.6  pm.  In  this  case,  it  was  revealed  that  among  4000  particles  only  2-5  ones  are  larger  than  23 
pm.  According  to  X-ray  microanalysis,  the  coarse  particles  have  impurities  of  silicon  and  cal¬ 
cium,  brought  from  the  Earth  by  a  high-temperature  flow.  On  elimination  of  both  the  particles 
larger  than  23  pm  and  all  irregularly-shaped  ones,  the  experimentally  measured  size  appears  to  be 
11.2-11.0  pm  which  is  by  0.4-0.6%  smaller  than  that  calculated  by  the  Hermsen  formula 
(d43=11.7  pm).  These  results  are  assumed  to  be  indirect  evidence  for  the  hypothesis  of  the  colli¬ 
sion  and  coalescence  of  fine  particles  moving  through  the  nozzle  which  leads  to  the  transforma¬ 
tion  of  the  initial  bimodal  particle  size  distribution  in  the  chamber  into  the  monomodal  one  in  the 
nozzle  due  to  substantial  decrease  in  the  fraction  of  fine  particles  (smoke). 

5.6.  CONCLUDING  REMARKS 

As  has  been  already  mentioned,  metals  are  used  as  components  of  solid  propellants  due  to  both 
their  high  heat  release  upon  oxidation  and  their  high  density.  The  thermodynamic  calculations 
show  a  substantial  increase  in  the  specific  impulse  for  metallized  solid  propellants.  In  most  cases, 
however,  the  peculiarities  of  metallic  powders  combustion  are  ignored.  This  regards  to  the  diffi¬ 
culties  of  the  metal  ignition  in  the  combustion  wave  and  to  the  formation  of  large  agglomerates 
with  volume,  being  hundreds  and  thousands  times  larger  that  of  single  particles.  In  fact,  the  real 
combustion  of  metallic  particles  in  the  rocket  motor  chamber  with  finite  dimensions  may  be  in¬ 
complete  (chemical  losses)  and  the  condensed  combustion  products  may  cause  two-phase  losses 
(micron  particles)  and  even  the  formation  of  slag. 

The  aim  of  the  specialists  in  combustion  is  to  study  the  behavior  of  metallic  particles  upon  com¬ 
bustion  to  construct  the  adequate  models  for  calculating  the  characteristics  of  solid  propellant 
performance.  Unfortunately,  at  the  present  time  the  information  about  metallic  particle  behavior 
under  heating  with  a  rate  of  several  hundred  or  thousand  degrees  per  second  in  various  oxidative 
media  is  rather  scarce.  Interesting  results  are  available  for  the  ignition  of  single  particles  under 
laser  radiation  in  a  purely  gaseous  medium.  However,  there  is  no  sense  in  applying  directly  these 


5 — 40 


results  to  the  conditions  of  metal  ignition  on  solid  propellant  surface  because  the  time  and  tem¬ 
perature  conditions  are  quite  different. 

Note  that  most  problems  of  the  influence  of  various  factors  on  agglomerate  ignition  and  forma¬ 
tion  and  of  the  potential  role  of  metallic  ingredients  on  the  burning  rate  and  energetic  efficiency 
of  solid  propellants,  put  forward  in  the  review  of  E.  Price  [4]  more  than  ten  years  ago,  are  still 
open  to  argument.  Moreover,  the  recent  investigations  of  modem  propellants,  containing  nitra- 
mines  and  energetic  binders,  add  new  problems.  In  particular,  the  questions  arise:  what  does  de¬ 
termine  A1  "capsulation"  in  coarse  agglomerates  upon  combustion  of  some  propellants  when  even 
after  a  significant  residence  time  of  agglomerates  in  the  flame  not  less  than  20%  of  initial  metal 
remain  unbumed?  What  is  the  role  of  the  energetic  binder  in  the  metal  agglomeration  and  igni¬ 
tion? 

Thus,  of  importance  is  the  role  of  the  correct  statement  and  adequate  interpretation  of  experi¬ 
mental  studies.  It  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the  technical  limitations  of  the  available  meth¬ 
ods  for  recording  condensed  particles,  which  may  have  substantial  effect  on  the  presence  of  the 
data,  obtained  by  a  concrete  method.  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to  combine  the  independent  methods  of 
recording  to  get  objective  information.  Note  that  regarding  the  data  on  the  burning  rate  of  solid 
propellants  there  are  semi  empirical  correlations  for  substituting  the  values  obtained  in  laboratory 
conditions  by  those,  corresponding  to  the  conditions  of  rocket  motors.  Similar  approach  to  ana¬ 
lyze  the  data  on  agglomeration  although  the  scale  effect  is  sure  to  exist. 

Finally,  note  that  the  synthesis  of  new  components  offers  new  possibilities  for  creating  novel 
formulations  of  solid  propellants.  Thus,  e.g.  the  use  of  ultrafine  powders  (the  so-called  ALEX 
etc.)  may  have  substantial  effect  on  the  characteristics  of  metal  ignition  and  agglomeration  in  the 
combustion  wave.  Most  promising,  however,  is  the  approach  based  on  the  novel  oxidizers  having 
extremely  high  enthalpy  of  formation  [89].  Calculations  show  that  in  propellants  with  energetic 
binders  the  substitution  of  AP  (formation  enthalpy  -602  cal/g)  by  a  hypothetical  oxidizer  with  the 
formation  enthalpy  exceeding  1000  cal/g  and  higher  causes  a  40-60  seconds  increase  in  specific 
impulse.  In  this  case,  there  is  no  need  to  use  metal  as  a  propellant  component  because  this  re¬ 
duces  the  impulse.  The  propellant  of  the  future  may  have  additional  advantages  due  to  the  ab¬ 
sence  of  chemical  and  two-phase  losses  in  the  specific  impulse  as  well  as  due  to  the  absence  of 
environmentally  dangerous  chlorine-containing  combustion  products.

CHAPTER  6 

TRANSIENT  COMBUSTION  OF  SOLID  PROPELLANTS 


Transient  combustion  of  solid  propellants  is  of  great  importance  for  both  technical  applications 
and  scientific  knowledge.  In  fact,  in  solid  rocket  motor  technology  and  applications  there  is  a  ur¬ 
gent  need  to  provide  the  correct  calculations  of  transitions  burning  rate  during  ignition  and  ex¬ 
tinction  as  well  as  to  estimate  the  stability  of  combustion  and  transients  from  one  combustion  re¬ 
gime  to  another. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  fundamental  Ya.B.  Zeldovich  work  [I],  published  in  1942,  ap¬ 
peared  due  to  the  practical  needs  of  solid  rocket  motor  development.  The  first  Russian  field  mis¬ 
sile  M8  (commonly  called  "Katyusha"  in  1940’s)  used  double-base  propellant,  which  experienced 
unstable  combustion.  The  Zeldovich  work  [1]  gave  a  start  for  the  further  development  of  ap¬ 
proaches  in  solids  combustion  and  for  a  long  time  served  a  basis  for  numerous  combustion  study 
works  in  Russia. 

Unfortunately,  the  Zeldovich  ideas  only  became  available  in  the  West  much  later.  Nevertheless, 
they  made  an  important  impact  on  the  development  of  the  combustion  theory  throughout  the 
world. 


6.1.  PHYSICAL  BACKGROUND  OF  MODELING  IN  NONSTATIONARY 
COMBUSTION  OF  SOLID  PROPELLANTS 

Development  of  universal  mechanisms  and  mathematical  models  for  the  nonstationary  combus¬ 
tion  of  solid  propellants  is  problematic  because  of  the  great  variety  and  complexity  of  physical 
and  chemical  phenomena  occurring  in  the  combustion  wave.  Hence  it  is  necessary  to  explore  the 
combustion  of  particular  types  of  solid  propellants  and  develop  generalized  approaches  [2], 

The  first  and  most  extensively  employed  model  of  nonstationary  combustion  [1]  dealt  with  ho¬ 
mogeneous  solid  propellants,  wherein  a  global  exothermic  reactions  proceeded  in  the  gas  and/or 
in  the  condensed  phase.  This  model  was  initially  used  for  description  of  combustion  processes  in 
nitroglycerin  powders;  then,  however,  a  similar  model  [3]  was  applied  to  the  combustion  of  het¬ 
erogeneous  solid  propellants.  At  the  same  time,  experiment  and  detailed  analysis  of  the  problem 
show  that  the  simplest  model  cannot  be  employed  even  in  the  case  of  homogeneous  solid  propel¬ 
lants  if  they  have  components  with  different  physico-chemical  properties.  Thus,  abrupt  switch-off 
of  a  sufficiently  intense  external  radiant  flux  results  in  instantaneous  formation  of  a  net  of  gas 
bubbles  on  the  burning  surface  of  nitroglycerin  powder.  A  similar  phenomenon  is  detected  at  a 
sharp  decrease  in  the  pressure.  In  this  case,  a  high  dispersion  of  the  surface  layer  can  be  accompa¬ 
nied,  in  addition  to  the  abovementioned  effects,  by  phenomena  related  with  temporal  and  spatial 
variations  of  local  concentrations  of  propellant  components  on  the  burning  surface  and  with  cor¬ 
responding  changes  in  local  burning  rates. 

It  is  obvious  that  more  comprehensive  and  detailed  models  for  nonstationary  solid  propellant 
combustion  should  be  developed,  which  would  allow  to  describe  in  a  realistic  way  the  behavior  of 


6-1 


a  burning  propellant.  At  first,  however,  it  is  reasonable  to  formulate,  according  to  Ref.  [4],  a  ra¬ 
tional  approach  to  studying  the  given  problem.  This  approach  involves  the  sequence  of  the  fol¬ 
lowing  steps: 

1.  Determination  of  restricted  domains  in  the  space  of  determining  parameters  and  development 
of  an  idealized  concept  of  the  physics  and  chemistry  of  the  process  for  each  domain. 

2.  Formulation  of  the  mathematical  model  for  the  process  in  the  chosen  domains  of  the  parame¬ 
ters. 

3.  Substantiation  of  the  applicability  limits  for  the  model,  development  of  a  system  of  test  ex¬ 
periments  and  criteria  for  domain  identification; 

4.  Designing  the  interpolation  relations,  integration  of  particular  models  into  a  system. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  complete  realization  of  this  approach  is  at  present  impossible  since  the 
collection  of  initial  data  on  the  first  three  steps  of  the  problem  is  not  finished.  Meanwhile  existing 
nonstationary  combustion  models  can  be  divided  into  two  groups. 

GROUP  1  -  modifications  of  the  classical  model  for  homogeneous  solid  propellant  combustion 
with  one  global  reaction  (following  references,  as  a  rule,  correspond  to  primary  works  and  quota¬ 
tions  may  be  incomplete). 

1.1.  Basic  model  (taking  into  account  a  finite  response  time  only  for  the  thermal  layer  in  the  con¬ 
densed  phase)  [1-3]. 

1.2.  Pressure  dependence  of  equilibrium  component  contents  and  gaseous  products  temperature 
[5]. 

1.3.  Change  in  the  flame  temperature  due  to  nonstationary  heat  feedback  to  condensed  phase  [6]. 

1.4.  Surface  layer  dispersion  at  variable  pressure  [7]. 

1.5.  Finite  response  time  delay  in  the  preheated  layer  of  the  gas  phase  [8]. 

GROUP  2  -  combustion  models  for  multicomponent  and  heterogeneous  solid  propellants. 

2.1.  Local  concentration  changes  due  to  accumulation  of  components  on  the  burning  surface  [9]. 

2.2.  Spatial  separation  of  the  zones  of  component  gasification  in  the  condensed  phase  of  homoge¬ 
neous  and  heterogeneous  solid  propellants  [10,  11, 11  a]. 

2.3.  Changes  in  the  temperature  profiles  in  the  combustion  wave  of  solid  propellants  with  fine 
and  coarse  inclusions  [12, 13]. 

2.4.  Time  synchronization  of  a  local  binder  layer  regression  rate  under  pressure  variation  [14]. 

It  is  evident  that  this  set  of  models  does  not  present  an  exhaustive  pattern  of  the  nonstationary 
combustion  of  solid  propellants  and  a  lot  of  work  is  to  be  done  in  order  to  make  it  sufficiently 
complete.  In  particular,  a  model  is  to  be  developed  corresponding  to  the  combustion  of  a  solid 
propellant  with  large  deviation  from  a  stoichiometric  mixture  formulation  (a  practically  important 
case  -  fuel  enriched  solid  propellants). 

Experiments  show  that  self-sustaining  combustion  of  such  solid  propellants  is  accompanied  by 
local  extinction  and  it  can  be  assumed  that  nonstationary  combustion  of  these  solid  propellants 
would  become  particularly  unstable.  Problems  of  synchronization  of  local  changes  in  the  reaction 
rate  on  the  burning  surface,  leading  to  integral  effects,  such  as  extinction  or  resonance  response, 
should  be  considered  in  more  detail.  Moreover,  the  models  are  to  be  improved  in  order  to  de¬ 
scribe  two-  and  three-dimensional  structures  and  take  into  account  changes  in  the  shape  of  the 
burning  surface  under  the  action  of  various  external  factors. 

In  the  case  when  solid  propellant  bums  in  a  semi-closed  volume,  in  addition  to  the  mass  and  lin- 


6-2 


ear  burning  rate,  of  great  importance  is  the  volume  rate  of  gas  release.  The  latter  depends  on  the 
completeness  of  chemical  reactions,  which  is  in  turn  a  function  of  mixing  and  reactant  residence 
time  in  the  reaction  volume.  One  has  also  to  consider  the  burning  law  for  particles  of  the  con¬ 
densed  phase  ejected  from  the  surface,  including  metal  particles. 

Mathematical  description  and  background  of  the  applicability  of  particular  models  in  solid  pro¬ 
pellant  nonstationary  combustion  require  special  attention.  Because  of  the  complexity  of  the  phe¬ 
nomenon,  its  description  involves,  as  a  rule,  some  a  priori  assumptions  and  includes  matching 
coefficients.  At  the  same  time,  technical  difficulties  restrict  the  possibilities  of  a  detailed  experi¬ 
mental  study  of  the  process  and  results  are  often  obtained  by  primitive  techniques.  It  is  obvious 
that  such  data  do  not  allow  one  to  reliably  establish  whether  a  description  corresponds  to  the  as¬ 
sumptions  made  as  well  as  to  determine  correctly  the  applicability  limits  of  a  model.  Hence,  it 
appears  that  test  experiments  should  be  formulated  with  the  measurement  of  space  and  time- 
resolved  characteristics  of  the  nonstationary  combustion  of  solid  propellant. 

Analysis  of  particular  models  of  nonstationary  burning  taking  into  account  specific  properties  of  a 
chosen  type  of  solid  propellant  makes  it  possible  to  get  certain  qualitative  conclusions.  Thus,  the 
account  of  a  finite  time  of  a  reaction  in  the  gas  phase  or  a  subsurface  volatile  component  release 
leads  to  changes  in  unstable  combustion  domain  boundaries  and  in  the  burning  rate  auto¬ 
oscillation  frequencies;  the  account  of  the  effects  of  ejected  particles  burning  and  incompleteness 
of  gas-phase  reactions  allows  one  to  determine  more  correctly  the  boundaries  of  stable  operations 
of  combustion  chambers.  On  the  basis  of  these  results  one  can  start  to  solve  the  problems  of  the 
fourth  step  -  the  development  of  a  system  of  particular  models  and  design  of  interpolation  rela¬ 
tions  for  description  of  the  phenomenon  in  intermediate  regions  of  determining  parameters. 

6.2.  NONSTATIONARY  COMBUSTION  OF  QUASI-HOMOGENEOUS  ENERGETIC 
MATERIALS  WITH  QUASI-STEADY  GAS  PHASE 

6.2.1.  Development  of  transient  combustion  theory  in  Russia. 

Fundamentals  of  approach  by  Zeldovich  and  Novozhilov.  In  1942,  the  model  of  transient  com¬ 
bustion  of  solid  propellants  was  by  Ya.B.  Zeldovich  [1]  based  on  the  following  assumptions  pro¬ 
posed: 

The  characteristic  thermal  relaxation  time  in  the  gas  phase  is  much  less  than  that  in  the 
condensed  phase  (the  gas  phase  processes  are  quasi-steady), 

The  temperature  at  the  burning  surface  is  constant  at  given  pressure  (Tso  =  const). 

There  are  no  chemical  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase.  The  burning  rate  is  totally  deter¬ 
mined  by  the  reactions  in  the  gas  phase. 

Obviously,  the  last  two  assumptions  have  been  made  following  existing  concepts  of  liquid  explo¬ 
sives  combustion  [15].  Later,  1975,  Zeldovich  observed  [16]  that  for  real  propellants  the  condi¬ 
tions  at  the  burning  surface  seem  to  be  very  different  of  that  proposed  above  and  concluded  that 
his  model  should  be  applied  for  very  particular  compositions.  Based  on  the  main  assumption  of 
quasi-steady  gas  phase  behavior  the  key  statement  of  the  dependence  of  instantaneous  burning 
rate  on  the  current  values  of  pressure  and  surface  temperature  gradient  was  formulated  [1]: 

rb(t)  =  r(P(t),cp(t))  (6.1) 


6-3 


Here  cp  =  (8T  /  9x  )x=0  =  rb  (Ts  -  TO  /  a  is  assumed  to  be  valid  both  in  steady  state  and  transient 
conditions;  a  -  thermal  diffusivity  in  the  condensed  phase. 

As  the  expression  (6.1)  is  true  for  steady-state  combustion  it  was  convenient  to  determine  ex¬ 
perimental  data  on  rb(f)  from  the  dependence  of  burning  rate  on  initial  temperature.  This  approach 
where  the  unknown  chemistry  of  combustion  is  included  in  the  empirical  information  has  been 
called  the  "phenomenological"  approach. 

Attempts  to  construct  models  of  transient  combustion  with  non-zero  dependence  of  surface  tem¬ 
perature  on  initial  temperature  were  undertaken  later  in  [17,18]  with  particular  assumptions  con¬ 
cerning  heat  release  function.  Finally,  in  1965  B.V.  Novozhilov  proposed  [19]  an  extended  ver¬ 
sion  of  the  phenomenological  approach  now  called  in  the  literature  the  Zeldovich-Novozhilov 
(ZN)  approach.  This  approach  is  described  in  details  in  an  excellent  book  [20]  published  in  1973. 

According  to  the  ZN  approach  the  exothermic  chemical  reactions  may  proceed  both  in  the  gas 
and  condensed  phases.  However,  the  space  extension  of  the  reaction  zone  in  condensed  phase  due 
to  the  high  activation  energy  of  chemical  reactions  is  assumed  to  be  very  thin  compared  with  the 
preheated  layer  of  the  propellant.  Therefore,  in  addition  to  the  assumption  of  quasi-steady  gas 
phase,  it  is  assumed  that  the  thermal  relaxation  time  of  condensed  phase  reaction  zone  is  much 
less  than  the  relaxation  time  of  the  propellant  thermal  layer.  Consequently,  the  problem  of  tran¬ 
sient  combustion  is  formulated  in  a  very  simple  form  which  includes  the  thermal  conductivity 
equation  for  an  inert  condensed  phase  with  the  closing  "phenomenological"  correlation  and 
boundary  conditions  [20]: 

3T  /  3t  +  rb  0T  /  0x)  =  a  (d2T  /  dx2)  (6.2) 

(p  =  <p[rb(t),P(t)]  (6.3) 

T(x,0)  =  T(x);  T(0,t)  =  Ts  (cp,  P);  T(oo,  t)  =  T,  (6.4) 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  quasi  steady  gas  phase  assumption  becomes  invalid  at  high  pressures. 
Stability  of  the  steady-state  combustion .  In  his  original  paper  Zeldovich  [1]  introduced  an  addi¬ 
tional  assumption  which  concerned  the  initial  temperature  dependence  of  burning  rate.  He  pro¬ 
posed  [1]  that  crp  =  3ln  rb0(TO  /  9Tj  =  const  that  corresponds  to  an  exponential  or  linear  rb0(Ti)  de¬ 
pendence.  Analyzing  the  expression  for  the  first  integral  of  the  thermal  conductivity  equation  it 
was  determined  that  the  function  <p(Ti)  must  have  a  maximum  and  the  burning  rate  has  2  values  at 
cp  <  cpmax.  The  maximum  value  of  the  surface  temperature  gradient  is  determined  by  the  condition 
dcp/dTj  =  0. 


From  this  condition  one  can  derive  ap(Tso  -  T,)  =  k  =  1  and  Zeldovich  concluded  that  it  corre¬ 
sponds  to  the  limit  of  combustion.  It  followed  from  this  analysis  that  decreasing  Tj  leads  to  in¬ 
creasing  surface  temperature  gradient  and  the  combustion  limit  (k  =  1)  corresponds  to  the  mini¬ 
mum  value  Tj;  min  =  Tso  -  l/op. 

The  path  of  the  loss  of  stability  was  not  analyzed  in  [I].  Later,  in  the  analysis  of  small  perturba¬ 
tions,  made  by  Novozhilov  [19,20],  it  was  shown  that  the  steady-state  combustion  wave  is  unsta¬ 
ble  at  k  >  1  when  the  parameter  rN  =  0TsO  /3T0P  is  less  than  the  critical  value  rN*  =  (k-1)2/ 
(k+1).  If  rN  =  rN*,  the  burning  rate  manifests  non-damping  oscillating  behavior  with  frequency  of 
oscillations  Q  =  k0  5/  rN;  at  rN  <  rN*  the  oscillations  grow  in  amplitude  and,  finally,  at  rN<  rN**  = 
k+l-2k0  5  the  burning  rate  perturbations  grow  exponentially  in  time.  Classical  analysis  [20]  was 


6-4 


further  developed  in  several  subsequent  works.  For  example,  it  was  shown  in  [21]  that  the  stabil¬ 
ity  domain  becomes  less  if  the  preheated  layer  is  narrower  than  the  thermal  layer  in  stationary 
combustion  wave.  The  presence  of  the  external  radiant  flux  makes  the  stability  domain  broader  in 
the  case  of  the  opaque  propellant,  and  vice  versa  [22]. 

A  comparison  with  experimental  results  could  only  be  made  on  the  basis  of  steady-state  combus¬ 
tion  data  [20],  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  there  are  controversial  points  of  view  in  the  literature 
on  the  role  of  initial  temperature  in  loss  of  combustion  stability  for  double  base  propellants.  The 
detailed  study  of  the  temperature  profiles,  performed  by  Zenin  in  the  1960’s,  showed  that  the  real 
dependence  of  burning  rate  on  surface  temperature  gradient  is  exactly  opposite  to  that  assumed  by 
Zeldovich  in  1940’s:  the  higher  the  burning  rate,  the  higher  surface  temperature  gradient  [23]. 
Also,  the  initial  temperature  burning  rate  dependence  was  found  to  be  so  strong  that  it  occurred, 
in  contradiction  with  [1]  ,  that  k  <  1  at  low  initial  temperatures,  but  k  >  1  at  high  initial  tempera¬ 
tures  [23,24].  It  followed  from  these  findings  that  at  high  ambient  temperature  one  could  observe 
unstable  combustion  of  double  base  propellants.  Recently,  reliable  proof  of  the  combustion  sta¬ 
bility  loss  at  high  ambient  temperatures  was  found  [25,26]  in  experiments  with  dynamic  meas¬ 
urement  of  the  propellant  recoil  force  which  is  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  regression  rate.  It 
was  observed  that  after  cutting  off  of  the  radiant  flux  the  self-sustaining  combustion  of  double 
base  catalyzed  lead  oxide  propellant  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  ambient  temperatures  100-120 
°C  proceeds  with  regular  non-attenuating  oscillations  of  the  burning  rate.  At  lower  ambient  tem¬ 
peratures,  the  amplitude  of  burning  rate  oscillations  after  deradiation  decreases  in  time  due  to  the 
damping  effect.  This  observation  provides  direct  evidence  of  the  loss  of  combustion  stability  at 
elevated  initial  temperatures  for  double  base  propellants  with  high  burning  rate  temperature  de¬ 
pendence. 

The  above  conclusion  is  in  apparent  contradiction  with  experimental  observation  of  pulsating 
temperature  profiles  at  low  initial  temperatures  but  smooth  temperature  records  at  high  initial 
temperatures  [23].  It  has  given  in  the  past  the  reason  for  several  authors  to  consider  lowering  the 
initial  temperature  as  a  cause  of  loss  of  combustion  stability  [16,20,23].  However,  visualization  of 
double-base  propellant  combustion  at  atmospheric  pressure  shows  the  existence  of  macroscopic 
active  reaction  spots  on  the  burning  surface  which  become  most  pronounced  at  low  ambient  tem¬ 
peratures  [27],  Therefore,  the  pulsations  of  the  temperature  at  these  operating  conditions  are  of 
local  character.  In  fact,  they  characterize  a  non-uniform  (two-dimensional)  regression  of  the  sur¬ 
face  layer  but  not  the  loss  of  combustion  stability  in  terms  of  the  one-dimensional  quasi-steady 
approach. 

Time-dependent  combustion.  Transient  burning  occurs  due  to  finite  disturbances  of  the  combus¬ 
tion  environment,  such  as  time-dependent  pressure,  blowing  gas  flow,  radiant  flux,  etc.  The 
question  arises,  what  are  the  critical  values  of  external  parameters  which  could  induce  a  cata¬ 
strophic  decrease  of  the  burning  rate?  The  first  estimate  of  the  critical  values  was  made  by  Zeldo¬ 
vich  [I].  His  analysis  was  based  on  the  assumption  of  extremely  high  surface  temperature  gradi¬ 
ents  (erroneously  attributed  to  the  very  low  initial  temperatures)  which  could  cause  the  extinction 
of  the  propellant. 

The  Zeldovich  concept  of  extinction  can  be  called  "static"  as  it  predicted  a  cessation  of  combus- 


tion  immediately  after  reaching  a  critical  value  of  surface  temperature  gradient.  A  static  concept 
became  very  attractive  due  to  its  great  simplicity  and  was  used  in  the  numerous  subsequent  works 
[28-31].  When  combined  with  Novozhilov’s  stability  analysis,  the  concept  meant  that  the  com¬ 
bustion  ceases  at  the  boundary  of  oscillating  combustion.  The  concept  of  an  extinction  boundary 
was  formulated  in  [32,20]  but  it  was  doubted  later  by  Frost  and  Yumashev  [33,21].  They  discov¬ 
ered,  through  computer  aided  simulation  of  propellant  combustion  under  depressurization,  that 
one  needs  no  special  hypothesis  about  critical  conditions  in  order  to  characterize  the  extinction 
phenomenon.  The  extinction  occurs  due  to  progressive  cooling  of  the  condensed  phase  surface 
layer  that  manifests  itself  in  the  appearance  of  an  inflection  point  on  the  temperature  profile  in  the 
bulk  of  the  propellant.  They  also  revealed  that  in  the  course  of  transient  combustion  the  parame¬ 
ters  of  the  burning  system  may  temporarily  correspond  to  an  unstable  combustion  domain  but  it 
does  not  serve  sufficient  condition  for  extinction. 

These  findings  gave  a  background  for  the  development  of  a  "dynamic"  extinction  concept  based 
on  examining  the  dynamic  behavior  of  burning  rate.  According  to  this  concept,  the  extinction  is 
determined  not  only  by  the  instantaneous  parameters  of  the  system  at  the  given  moment  of  time, 
but  also  by  the  prehistory  of  heating  and  the  dynamic  properties  of  the  system  (temperature  sensi¬ 
tivity  of  the  burning  rate).  Further,  the  most  significant  contribution  in  the  development  of  the 
dynamic  concept  was  made  in  the  works  of  De  Luca  [34]. 

The  problem,  which  has  not  yet  a  clear  answer,  is  how  to  predict  the  very  low  values  of  burning 
rate?  The  formal  way  is  to  use  extrapolated  at  low  temperatures  the  expressions  for  the  burning 
rate  versus  initial  temperature  dependence.  However,  sometimes  it  takes  introducing  (for  small 
burning  rate)  negative  values  of  absolute  temperature  that  has  no  physical  sense.  In  addition,  it 
corresponds  to  very  low  magnitudes  of  the  surface  temperature  in  accordance  with  the  pyrolysis 
law. 

It  was  proposed  in  [20]  to  terminate  the  dependence  rb(f)  at  certain  low  value  of  the  surface  tem¬ 
perature  gradient.  However,  the  proposal  was  not  specified.  Another  approach  is  to  check  the  du¬ 
ration  of  transient  processes  and  to  qualify  transients  with  too  long  duration  as  an  extinction  [35]. 
But  in  this  case  one  should  justify  the  extrapolation  of  experimental  dependencies  when  using 
classical  phenomenological  approach. 

Ignition  to  combustion  transitions.  Ignition  transients  are  a  classical  example  of  nonstationary 
combustion  of  a  propellant  with  arbitrary  initial  temperature  distribution  in  a  solid.  However, 
when  describing  the  phenomenon,  it  should  be  taken  into  account  the  absence  of  developed 
chemical  reactions  in  the  gas  phase  until  the  inflammation  that  makes  doubtful  the  application 
[32]  of  the  ZN  method  for  calculating  the  burning  rate  during  the  initial  stage  of  combustion. 

Based  on  energetic  considerations,  Zeldovich  proposed  [1]  that  for  successful  ignition  one  should 
simultaneously  provide  two  conditions:  reaching  the  steady-state  combustion  surface  temperature 
with  the  surface  temperature  gradient  being  less  than  the  critical  (maximum)  value.  It  is  easy  to 
recognize  that  this  statement  is  well  justified  for  heating  regimes  similar  to  those  in  a  quasi¬ 
stationary  combustion.  However,  the  static  concept  gives  a  wrong  prediction  when  applied  to  ar¬ 
bitrary  heating  history.

For  example,  if  the  heat  flux  is  high  at  the  initial  stage  and  low  enough  at  the  final  heating  stage 
the  above  conditions  can  be  met  at  a  certain  moment  of  time  but  with  abnormally  low  heat  stor¬ 
age  in  the  condensed  phase.  Obviously,  the  ignition  transient  will  depend  in  this  case  on  a  number 
of  factors  and  could  not  be  predicted  a  priori.  This  comment  refers,  in  particular,  the  well-known 
paper  by  Librovich  [36],  (see  also  [16,  Ch.  5,  sect.3])  where  the  ignition  delay  time  was  computed 
for  a  propellant  with  a  boiling  surface  temperature.  It  was  stated  [36]  that  in  the  case  of  relatively 
high  heat  fluxes  the  energy  source  should  be  kept  for  a  certain  time  after  reaching  the  boiling 
temperature  in  order  to  diminish,  due  to  the  latent  heat  losses,  below  the  critical  value  the  net  heat 
flux  penetrating  into  the  bulk  of  propellant.  However,  it  is  clear  that  after  removal  of  the  intense 
external  heat  source  the  condensed  phase  enthalpy  excess  will  be  less  than  that  in  stationary  com¬ 
bustion  wave,  and  will  lead  to  a  drastic  decrease  in  the  burning  rate.  The  expected  result  of  the 
following  transient  is  extinction. 

A  static  concept  could  not  be  applied  to  the  most  realistic  problems  of  transient  combustion  due 
to  the  great  complexity  and  coupling  the  physical  and  chemical  processes  in  a  combustion  wave. 
As  an  illustration,  one  may  consider  the  ignition  by  propagating  combustion  wave  passing 
through  the  interface  of  solid  propellant  samples  in  contact.  Depending  on  the  physicochemical 
parameters  of  both  samples,  various  initial  temperature  profiles  in  the  ignited  propellant  can  be 
realized.  When  doing  numerical  simulation  within  the  framework  of  the  ZN  approach,  it  was  re¬ 
vealed  [38,39]  that  the  extinction  boundary  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  ratio  of  steady-state 
combustion  wave  parameters  for  igniting  and  ignited  propellants.  In  particular,  the  higher  the  ra¬ 
tio  of  the  enthalpy  excess,  the  more  stable  the  combustion  wave  propagation  through  the  contact 
surface  at  a  given  ratio  of  surface  temperature  gradients.  If  one  fixes  the  igniting  propellant  pa¬ 
rameters  the  high  stability  of  transition  is  provided  with  a  large  thermal  relaxation  time  in  the  ig¬ 
nited  propellant  (high  thermal  diffusivity  or  small  burning  rate).  The  critical  values  of  parameters 
corresponding  to  an  extinction  boundary  were  found  to  depend  on  the  chosen  values  of  activation 
energy  in  the  pyrolysis  law  and  burning  rate  temperature  sensitivity.  Simple  expressions  for  the 
critical  conditions  of  extinction  could  not  be  derived  and  it  requires  special  computational  work 
to  characterize  transient  combustion  for  a  chosen  pair  of  propellant. 

6.2.2.  Review  of  western  combustion  response  modeling 

Fundamental  western  approach.  This  section  deals  with  the  approaches  to  the  problems  of  tran¬ 
sient  combustion  in  the  western  world.  This  is  a  very  broad  area  of  technical  work.  Therefore,  this 
section  will  mainly  focus  on  the  approaches  used  within  the  US,  and  primarily  on  the  relationship 
of  acoustic  interaction  with  transient  combustion.  This  is  a  significant  difference  in  the  ap¬ 
proaches  between  the  Russian  work  and  that  of  the  US.  In  the  US  approach  there  has  been  an  em¬ 
phasis  on  acoustic  combustion  instability  whereas  the  Russian  approach  seems  to  have  been 
broader,  applying  a  fundamental  transient  combustion  approach  (i.e.  the  ZN  approach)  to  a  wide 
variety  of  applications  such  as  extinguishment,  ignition,  spontaneous  oscillatory  combustion,  etc. 
Within  the  US  different  models  and  theories  have  been  applied  to  each  different  type  of  applica¬ 
tion. 

The  basis  for  what  can  be  considered  as  the  foundations  of  what  has  become  the  modem  US  ap¬ 
proach  to  evaluating  combustion  instability  was  established  in  [40,  3].  Early  work  on  combustion 


6-7 


instability  began  in  the  1940’s.  This  was  followed  with  studies  by  several  workers  [41  -  43].  The 
work  of  the  Hart  and  McClure  group  at  the  Applied  Physics  Laboratory  [40]  and  the  subsequent 
paper  by  Denison  and  Baum  [3]  focused  attention  on  the  acoustic  interaction  with  transient  com¬ 
bustion.  A  result  of  these  works  was  a  concise  equation  describing  the  transient  response  function 
(i.e.  the  response  of  the  burning  rate  to  a  pressure  perturbations).  In  parallel  with  their  work,  ex¬ 
perimental  work  was  being  performed  [44,45]  at  the  NOTS  at  China  Lake,  California  developing 
the  T-bumer.  The  T-bumer  provided  experimental  measurements  of  pressure  response  functions 
for  comparison  with  theory,  giving  additional  emphasis  to  the  focus  on  acoustic  applications.  This 
approach  provided  a  philosophical  basis  for  a  majority  of  subsequent  studies.  Since  that  time 
many  theoretical  studies  have  compared  their  results  with  T-bumer  data. 

The  original  Hart  and  McClure  paper  allowed  for  a  transient  gas  phase,  but  subsequent  paper  [46] 
made  the  simplifying  assumption  of  a  quasi  steady  state  (QSS)  gas  phase.  The  Denison  and  Baum 
paper  also  assumed  a  QSS  gas  phase.  In  1968  Culick  [47]  reviewed  the  various  models  that  had 
been  published  to  that  time  (in  the  western  literature).  His  review  was  very  significant  as  he 
summarized  the  various  papers  into  a  common  format.  He  concluded  that  all  the  models  that  as¬ 
sumed  a  quasi  steady  flame  reduced  to  a  common  numerical  form.  The  form  of  the  response 
function  that  he  used  is 

R  =  (nT  /  mo)/(p'/  po)  =  nAB  /  [X+(A/A,)-(1+A)+AB]  (6.5) 

where  the  parameters  A  and  B  are  defined  as 

A  =  (E/RTs0)  (1  -  Tj  /  T  so)  and  B  =  1  /  [op(T  s0  -  TO], 

Q  is  the  non-dimensional  frequency  and  X(£2)  is  a  complex  function  of  frequency. 

Some  models  included  a  second  term  in  the  numerator  representing  a  heterogeneous,  pressure  de¬ 
pendent  surface  reaction.  Most  models  and  subsequent  work  have  dropped  that  term  as  not  being 
physically  realistic.  This  is  consistent  with  Russian  work.  Zenin  and  Novozhilov  [48]  showed  that 
the  surface  temperature  of  double  base  propellant  is  a  function  of  burning  rate  only  (not  pressure), 
allowing  them  to  set  the  parameter  8P  to  zero  in  the  ZN  theory.  The  resulting  ZN  response  func¬ 
tion  is  then  equivalent  to  the  form  used  by  Culick  and  adopted  through  most  of  the  western  lit¬ 
erature. 

The  equivalence  of  the  quasi  steady-state  gas  flame  approaches .  In  1971  Summerfield,  et  al. 
published  the  first  work  in  the  US  based  on  the  Russian  ZN  approach  [32].  This  started  another 
debate  about  which  approach  was  better  or  more  correct.  In  his  1973  monograph  [20],  Novozhi¬ 
lov  recognized  that  the  approaches  were  identical  and  that  the  results  should  be  equivalent.  In¬ 
deed,  the  stability  boundary  presented  by  Denison  and  Baum  coincides  with  that  of  the  ZN  model 
[20].  However,  this  was  not  realized  in  the  west  for  some  time.  Several  papers  were  published  by 
Osborn  and  his  students  "comparing"  the  results  of  the  two  methods  [49,50].  They  apparently 
made  some  error  in  their  interpretation  of  the  two  approaches  as  they  calculated  significantly  dif¬ 
ferent  results  between  the  two.  Eventually  it  was  realized  that  the  approaches  were  equivalent 

[51]. 

The  Russian  work  can  be  related  to  western  work  by  comparing  response  function  equations.  The 
ZN  response  can  be  stated  as  (see  Novozhilov  [20],  and  Zarko,  et  al.  [52]) 

W  =  (Arb/rb0)  /  (AP/Po)  =  (vp  +  z  5P)  /  [  1  -  k  +  z  (rN  -  ik  /  Q)]  (6.6)

Here  z  =  iY  +  0.5  (Q-Y)/Y;  Y  =  (1/8)05  [(1  +  16Q2)05  -  if5;  8P=  vprN  -  Ppk. 

Comparing  the  parameters,  within  the  two  models,  the  following  equivalence  can  be  made  be¬ 
tween  the  ZN  model  and  western  models.

Calculation  of  Combustion  Instability  Parameters  for  Response  Calculations.  During  the  mid 
1970’  there  was  a  significant  effort  of  modeling  steady  state  combustion  with  the  development  of 
the  PEM  version  [49]  of  the  BDP  model  and  the  extension  of  the  BDP  model  by  Beckstead  to 
apply  to  a  variety  of  different  propellant  types  [53,54].  It  was  recognized  [49,53]  that  the  calcu¬ 
lated  steady  state  combustion  parameters  could  be  used  to  calculate  the  unsteady  parameters  of 
the  Denison  and  Baum  (DB)  model  which  is  somewhat  analogous  to  the  ZN  approach.  The  sur¬ 
face  activation  energy  and  the  solid  thermal  diffusivity  are  input  parameters  to  the  models.  The 
models  then  calculate  the  burning  rate,  surface  temperature  and  temperature  sensitivity  all  as  a 
function  of  pressure  and  the  pressure  exponent  is  also  calculated.  These  are  all  of  the  values 
needed  for  a  calculation  of  the  response  function.  An  inherent  assumption  in  the  unsteady  analysis 
is  that  the  propellant  is  homogeneous  and  that  the  flame  is  premixed.  For  a  composite  propellant 
it  is  recognized  that  the  solid  is  not  homogeneous  and  that  the  combustion  controlling  mechanism 
is  usually  the  primary  diffusion  flame.  In  the  various  applications  to  composite  propellants,  it  is 
recognized  that  there  is  an  additional  assumption  that  the  parameters  calculated  in  the  steady  state 
model,  average  the  heterogeneity  and  diffusional  aspects  of  the  propellant  sufficiently  to  allow  the 
use  of  either  the  ZN  or  DB  model.  This  is  recognized  as  a  significant  assumption  of  questionable 
validity.  However,  with  these  inherent  assumptions  this  approach  has  been  applied  to  a  wide  vari¬ 
ety  of  AP/HTPB  composite  propellants  [49,50,53],  to  simple  double  base  propellants  [54,55],  to 
AP/HMX  containing  double  base  propellants  [54],  and  more  recently  to  advanced  propellants 
[56].  In  all  cases  the  validation  of  this  approach  has  been  difficult  due  to  the  lack  of  quantitative 
data  for  the  various  propellant  types. 

In  a  parallel  effort,  Cohen  was  developing  a  model  to  account  for  the  heterogeneity  of  composite 
propellants  [e.g.,  57,58].  His  basic  premise  was  that  there  should  be  a  "layer  frequency"  associ¬ 
ated  with  the  oxidizer  particle  size  of  composite  propellants.  This  concept  had  been  postulated 
early  both  in  the  US  [59]  and  in  Russia  [60].  Cohen  combined  the  ideas  of  a  layer  frequency  with 
the  two  parameter  DB  type  of  model  to  develop  a  model  that  would  exhibit  multiple  response 
peaks.  He  has  published  a  very  useful  review  [61]  of  the  models  used  in  modeling  the  unstable 
response  of  composite  propellants.  He  has  continued  to  publish  a  variety  of  papers  [e.g.,  62,63] 


6-9 


where  he  has  modeled  the  effect  of  oxidizer  particle  size  on  the  combustion  response  function. 
The  validation  of  his  concepts  has  been  difficult  due  to  the  lack  of  quantitative  data  showing  this 
specific  effect.  Only  recently  there  were  published  experimental  results  showing  the  lack  of  direct 
correlation  between  the  oxidizer  size  and  maximum  combustion  response  frequency  [64]. 

Recent  work.  Several  recent  papers  have  by  published  by  Margolis,  et  al.  [65-67].  They  have  used 
a  large  activation  energy  asymptotic  approach  to  model  monopropellant  (or  homogeneous  pro¬ 
pellant)  combustion.  They  have  looked  at  intrinsic  instability  rather  than  the  acoustic  coupling 
problem,  and  in  this  sense  their  work  is  somewhat  analogous  to  corresponding  Russian  studies. 
Deur  and  Price  have  published  two  papers  [68,69]  trying  to  incorporate  the  effects  of  a  diffusion 
flame  into  the  standard  DB  type  of  model.  They  postulate  that  the  leading  edge  of  a  diffusion 
flame  can  be  kinetically  controlled  and  thus  could  have  a  profound  influence  on  a  propellant’s  in¬ 
stability  characteristics.  They  assume  a  linear  relationship  between  the  diffusion  flame  perturba¬ 
tions  and  the  normal  premixed  flame  response.  Their  calculations  indicate  a  lower  but  broader 
response  curve  for  a  typical  composite  propellant. 

Both  Clavin,  et  al.  [70]  and  Micci,  et  al.  [71]  have  recently  published  models  relaxing  the  QSS 
gas  phase  assumption.  Clavin  et  al.  apply  a  large  activation  energy  asymptotic  approach  and  cal¬ 
culate  an  extended,  high  response  for  higher  frequencies,  which  intuitively  seems  correct.  How¬ 
ever,  the  results  of  calculating  non  dimensional  maximum  response  frequency  should  be  carefully 
checked  as  their  numbers  are  an  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  those  typically  calculated  by  oth¬ 
ers.  Micci ’s  approach  is  based  on  a  three  step  kinetics  model  for  the  flame  which  gives  the  classi¬ 
cal  two  stage  flame  observed  for  double  base  propellants  including  the  dark  zone.  Micci’s  results 
also  show  a  higher  amplification  at  higher  frequencies,  and  their  frequency  numbers  are  consis¬ 
tent  with  previous  studies.  These  results  look  very  promising. 

Yang,  et  al.  [72]  have  also  published  recent  work  relaxing  the  global  kinetics  assumption  that 
most  authors  have  made  in  the  past.  They  use  the  same  three  step  kinetic  mechanism  for  the  gas 
phase  that  Micci,  et  al.  used,  but  they  also  use  a  three  step  mechanism  for  the  condensed  phase. 
They  do  not  report  any  actual  response  function  calculations,  as  their  calculations  are  coupled  to  a 
fluid  dynamics  model  for  a  rocket  motor. 

Totally  transient  combustion  problem  formulation.  Based  on  the  contemporary  knowledge  of 
combustion  theory  [73,74],  the  governing  equations  for  solid  propellant  transient  combustion  can 
be  written.  However,  keeping  in  mind  a  variety  of  physical  and  chemical  processes  involved  in 
solids  combustion,  there  is  an  important  question  how  to  formulate  boundary  conditions.  The 
main  shortcomings  are  connected  at  the  present  time  with  the  treatment  of  the  processes  in  the 
condensed  phase.  For  example,  it  is  difficult  to  describe  in  details  the  behavior  of  subsurface  layer 
(phase  changes,  bubbles  formation  and  destruction,  overall  chemical  mechanism  of  condensed 
phase  reactions,  etc.)  in  transient  conditions  when  the  temperature  and  residence  time  change  in 
very  broad  range.  There  are  no  substantiated  solutions  of  the  listed  problems  so  far.  Therefore, 
one  may  treat  existing  approaches  as  only  approximate  and  preliminary  attempts  to  solve  the  ex¬ 
act  transient  problem. 

There  are  significant  difficulties  in  analytical  solving  this  problem  due  to  the  strong  non  linearity 


6-10 


of  the  governing  equations.  However,  a  recent  attempt  has  been  made  by  Novozhilov  [8]  who  re¬ 
ceived  a  very  interesting  result  concerning  the  combustion  behavior  of  propellant  at  small  mag¬ 
nitudes  of  parameter  rN.  Based  on  the  Belyayev  model  of  explosives  combustion  [15]  with  melt¬ 
ing  and  boiling  at  the  burning  surface  and  considering  nonstationary  gas  phase  processes,  the  total 
characteristic  time  of  thermal  relaxation  of  the  burning  system  becomes  dependable  on  the  com¬ 
plex  tg2/3  tc1/3  [8],  where  tg  and  tc  are  the  characteristic  thermal  relaxation  times  for  the  gas  and 
condensed  phases,  correspondingly,  and  tc  » tg. 

One  of  the  first  examples  of  fully  transient  propellant  combustion  problem  formulation  was  made 
30  years  ago  by  Vilyunov,  et  al.  [75].  They  assumed  that  the  gas  phase  did  not  exchange  heat  with 
the  condensed  phase  (adiabatic  condition)  and  that  the  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  obeyed  a 
first  order  law  and  proceeded  to  a  fixed  degree.  During  ignition  transients,  damping  oscillations 
of  burning  rate  were  discovered.  It  was  later  recognized  [76,77]  that  the  burning  rate  oscillations 
during  transition  to  self-sustaining  combustion  are  not  a  unique  feature  of  transient  combustion 
but  depend  on  the  kinetic  parameters  of  particular  type  of  solid  propellant. 

A  more  detailed  description  of  gas  phase  reactions  but  with  a  heterogeneous  reaction  on  the  pro¬ 
pellant  surface  was  introduced  by  Armstrong  and  Koszykowski  [78].  They  analyzed  the  temporal 
behavior  of  the  temperature  and  reactant  mass  fraction  for  the  cases  of  "weak"  and  "strong"  gas 
phase  reaction.  It  was  found  that  for  a  stationary  burning  solid  propellant  with  a  detached  flame 
("weak"  gas  phase  reaction)  the  thermal  profile  behavior  after  cutting  off  relatively  high  strength 
external  energy  source  is  the  same  as  that  which  would  be  obtained  without  taking  into  account 
exothermic  reaction  in  the  gas  phase.  The  reason  for  this  is  a  small  heat  content  in  a  gas  phase 
comparatively  with  a  larger  one  in  the  condensed  phase. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  role  of  gas  phase  reactions  appears  to  be  more  important  in  igni¬ 
tion  transients  [79].  It  was  found  that  the  "peninsula"  of  stable  ignition  transients  is  larger  in  the 
case  of  coupled  gas  and  condensed  phase  reactions  as  compared  with  the  case  of  pure  condensed 
reactions. 

A  more  sophisticated  approach  taking  into  consideration  2  condensed  phase  and  2  gas  phase  re¬ 
actions  has  been  proposed  by  Price  and  Boggs  [80].  However,  to  simplify  the  problem,  a  flow  re¬ 
actor  scheme  was  chosen  for  the  gas  phase  reactions  and  time-dependent  heat  feedback  to  the 
solid  interface  was  written  in  terms  of  flame  standoff  distance.  The  model  has  described  the  igni¬ 
tion  delay  and  steady-state  burning  rate  for  several  homogeneous  propellants  on  the  basis  of  a 
given  set  of  identical  parameters  for  both  transient  and  stationary  conditions.  The  kinetic  pa¬ 
rameters  are  determined  by  comparison  with  burning  rate  and  ignition  data. 

Recently,  theoretical  approach  was  developed  by  Knyazeva  and  Zarko  [81]  who  considered  two 
first  order  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase  and  one  second  order  reaction  in  the  gas  phase.  The 
stability  of  ignition  transients  to  self-sustaining  combustion  after  removal  the  external  energy 
source  was  found  to  depend  on  the  choice  of  ignition  (extinction)  criteria.  It  was  also  confirmed 
once  more(see  [78,82])  that  at  least  for  relatively  weak  gas-phase  reactions  the  heating  of  the  pro¬ 
pellant  by  powerful  heat  source  (higher  than  intrinsic  heat  source  in  the  combustion  wave)  inevi¬ 
tably  leads  to  extinction  after  fast  removal  of  the  external  heat  source.  This  behavior  has  been  ex-

perimentally  observed  in  the  experiments  with  double  base  propellants  ignited  by  radiant  fluxes 
[83,84], 

6.2.3.  Intrinsic  difficulties  and  challenges  in  use  of  quasi-steady-state  approaches. 

QSS  approaches  could  be  used  after  making  the  appropriate  estimates  of  thermal  relaxation  times 
in  condensed  and  gas  phases.  It  is  difficult  to  do  these  estimates  because  we  know  very  little 
about  the  fundamental  mechanism  and  kinetics  of  the  condensed  phase  chemical  reactions.  It  be¬ 
comes  most  questionable  for  propellant  formulations  with  components  that  melt  and  decompose 
at  relatively  low  temperatures. 

QSS  approaches  should  be  applied  in  the  ranges  of  parameters  where  the  dependencies  rbo(Ti)  and 
rbo(Tso)  are  reliably  known  experimentally  or  theoretically.  Consequently,  without  special  sub¬ 
stantiation  it  is  impossible  to  use  the  approaches  for  simulation  of  transient  combustion  in  ex¬ 
treme  burning  conditions  like  ignition  and  extinction  . 

When  applying  the  ZN  approach,  one  needs  precise  data  on  rbo(Tj)  and  Tso  (TO  dependencies  and 
their  derivatives  ctp  and  rN.  There  are  obvious  technical  difficulties  in  obtaining  these  data.  For 
example,  to  obtain  the  value  rN  ~  0.5  with  an  accuracy  of  ~  20%  the  value  of  Tso  should  be 
measured  with  an  absolute  error  of  no  more  than  1-2  K  if  the  initial  temperature  interval  is  10-20 
K.  These  limits  are  not  possible  in  real  experiments  where  the  accuracy  of  Tso  measurement  is  no 
better  than  ~  10-20  K  [23,  24,  83].  Determining  cp  values  it  is  also  difficult  to  provide  accepted 
accuracy  with  weak  rbo(Ti)  dependencies.  When  op  ~  10’2  and  AT0  ~  20K  the  op  10%  accuracy 
requires  an  accuracy  of  the  rtx,  measurement  of  ~  2%  which  is  possible,  but  could  not  be  improved 
significantly.  Therefore  it  is  practically  impossible  to  obtain  the  values  of  ap  <  10'2  with  an  accu¬ 
racy  better  than  20-40%. 

Application  of  the  ZN  approach  becomes  questionable  at  very  low  rN  parameter  values.  In  accor¬ 
dance  with  the  classical  version  of  the  approach  [20],  at  the  boundary  of  the  loss  of  combustion 
stability  the  predicted  frequency  of  burning  rate  oscillations  Q  ~l/r n-  Therefore,  at  «  1  one 
has  value  £2  »  1  and  the  assumption  of  quasi-steadiness  of  gas  phase  would  not  be  satisfied. 
More  detailed  analysis  of  the  range  of  applicability  of  the  ZN  approach  is  presented  in  [37]. 

Historically,  transient  combustion  models  were  formulated  on  the  basis  of  simplified  versions  of 
steady-state  combustion  models.  The  reasons  were  both  the  difficulties  of  analytical  and  numeri¬ 
cal  solution  and  the  lack  of  physical/chemical  background  for  non-stationary  models.  As  a  result, 
theoretical  predictions  have  been  rather  approximate  and  weakly  substantiated.  At  the  same  time, 
there  are  urgent  practical  needs  to  improve  the  mathematical  simulation  of  transient  combustion 
processes  in  order  to  reliably  predict  the  combustion  dynamics  in  newly  designed  energetic  and 
propulsion  systems.  This  task  can  be  solved  on  the  basis  of  improvement  of  existing  quasi-steady 
approaches  as  well  as  elaboration  of  novel  comprehensive  transient  combustion  models. 

There  are  some  particular  problems  which  should  be  solved  for  further  development  of  transient 
combustion  theory.  One  of  the  most  important  is  the  identification  and  definition  of  the  con¬ 
densed  phase  chemical  reactions.  The  extent  of  condensed  phase  reaction  can  vary  during  tran¬ 
sient  combustion  and  one  needs  to  have  theoretical  or  experimental  information  to  define  the  time 


6-12 


varying  extent  of  reaction  properly.  It  is  recognized  that  a  unique  set  of  global  kinetic  parameters 
will  not  be  able  to  describe  both  steady  and  transient  combustion.  Multi-step  kinetic  mechanisms 
have  been  used  successfully  in  describing  the  gas  phase  combustion  of  monopropellants.  How¬ 
ever,  to  describe  the  condensed  phase,  the  knowledge  of  accurate  multi-step  kinetic  mechanisms 
is  not  available  at  this  time. 

A  significant  area  of  future  research  will  be  determining  detailed  kinetic  steps  in  the  condensed 
phase  process.  Another  problem  will  be  the  determination  of  reduced  kinetic  parameters  for  de¬ 
scribing  both  condensed  and  gas  phase  chemical  reactions,  which  will  adequately  describe  steady 
and  transient  combustion.  Special  kinetic  studies  should  be  conducted  to  determine  appropriate 
parameters  for  transient  and  self-sustaining  combustion. 

Highly  accurate  values  of  surface  temperature  and  burning  rate  are  required  to  be  determined  in 
time  and  labor  consuming  stationary  experiments  in  order  to  use  the  data  in  the  ZN  approach. 
However,  it  provides  only  approximate  values  of  the  parameters,  which  one  needs  to  use  for  tran¬ 
sient  combustion  modeling.  One  should  keep  in  mind  that  strictly  speaking  the  problem  formula¬ 
tion  (6. 2-6.4)  is  written  for  the  bulk  propellant  and  the  values  of  Ts  and  f  should  be  taken  at  the 
back  side  of  the  condensed  phase  reaction  zone.  Therefore  it  seems  more  justified  to  obtain 
needed  empirical  information  from  the  experiments  on  nonstationary  combustion  (that  is  also  not 
so  easy  to  do). 

The  example  of  such  an  approach  can  be  found  in  [26]  where  the  data  on  resonant  frequencies  of 
oscillatory  combustion  were  used  to  derive  effective  values  of  TS0(Tj)  and  the  parameters  rN  and  k. 
In  the  case  of  weakly  sounded  resonant  response  of  burning  system  the  regimes  with  programmed 
external  heating  or  other  well  characterized  transient  combustion  regimes  could  be  used  for  de¬ 
termining  experimental  information  which  one  needs  to  use  in  the  ZN  approach. 

The  development  of  modem,  fully  transient  combustion  models  needs  detailed  insight  into 
mechanism  of  chemical  reactions  in  both  the  condensed  and  gas  phases  as  well  as  information  on 
physical  processes  occuring  in  the  combustion  wave.  For  example,  the  processes  of  solid  melting 
and  dissolution  of  gaseous  decomposition  products  has  to  be  taken  into  account.  The  simple  idea 
[15]  of  pure  liquid  boiling  at  the  burning  surface  should  be  extended  to  multicomponent  mixture 
boiling  with  the  presence  of  chemical  reactions.  To  explore  the  chemical  mechanisms  of  com¬ 
bustion  it  is  promising  to  use  non-intrusive  time-resolved  spectroscopic  methods  [86]  in  conjunc¬ 
tion  with  measuring  the  instantaneous  burning  rate.  Obviously,  it  has  to  be  done  first  on  the  sim¬ 
plest  monopropellants  like  nitramines.  Further  it  could  be  extended  to  double  base  and  composite 
solid  propellants.  It  is  clear  that  the  development  of  modem  transient  combustion  models  takes 
significant  theoretical  efforts  and  essential  investments  in  experimental  techniques. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  experimental  study  of  ignition  and  combustion  transients  needs  to  be 
continued.  At  present,  there  are  no  ways  to  describe  a  priory  (on  the  basis  of  theoretical  knowl¬ 
edge  only)  the  physical  and  chemical  processes  in  the  nonstationary  combustion  wave.  Previous 
work  on  nonstationary  combustion  has  dealt  primarily  with  specified  parameters  or  critical 
events:  ignition  delay,  extinction  due  to  strong  disturbance  of  combustion  process,  etc.  In  order  to 
get  the  most  reliable  knowledge  in  transient  combustion  the  results  of  theoretical  simulations 


6-13 


should  be  compared  directly  with  experimental  observations  of  temporal  behavior  of  the  parame¬ 
ters  in  the  combustion  wave:  temperature  and  species  concentration  distributions,  and  burning 
rate  or  combustion  recoil  magnitudes. 

6.2.4.  Intrinsic  stability  of  self-sustaining  combustion  of  melted  energetic  materials 

When  studying  intrinsic  stability  of  EM  self-sustaining  combustion  [20],  the  phase  transition  in 
the  EM  combustion  wave  has  been  neglected.  However,  the  problem  may  be  easily  formulated  to 
take  account  of  phase  transition  within  the  framework  of  the  main  idea  of  phenomenological  ap¬ 
proach  [20]. 

Simple  consideration  of  all  existing  phase  transitions  in  EM  leads  to  very  cumbersome  expres¬ 
sions.  Let  us  take  advantage  of  the  fact  that  for  some  widely  used  EM  (such  as  RDX,  HMX)  the 
thermal  effect  of  melting  is  several  times  higher  than  the  sum  of  the  effects  due  to  change  in  the 
structure,  and  neglect  the  latter.  In  this  case,  similarly  to  classical  approach  [20],  one  may  deter¬ 
mine  the  limit  of  combustion  stability  at  constant  pressure  in  dependence  on  parameters  k  and  r. 
The  stability  limit  is  a  function  of  the  Q,  X  and  dm  parameters.  Convenient  definitions  are: 

k  =  (Ts  -  T0)  0  Inrt/dTo) p;  r  =  0TfdTo)p\ 

Qm  =  Qm/c(Ts  -  T0);  I  =  lSoi/  Xliq;  dm  =  (Tm  -  To)/(Ts  -  To) 


k

Figure  6.1  shows  the  stability  limit  at  X=l,  Qm  =  0.3  for  different  values  of  dm.  Stability  do¬ 
main  locates  above  the  solid  line.  The  calculated  stability  boundaries  are  between  two  "limiting" 
curves  A  and  B  for  all  k  values.  When  this  result  is  compared  with  that  of  the  "classical"  approach 
[20]  stating  limit  at  r  =  (k-l)2/(k+l),  it  becomes  obvious  that  melting  decreases  stability. 

The  result  obtained  for  relatively  small  values  of  k  and  r  is  important.  It  shows  the  possibility  of 
combustion  instability  for  melted  EM  at  k<l.  Note  that  according  to  Ref.  20  the  combustion 
without  melting  is  unambiguously  stable  at  k<l . 

Figure  6.2  shows  the  stability  limit  at  X  =  1,  dm  =  0.7  for  various  values  of  Qm.  =  0.7.  It  is  seen 
that  when  Qm  increases,  the  stability  boundary  shifts  to  the  left  of  basic  line  (Qm  =  0)  that  means 
that  a  domain  of  stable  combustion  becomes  smaller  in  size. 

A  general  character  of  the  dependence  of  the  stability  limit  position  on  the  Qm  and  dm  parame¬ 
ters  is  shown  in  Fig.  6.3  in  coordinates  k*  and  r,  where  k*=  (Ts  -  T0+Qm/c)  dlnrt/dT0=k(l+  Qm). 

With  this  coordinate  transformation  all  curves  originate  from  the  point  (1,  0).  It  is  seen  that  the 
smaller  the  dm  value  on  the  line  examined,  the  larger  the  distance  between  the  origin  of  coordi¬ 
nates  and  branching  from  the  basic  line  r=(k*-  l)2/(k*+l).  The  magnitude  of  curve  r(k*)  deviation 
from  the  basic  line  has  a  positive  dependence  on  Qm. 

The  observed  behavior  of  curves  has  a  simple  physical  meaning.  Note  that  the  temperature  profile 
in  the  bulk  of  condensed  phase  displays  peculiarity  due  to  phase  transition  only  starting  from  the 
distance  xm  from  the  burning  surface.  When  0<x<xm,  the  Mikhelson  profile  is  realized  in  the 
steady-state  regime  which  coincides  with  that  for  EM  without  phase  transitions  but  with  reduced 
initial  temperature  T0*  =  T0  -  Qm/c.  It  is  easy  to  calculate  that  xm=  [Xiiq/(rb  ciiqpiiq)]hi[(l+Qm)/05m 
+  Qm)]  Note  also  that  the  harmonic  thermal  perturbations  propagating  with  a  frequency  fo  in  the

bulk  of  EM  practically  decay  at  a  distance  xtf  ^  ( fo )° 5-

Obviously,  with  Xtf<xm  the  model  is  "insensitive"  to  phase  transitions.  For  EM  without  phase 
transitions  the  results  of  Ref.  20  are  hold.  Therefore,  with  Xtf<xm  the  stability  limit  coincides  with 
r=(k*-  l)2/(k*+l).  As  the  melting  temperature  decreases,  the  thickness  of  the  melted  layer  xm  in¬ 
creases.  To  preserve  the  equality  xm  =  Xtf,  the  branching  point  must  be  shifted  along  the  basic  line 
towards  the  lower  frequencies  (i.e.  far  from  the  origin  of  coordinates). 

Consider  now  the  case  of  fairly  low  perturbation  frequencies  when  the  characteristic  distance  of 
thermal  wave  decay  Xtf  becomes  larger  than  the  thickness  of  melted  layer  xm.  It  means  that  pertur¬ 
bations  reach  the  surface  of  phase  transition.  According  to  the  Le  Chatelier  principle  this  must 
strengthen  the  decay  of  perturbations  the  stronger,  the  larger  is  the  heat  of  the  phase  transition  As 
a  result,  it  leads  to  increase  of  stability  domain  at  dm  =  const  in  coordinates  r  and  k*=  k(l  +  Qm). 
This  result  reflects  a  dual  nature  of  the  effect  of  melting  heat  on  the  combustion  stability.  First  of 
all,  the  finite  value  melting  heat  leads,  at  arbitrary  melting  temperature,  to  decrease  of  stability 
domain  caused  by  effective  decrease  of  initial  temperature.  One  may  recognize  this  effect  in 
Figs.6.1  and  6.2,  when  analyzing  the  position  of  the  beginning  (r=0)  of  curves  A.  At  the  same 
time,  with  the  given  value  of  melting  temperature,  when  the  temperature  profile  oscillations  reach 
the  liquid-solid  interface,  the  melting  heat  acts  as  a  damper  and  plays  positive  role  in  increasing 
combustion  stability  in  plane  r  -  k*  (see  Fig.  6.3).  However,  this  does  not  change  overall  conclu¬ 
sion  about  total  negative  effect  of  melting  heat  on  the  combustion  stability  because  of  predomi¬ 
nant  influence  of  the  first  factor.  Note  that  calculations  at  r — >  0  (the  region  of  high  frequencies.

see  Figs.  6. 1-6.3)  require  special  analysis  in  order  to  take  into  account  finite  transition  times  in 
the  gas  phase  and  in  the  condensed  phase  reaction  zone  [87]. 


6.2.5.Analysis  of  different  phenomenological  models. 

Account  of  the  effect  of  irradiation.  The  simplest  generalization  [1,20]  is  made  for  the  problem 
statement  with  respect  to  condensed  phase  transparency.  Light  absorption  is  given  by  the  Beer 
law  and  a  corresponding  term  is  added  to  the  equation  of  condensed  phase  thermal  conductivity. 
Then,  the  procedure  is  performed  as  described  in  [1,20].  In  [87-89]  the  nonsteady-state  combus¬ 
tion  of  transparent  SP  under  the  action  of  radiant  flux  has  been  studied  theoretically  and  experi¬ 
mentally.  Under  real  conditions  of  SP  combustion  it  is  difficult  to  determine  a  portion  of  radiation 
absorbed  on  the  surface.  Nevertheless,  such  investigations  are  very  important.  The  available  SP 
components  include  the  substances  that  have  a  strong  nonstationary  effect  determined  by  their 
transparency.  For  instance,  according  to  [90],  this  it  tetryl  whose  inherent  flame  heats  the  con¬ 
densed  phase  at  p  >  8  atm  for  a  depth  exceeding  by  20  times  the  size  of  the  Michelson  preheat 
layer. 

Account  of  the  response  of  the  reaction  zone  in  the  condensed  phase.  In  some  papers  an  attempt 
was  made  to  take  into  account  the  characteristic  time  of  the  reaction  zone  in  the  condensed  phase. 
Indeed,  for  many  compositions  the  experimentally  measured  temperature  profile  in  the  condensed 
phase  differs  noticeably  from  the  Michelson  one,  probably,  due  to  relatively  wide  reaction  zones 
existing  in  the  condensed  phase  [91].  It  has  been  shown  [92]  that  this  effect  may  be  taken  into 
account  by  introducing  finite  value  delay  time  into  the  model  [20].  A  comparison  is  made  with 
the  model,  allowing  the  analytical  solution  in  which  the  heat  release  is  uniformly  distributed  over 
some  subsurface  layer  of  the  condensed  phase.  The  method  can  be  applied  to  real  SP  when  using 
one  nonstationary  experiment  to  calculate  the  needed  delay  time  and  applying  it  to  other  (arbi¬ 
trary)  laws  of  the  external  stimul  temporal  variations. 


In  the  similar  approach  papers  [93,94]  an  approximate  (in  the  framework  of  small  perturbations  it 
is  nonstationary)  solution  was  found  in  the  zone  of  chemical  reactions  of  the  condensed  phase  to 
the  temperature  and  concentration  of  nonreacting  substance.  The  difference  between  papers 
[93,94]  is  in  the  fact  that  the  former  uses  more  precise  approximate  solution  to  the  linearized 
problem  and  the  necessary  amount  of  boundary  conditions  (in  [93]  the  problem  is  overdeter¬ 
mined).  Both  of  the  works  have  two  shortcomings.  Firstly,  they  omit  one  of  the  parameters  de¬ 
termining  the  solution  in  the  zone  of  quasistationary  processes  (and  the  value  of  the  nonstationary 
combustion  rate).  Quasistationary  are  the  processes  occurring  in  the  gas  phase  and  in  the  thin  sub¬ 
surface  zone  of  the  condensed  phase  ( -s  <  x  <  0)  in  which  the  problem  could  not  be  reduced  to 
heat  propagation  and  to  the  global  reaction  with  the  Arrhenius  dependence  of  its  rate  W  on  tem¬ 
perature  T.  It  is  assumed  [93,94]  that  the  mass  burning  rate  m=m(p,  <p,  ps),  where  (p,  |3S  are  the 
temperature  gradient  and  the  portion  of  consumed  condensed  phase  with  x=-s.  This  relationship 
holds  only  for  the  reaction  running  without  any  changes  in  volume.  More  probable  is  the  assump¬ 
tion  of  the  gaseous  reaction  products,  escaping  from  the  condensed  phase  through  the  system  of 
pores  resulting  from  the  consumption  of  the  portion  of  condensed  phase  volume  by  reaction.  In 
this  case,  the  total  gas  flow  through  the  surface  x  =  -s 


Pgsvgs 


(6-7)

coincides  with  the  value  of  m(l-  ps)  only  under  steady-state  conditions,  which  follows  from  the 
equation  for  P 


nr  f 

W  =  -pc-^  =  -Pc 
at 


Thus,  one  should  take  into  account  the  dependence  of  the  processes  in  the  quasistationary  zone 
not  only  on  the  (1-  ps)  value  (the  porosity  at  the  surface)  but  also  on  the  parameter  (3g=PgSvgs/m 
which  can  not  be  reduced  to  (1  -  ps)  and  is  the  gas  portion  in  the  total  mass  flow  through  the  sur¬ 
face  x  =  -s.  Non-identity  of  Pg  and  (1-  ps)  is  the  main  effect  observed  for  the  transience  of  the 
condensed  phase  reaction  zone.  Taking  this  into  account,  we  get 

m=m(p,  (p,  ps,  pg)  (6.8) 

This  theory  flow  also  takes  place  in  [1 1,12]. 


The  second  shortcoming  is  the  incorrect  use  of  the  method  for  estimating  the  nonstationary  burn¬ 
ing  rate  from  the  "stationary"  empirical  dependencies.  The  method  was  formally  applied  as  de¬ 
scribed  in  [1,20].  The  correct  application  must  involve  the  following  logical  constructions:  the 
values  cp,  ps,  Pg  in  (6.8)  may  be  obtained  by  solving  the  nonstationary  problem  [95,96],  Thereafter, 
one  should  choose  the  m  value  from  the  empirical  dependencies,  i.e.  find  the  "stationary  experi¬ 
ment"  in  which  the  calculated  (p,  ps,  Pg  could  be  realized.  In  other  words, 

m0(T0,  p,  varl ,  var2)  =  m(p,  (p,  ps,  pg)  (6.9) 

The  arguments  of  the  function  in  the  right-hand  side  are  the  functions  of  those  in  the  left-hand 
side  derived  for  the  steady-state  regime  either  experimentally  or  theoretically,  as,  for  example 

M>=  cm°(Ts°-  To),  (6.10) 

where  the  dependencies  of  m°  and  Ts°  on  the  same  parameters  are  considered  known.  Actually, 
the  validness  of  expression  (6.9)  takes  the  equal  number  of  arguments  in  functions  on  both  sides 
of  equality.  Let  us  assume  that  we  have  managed  to  develop  the  method  for  measuring  the  values 
below 

Ps  =  Ps(T0,  p,  varl,  var2),  pg  =  pg(T0,  p,  varl,  var2)  (6.1 1) 

in  the  steady-state  regime.  To  find  m  using  the  calculated  values  of  (p,  ps  and  Pg  from  (6.9),  it  is 
necessary  to  know  the  values  of  the  arguments  of  the  right-hand  side  of  (3)  which  may  be  deter¬ 
mined  by  solving  the  system  of  three  equations  (6.9),  (6.11)  with  three  unknowns  T0,  varl,  var2. 
If  it  is  assumed  that  the  dependence  of  pg  in  (6.9)  is  insignificant  and  the  error  due  to  neglecting 
this  parameter  in  [93,94]  is  not  large,  the  two  remaining  independent  equations  must  correspond 
to  two  unknowns  T0,  varl.  Using  in  [93,94]  only  one  unknown  T0  indicates  a  silent  recognition  of 
the  dependence  between  (p  and  ps  and  "spoils"  the  problem  definition. 


To  solve  the  problem  formulated  in  [93,94]  correctly,  it  is  necessary  to  give  various  values  not 
only  to  p  and  T0  in  the  "stationary"  experiment  on  measurement  of  m,  Ts,  ps,  Pg  but  also  to  two 
other  (arbitrary)  parameters  varl  and  var2.  Varying  these  values  (either  separately  or  simultane¬ 
ously  or  even  in  combination  with  T0),  we  can  obtain  any  value  for  ps,  pg  from  some  two- 
dimensional  domain  of  the  variations  in  these  parameters.  It  is  difficult  to  name  the  changes  in  SP 
(composition,  technology)  which  should  be  introduced  at  p  =  const  and  cp  =  const  to  alter  ps  and 
not  to  distort  the  pattern  of  phenomena  on  the  surface  and  the  form  of  function  (6.9).  Besides,  it  is 
impossible  to  vary  Pg  with  (3S  =  const  because  in  the  steady-state  regime  Pg  +  Ps  =  1  • 


6-18 


Thus,  taking  into  account  the  characteristic  time  of  the  condensed  phase  reaction  zone  and  pre¬ 
serving  the  logical  scheme  [1,20],  gives  a  number  of  errors. 

Account  of  the  finite  response  time  in  the  gas  phase.  Some  works  [92,  8,  70,  71,  98-103]  were 
performed  to  estimate  the  influence  of  the  heat  propagation  characteristic  time  in  the  gas  phase. 
An  effort  was  made  [98]  to  take  into  account  the  eigenvalue  time  of  the  preheat  zone  in  the  gas 
phase  by  solving  the  problem  without  additional  (compared  to  [1,20])  assumptions  on  surface 
processes.  A  case  has  been  studied  where  the  unknown  processes  in  the  zones  of  gas  reactions 
and  gasification  (vaporization)  of  the  condensed  phase  near  the  burning  surface  (two  quasista¬ 
tionary  "black  boxes")  may  be  considered  quasistationary.  The  times  of  temperature  redistribution 
in  the  condensed  and  gas  phases  are  taken  into  account. 

The  empirical  dependence  of  the  stationary  combustion  rate  m0  on  pressure  p,  initial  temperature 
T0,  and  heat  flux  qs  absorbed  on  the  SP  surface  is  assumed  to  be  known.  It  is  shown  that  the  mass 
flow  rates  at  the  interface  ms  and  in  the  zone  of  gas  reactions  mg  must  depend  on  p,  cp,  qs  and  p, 
cpg,  \|t,  respectively,  where  cp  and  qs/X  are  the  temperature  gradients  at  the  "cold"  and  "hot"  ends  of 
the  condensed  phase  reaction  zone;  cpg  and  \|/  are  the  temperature  and  concentration  gradients  of 
the  active  component  in  the  reaction  zone  of  the  gas  phase.  The  cp,  qs,  (pg,  \|/  values  may  be  deter¬ 
mined  solving  corresponding  nonstationary  problems  in  the  zones  in  which  no  reactions  occur. 
The  dependences  of  ms  and  mg  on  these  parameters  which  are  also  hold  for  the  nonsteady-state 
regime,  should  be  obtained  similarly  to  [1,20],  by  taking  from  the  empirical  data  for  each  set  of 
parameters  the  steady-state  regime  that  has  needed  (from  calculations)  cp,  qs,  cpg,  \|/  values.  This  is 
impossible  in  a  given  approach  even  if  we  assume  that  in  the  "stationary  experiment"  qs  was 
changed  using  additional  thermal  sources  (e.g.,  laser).  The  case  is  that  the  "stationary  experi¬ 
ment"  is  sure  to  give  ms  =  mg  and  it  is  impossible  to  obtain  a  pair  of  ms  and  mg  values  in  the 
steady-state  regime  at  any  T0  and  qs  which  could  be  equal  to  that  in  the  nonsteady-state  regime. 

Nevertheless,  the  idea  proposed  in  [98]  seems  helpful  and  may  be  realized  in  a  reduced  form  if 
one  refuses  to  describe  phenomenologically  reaction  zone  in  the  gas  phase  (to  give  a  complete 
mathematical  description  of  the  gas  phase  as  in,  e.g.,  [8,  70,  71,  99-103]).  In  this  case  only  the 
subsurface  condensed  phase  zone  with  the  most  complex  and  almost  unknown  processes  is  de¬ 
scribed  phenomenologically.  If  one  assumes  that  the  gas  phase  has  a  purely  thermal  influence  on 
this  zone  (without  heterogeneous  reactions),  then  the  relationship  from  [98]  will  be  valid 

ms  =  ms(p,  (p,  qs)  (6.12) 

(otherwise,  the  expression  includes  the  concentration  of  the  active  gas  component  near  the  sur¬ 
face).  The  cp  value  (as  in  [8])  may  be  determined  solving  the  nonstationary  problems  of  heat 
propagation  and  diffusion,  and  the  quasistationary  dependence  (6.9)  may  be  found  from  experi¬ 
ments  with  varying  T0  and  qs.  Some  difficulties  can  be  connected  with  the  development  of  the 
technique  for  qs  identification  in  these  experiments  because  it  is  difficult  to  exclude  contribution 
of  heat  flux  from  the  flame  of  the  combustion  products. 

6.3.  NONSTATIONARY  COMBUSTION  OF  MELTED  QUASI-HOMOGENEOUS 
MATERIALS  WITH  FULLY  TRANSIENT  GAS  PHASE. 

It  is  known  fact  that  many  energetic  materials  (EM)  melt  in  a  combustion  wave  and  have  a  liquid 


6-19 


layer  on  the  burning  surface.  In  addition,  the  EM  may  change  their  crystal  structure  at  relatively 
low  temperature.  Typically,  in  stationary  combustion  modeling  the  effects  of  phase  changes  can 
be  taken  into  account  in  a  very  simple  way  by  introducing  the  effective  initial  temperature  calcu¬ 
lated  on  the  basis  of  heat  balance  at  the  burning  surface  [104, 105]. 

However,  when  modeling  transient  combustion,  it  is  not  clear  "a  priori"  if  the  effect  of  phase 
changes  can  be  explained  in  such  a  simple  way.  One  may  expect  that  transient  combustion  be¬ 
havior  of  EM,  at  least  near  the  limits  of  the  combustion  stability,  depends  on  the  heat  and  tem¬ 
perature  of  phase  transitions.  Obviously,  the  highest  effect  is  produced  by  evaporation  which  is 
localized  at  the  surface  of  the  condensed  phase  and  has,  as  a  rule,  largest  magnitude  of  the  latent 
heat.  In  the  past,  mainly  the  evaporation  was  considered  in  combustion  modeling.  Nevertheless,  it 
seemed  that  the  effect  of  another  phase  transitions  should  also  be  studied  and  attempts  to  explore 
this  problem  have  been  undertaken  in  recent  works.  It  was  shown  that  melting  or  phase  transition, 
whose  latent  heat  is  considerably  less  than  that  of  evaporation,  may  play  specific  role  in  radiation- 
driven  .combustion  [106]  as  well  as  in  intrinsic  stability  of  EM  combustion  [107, 108]. 

The  above  works  had  deal  mainly  with  analytical  approach  and  it  is  of  interest  to  investigate  nu¬ 
merically  the  combustion  behavior  of  melted  EM  in  transient  regimes  using  comprehensive 
mathematical  model.  Below  we  present  a  description  of  the  mathematical  model  along  with  the 
results  of  computations. 

6.3.1.  Mathematical  model 

General  description.  A  model  is  intended  to  describe  combustion  of  melted  and  evaporated  EM 
with  chemical  transformations  in  the  condensed  and  gas  phases.  Typical  representatives  of  such 
EM  are  nitramines,  as  well  as  newly  synthesized  oxidizers  like  ADN,  HNF,  etc. 

In  the  condensed  phase  the  model  considers  heat  propagation  in  solid  and  liquid  states  (heat  ca¬ 
pacity  and  density  are  taken  the  same  for  both  of  the  states  while  thermal  conductivity  coefficients 
for  solid  and  liquid  are  assumed  different);  melting  at  temperature  Tm  with  endothermal  effect 
Qm;  global  exothermic  reaction  of  decomposition  of  a  1st  order  in  the  liquid  phase  with  thermal 
effect  Quq;  radiation  absorption  in  the  bulk  of  condensed  phase  according  to  the  Beer  law,  qr  a 
exp(-a  x).  The  absorption  coefficient  a  is  taken  the  same  for  solid  and  liquid  material.  The  inter¬ 
face  between  solid  and  liquid  states  moves  through  condensed  phase  with  velocity  Vm. 

In  the  gas  phase  the  model  takes  into  account  heat  propagation,  diffusion  and  two  global  reactions 
with  thermal  effects  Qi,  i  =  1,2.  The  products  of  the  first  reaction  (vapor  decomposition  via  a  Ni 
order  kinetics,  mainly  of  a  first  order)  are  assumed  to  coincide  in  their  composition  with  the 
products  of  decomposition  of  the  liquid  phase.  The  second  reaction  generates  final  combustion 
products  via  a  N2  order  kinetics.  Reaction  routes  of  the  combustion  process  are  presented  by  the 
scheme: 

vapour 

liquid - >  intermediate  product - >  final  product 

The  choice  of  proper  reaction  scheme  is  a  very  complicated  task  and  still  has  no  sufficient  back¬ 
ground.  This  especially  concerns  the  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase.  Attempts  were  made  to 
formulate  reaction  scheme  consisting  of  several  (up  to  7)  global  reactions  [109,  110]  but  there  is 


still  no  real  justification  for  that.  Evidently,  when  using  global  reaction  approach  one  has  to  de¬ 
scribe  the  method  for  experimental  determination  of  kinetic  parameters. 

In  present  work  the  constants  for  condensed  phase  reaction  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  litera¬ 
ture  data  for  thermal  decomposition  of  nitramines  [111].  In  fact,  this  is  a  very  crude  estimate  be¬ 
cause  of  great  difference  in  heating  rate  for  combustion  and  thermal  decomposition  conditions.  In 
the  future  it  is  planning  to  get  needed  data  from  experiments  on  ignition  in  special  conditions  that 
provide  elimination  of  possible  effects  of  gas  phase  reactions. 

In  the  literature  several  detailed  schemes  for  flame  reactions  in  nitramines  combustion  [112-115], 
containing  more  than  40  species  and  more  than  200  steps,  can  be  found.  Using  of  such  schemes 
allows  in  principle  to  calculate  temperature  and  concentration  profiles  in  flame.  Unfortunately, 
use  of  detailed  reaction  schemes  causes  difficulties  in  calculation  of  transient  regimes  and  it  is 
reasonable  to  derive  reduced  kinetic  schemes  for  studying  dynamic  combustion  behavior.  This  is 
a  task  for  future  work.  At  the  same  time  the  global  kinetic  parameters  can  be  derived  from  treat¬ 
ment  of  experimental  data  of  combustion  of  melted  EM  in  well  characterized  conditions.  In  order 
to  do  that,  a  set  of  calculations  on  the  basis  of  model  should  be  performed.  As  a  first  estimate,  the 
data  for  thermal  decomposition  of  nitramines  vapor  and  reaction  between  their  products  were 
used  in  the  present  work  to  specify  magnitude  of  global  kinetic  parameters  for  gas  phase  reac¬ 
tions. 

Physical  state  of  the  condensed  phase.  Before  formulation  of  the  mathematical  model,  it  is  im¬ 
portant  to  discuss  physical  aspects  regarding  the  processes  in  the  bulk  and  on  the  surface  of  con¬ 
densed  phase.  Proceeding  of  chemical  reactions  in  the  bulk  of  condensed  phase  raises  questions 
on  effective  density  of  liquid  EM  and  on  evolution  of  gas  through  the  subsurface  layer.  It  is  natu¬ 
rally  to  assume  that  gaseous  decomposition  products  first  dissolve  in  the  liquid  layer  [116].  How¬ 
ever,  if  one  takes  into  consideration  an  equilibrium  solution  of  gas  in  the  liquid  material  this  cor¬ 
responds  to  negligibly  small  extent  of  EM  decomposition  in  the  condensed  phase  [117].  At  finite 
decomposition  extent  one  may  assume  that  the  gas  bubbles  form  in  the  liquid  layer.  Their  behav¬ 
ior  can  be  described  in  several  ways. 

First  description  was  suggested  in  1966  [118]  when  it  was  assumed  that  the  velocities  of  gas  and 
liquid  are  the  same,  V  =  VBq  =  m*pc.  Here  pc  =  (1-P)puq  +  Pp  is  the  effective  density  of  con¬ 
densed  phase.  More  detailed  analyses  of  two-phase  subsurface  layer  were  reported  in  [119-121], 
In  particular,  semi -empirical  expressions  were  suggested  [120]  in  general  case  for  linear  velocity 
of  gas  motion  V  =  (1-sP  +  s)  m*/p  and  liquid  motion  Vaq  =  (1-sP)  m*/piiq,  respectively.  Here  s  is 
the  matching  parameter  varying  in  the  range  from  zero  to  infinity  that  allows  to  describe  extreme 
cases  of  gas  release  from  subsurface  layer. 

In  the  present  model  we  consider  the  simplest  case  of  constant  density  over  the  liquid  layer.  This 
corresponds  to  the  case  of  gases  dissolved  in  liquid  without  formation  of  bubbles  or  the  case  of 
instantaneous  (V  -»  °o  and  s  — >  °°)  removal  of  gas  out  of  the  liquid  layer.  It  should  be  mentioned 
that  for  very  thin  layers  diffusion  is  also  able  to  provide  fast  removal  of  gas  from  liquid.  To  esti¬ 
mate,  let  us  assume  that  gaseous  products  start  to  evolve  in  the  bulk  of  EM  at  the  distance  from 
the  surface  equal  to  the  length  of  reaction  zone,  lCh  =  0.1  (X  /  Cp)uq/rb.  If  the  residence  time  for 


6-21 


liquid  in  the  reaction  zone,  Wrb  is  greater  than  the  diffusion  time  (lCh)2/D,  where  D  is  the  diffu¬ 
sion  coefficient,  the  bubbles  will  not  form.  The  above  condition  is  formulated  as  D(TS)  >  rb  lCh  = 
0.1  (k  f  Cp)iiq.  A  simple  estimate  shows  that  the  condition  is  approximately  hold  for  typical 
melted  EM  with  D  >  104  cm2/s  and  (A,  /  Cp)|jq  =  0.001  cm2/s. 

Detailed  consideration  of  the  effect  of  bubbles  on  the  heat  transfer  across  the  liquid  layer  due  to 
internal  evaporation  within  the  bubbles  and  of  the  Marangoni  and  Archimed  effects  was  not  made 
here.  The  matter  is  that  there  is  still  no  reliable  observations  of  foam  in  subsurface  liquid  layer  of 
burning  melted  EM.  Quite  the  contrary,  the  observations  were  reported  [122]  of  practical  absence 
of  developed  foam  at  the  burning  surface  of  double  base  propellants  at  atmospheric  and  elevated 
pressures  despite  the  presence  of  foam  at  the  surface  of  extinguished  samples.  Thus,  introduction 
of  bubbles  formation  into  comprehensive  combustion  models  has  to  be  justified  by  unambiguous 
experimental  findings.  One  of  the  ways  to  get  such  information  is  to  perform  high  speed  movie 
studies  of  EM  combustion  with  use  of  soft  X-ray  radiation  source. 

Surface  evaporation  condition.  As  already  mentioned,  according  to  the  model  conversion  of 
condensed  phase  into  gas  proceeds  by  the  way  of  chemical  reaction  and  evaporation.  The  latter 
can  be  precisely  described  in  terms  of  gas-kinetic  theory  if  one  calculates  the  mass  flow  rates  of 
evaporation  and  condensation.  Under  non  equilibrium  conditions,  corresponding  to  the  combus¬ 
tion  process,  the  difference  between  two  rates  gives  mass  burning  rate.  Such  approach  has  been 
employed  in  several  works  [112-114,  120],  however,  it  is  rather  difficult  to  use  this  approach  in 
real  calculations.  First  of  all,  there  is  no  reliable  knowledge  of  sticking  coefficient  which  charac¬ 
terizes  sticking  of  vapor  molecules  colliding  the  liquid/gas  interface.  Secondly,  and  most  impor¬ 
tant,  the  difference  between  two  rates  represents  difference  of  two  large  quantities  and  small  error 
in  their  calculation  leads  to  large  error  in  the  mass  burning  rate. 

Therefore,  in  the  present  model  we  use  another  description  based  on  the  fact  that  deviation  of 
partial  pressure  of  vapor  from  its  equilibrium  value  is  of  the  order  of  the  Mach  number  for  com¬ 
bustion  products  with  magnitude  of  this  number  being  much  less  than  unity.  Consequently,  as  it 
was  suggested  in  [123],  one  may  approximately  attribute  the  real  magnitude  of  the  vapor  pressure 
to  its  equilibrium  value  that  can  be  easily  calculated  on  the  basis  of  Clausius-Clapeyron  equation 
in  the  form: 

(M  /Mi)yis  p  =  const  exp(-L/RTs) 

Here  (M  /Mi)yis  is  the  mole  fraction  of  vapor  above  the  surface  and  p  is  the  ambient  pressure. 
Use  of  this  equation  provides  better  opportunity  for  convergence  of  iteration  process  in  numerical 
modeling.  Note  that  in  the  gas-kinetic  approach  the  equation  of  Clausius-Clapeyron  is  also  used 
for  calculating  the  equilibrium  pressure  of  vapor.  An  accuracy  of  these  calculations  directly  de¬ 
pends  on  the  accuracy  of  the  value  of  the  latent  heat  of  vaporization.  Unfortunately,  this  value  is 
known  for  real  EMs  with  rather  low  accuracy  because  of  partial  decomposition  of  EMs  at  rela¬ 
tively  high  temperatures.  The  heat  of  vaporization  can  be  calculated  [124]  on  the  basis  of  semi- 
empirical  expressions  or  determined  by  extrapolation  of  data  of  surface  temperature  measure¬ 
ment. 

Problem  formulation.  Let  us  choose  a  movable  coordinate  system  (x,t)  attached  to  the  burning 
surface  (positive  x-axis  is  directed  in  the  bulk  of  condensed  material)  and  derive  the  system  of

The  condensed  phase  generates  vapor  and  a  combustible  gas.  Thus,  there  are  3  components  in  the 
gas  phase:  vapor,  intermediate  decomposition  product,  and  final  combustion  product.  The  tem¬ 
perature  of  the  components  is  uniform  at  the  given  point  of  space.  The  system  of  equations  for  the 

gas  phase  is  as  follows  (xL  <  x  <  0):

Numerical  method.  The  equations  of  energy  and  species  concentrations  in  the  gas  phase  include 
convective  and  diffusive  terms.  It  is  known  that  there  exist  computational  difficulties  in  their  so¬ 
lution  when  using  central-difference  schemes  for  convective  term.  Another  difficulty  is  the  stiff¬ 
ness  of  equations.  To  overcome  difficulties  a  quasi  monotonous  difference  scheme  of  second- 
order  accuracy  has  been  developed  that  effectively  operates  on  real  difference  grids.  Its  essence 
may  be  explained  taking  as  an  example  the  model  nonlinear  equation  for  a  scalar  function  <|)  in  the 
domain  {0<x<l;  0<t<T}. 

d(()/dt  +  ud(J)/3x  =  a  d2(|)/dx2  +  f((f),  t)  (6.13) 

where  u  is  the  velocity;  a  is  the  constant,  f(<J),  t)  is  the  source  term.  The  use  of  approximation 
dty/dx  «  (<[)i+in+1  -  <t>i.in+1)/(2h)  for  the  convective  term  leads  to  the  fact  that  the  nonphysical  oscil¬ 
lations  appear  in  the  numerical  solution  in  the  range  of  sharp  change  of  value  0.  For  a  given  class 
of  problems  this  corresponds  usually  to  the  reaction  zone  where  the  temperature  and  concentra¬ 
tion  gradients  are  high  enough.  To  eliminate  these  oscillations  one  may  apply  a  difference  scheme 
based  on  "hyperbolic"  approximation.  To  this  end  we  wrote  the  left-hand  side  of  Eq.  (6.13)  along 
line  dx/dt  =  u  that  is  conventionally  called  the  characteristic  line  and  constructed  the  following 
nonlinear  two-step  difference  scheme  with  using  backward  Tailor-series  expansion  of  term  f((j),  t) 
in  time:

Here  x,  h  are  the  grid  steps  over  spatial  and  time  variables  so  that  t  =  nx;  x  =  ih;  n  =  0,...,  1/h; 
i=0,...,  T/x.  The  values  with  subscript  *  are  calculated  using  appropriate  interpolations  at  the 
cross-points  of  the  characteristic  lines  starting  from  the  point  (n+l,i)  with  the  straight  lines  form¬ 
ing  the  difference  grid  (with  the  horizontal  ones  at  h/x  >  u  and  with  the  vertical  ones  at  h/x  <  u).

The  nonlinear  difference  scheme  (6.14)-(6.15)  can  be  easily  solved  by  the  Newton  method. 

Coming  back  to  the  solution  of  original  problem  formulation,  the  following  procedure  has  been 
used.  The  surface  temperature  Ts  and  the  burning  rate  rb  were  found  via  inner  iteration  procedure 
at  each  time-marching  step.  For  a  given  initial  guess  of  Ts  and  rb  the  equations  for  species  con¬ 
centrations  were  solved.  Then  values  yis,  y2S  and  yiiq,s  were  used  to  determine  the  boundary  con¬ 
ditions  for  the  energy  equations  in  the  gas  and  condensed  phase.  After  solution  of  the  energy 
equations  new  values  of  Ts  and  rb  were  found  from  boundary  conditions.  The  inner  loop  was  re¬ 
peated  down  to  the  convergence  of  Ts  and  rb.  A  variable  step  grid  condensed  in  vicinity  of  the  liq¬ 
uid/gas  interface  was  used  to  get  the  results  with  0.1%  accuracy. 

In  order  to  solve  numerically  the  problem  with  closing  initial  and  boundary  conditions  a  spatial 
domain  xL  <  x  <  xR  has  to  be  chosen  on  the  basis  of  physical  considerations  or  numerical  experi¬ 
ment.  The  domain  size  should  allow  to  establish  zero  gradients  of  temperature  and  species  con¬ 
centrations  on  the  boundaries.  For  the  gaseous  mixture  (vapor,  intermediate  and  final  products, 
indices  1,  2,  and  3  respectively)  the  corresponding  diffusion  coefficients  were  calculated  using  the 
Wilke  formula  1/Di  =  yi/E>ii  +  y2/Di2  +  y3/Di3.  Values  of  Dik  were  calculated  using  the  Lennard- 
Jones  potential  with  (e/k)i  =  436  K,  (e/k)2  =  =  244  K,  (e/k)3  =  97  K;  Oi  =  6  A,  a2  =  3.7  A,  a3  =  3.6 
A.  The  thermal  conductivity  and  specific  heat  of  gaseous  mixture  were  calculated  by  the  formulas 
X  =  Aiyi  +  X2y2  +  As  (l-yi-y2),  C  =  Ciyi  +  c2y 2  +  c3(l  -  yi  -  y2),  X-t  =  An  +  B^T,  Cj  =  Aci  +  BciT,  Axi  =

6.3.2.  Burning  rate  response  to  variations  in  pressure. 

It  is  important  from  a  practical  point  of  view  to  predict  the  EM  combustion  behavior  under  pres¬ 
sure  variations  in  order  to  estimate  the  possible  growth  of  acoustic  oscillations  in  the  combustion 
chamber.  The  burning  rate  responses  have  been  calculated  for  reference  parameters  selected  ac¬ 
cording  to  published  data  [109-112]  and  with  provision  of  coincidence  with  experimental  data  on 
RDX  burning  rate  over  the  pressure  range  1-90  atm.  The  reference  parameters  are  listed  in  Table 
below.

The  calculated  results  for  Rp  =  (Arb  /  rb)  /  (Ap/p)  at  pressure  70  atm  are  presented  in  Fig  6.4.  It  is 
seen  that  the  magnitude  of  maximum  of  pressure  driven  burning  rate  response  function  decreases 
with  increase  of  melting  temperature  and  corresponding  decrease  of  the  melted  layer  width. 
Qualitative  explanation  of  such  behavior  can  be  done  in  a  following  way.  According  to  the  Le 
Chatelier  principle  a  phase  transition  (melting)  diminishes  an  amplitude  of  oscillations  of  thermal 
profile  but  it  works  only  at  frequencies  not  exceeding  certain  limiting  value.  The  lower  the  melt¬ 
ing  temperature,  the  wider  melted  layer  and  the  lower  limiting  frequency.  The  reason  why  the 
curve  1  in  Fig  6.4  has  relatively  small  maximum  is  that  the  melted  layer  is  very  narrow  at  Tra  = 
580  K. 

Comparison  of  curves  2  and  3  indicates  that  increase  of  melting  heat  leads  to  the  loss  of  combus¬ 
tion  stability  that  is  in  agreement  with  the  results  of  analysis  of  intrinsic  combustion  stability. 

Analyzing  Fig.  6.4  one  may  recognize  that  behavior  of  burning  rate  response  function  at  high  fre¬ 
quencies  does  not  follow  classical  pattern  with  diminishing  the  response  function  magnitude  to 
infinitely  small  value.  Instead,  it  is  seen  that  response  function  reaches  at  high  frequencies  some 
finite  magnitude.  Similar  result  was  reported  earlier  in  Ref.  125  for  the  common  case  when  one 


6-26 


does  not  use  an  assumption  of  existence  of  unambiguous  correlation  between  surface  temperature 
and  burning  rate.  Simple  qualitative  explanation  of  the  result  discussed  follows  from  the  theory  of 
heat  propagation  that  states  that  the  amplitude  of  oscillations  of  surface  temperature  diminishes  to 
zero  at  high  frequencies  of  oscillating  heat  feedback  to  the  solid.  In  the  case  when  the  relationship 
rb  =  rb(Ts)  is  hold,  this  leads  to  diminishing  the  amplitude  of  oscillations  of  burning  rate.  How¬ 
ever,  in  common  case  when  such  correlation  does  not  exist  the  finite  amplitude  oscillations  of  rb 
at  high  frequencies  are  possible. 

6.3.3.  Stability  of  radiation  driven  gasification  regimes 

Gasification  is  externally  stimulated  combustion  under  thermal  radiation  when  the  absorbed  radi¬ 
ant  heat  flux  is  much  greater  than  the  heat  feed  back  to  the  surface  from  the  gas  phase.  The  gasifi¬ 
cation  regimes  are  rather  uncommon  for  EM  application  but  they  can  be  effectively  used  for 
studying  combustion  mechanism.  Strong  irradiation  leads  to  high  gasification  velocity  and  to  de¬ 
tachment  of  gas  flame  from  surface.  The  gas  flame  can  be  completely  eliminated  (e.g.,  in  pres¬ 
ence  of  heat  sink  in  the  gas  phase)  so  that  the  process  of  combustion  results  from  the  interaction 
between  radiation  and  physicochemical  conversion  of  the  condensed  phase.  In  this  case  the  de¬ 
termining  factors  are  the  radiation  absorption,  thermal  conductivity,  melting,  the  exothermic  re¬ 
action  of  decomposition,  and  evaporation.  This  process  is  easier  to  describe  than  the  complete 
model  which  includes  the  gas  flame.  The  gasification  regimes  make  it  possible  to  get  information 
on  the  global  chemical  reactions  in  the  condensed  phase.  This  information  may  be  obtained  by 
comparing  experimental  and  calculated  data  on  the  specific  behavior  of  the  process,  in  particular, 
the  regression  pattern  in  critical  conditions.  We  consider  below  the  numerical  data  which  testify 
to  the  existence  of  critical  gasification  conditions  in  the  form  of  the  lower  and  upper  (in  terms  of 
the  magnitude  of  radiant  flux  qr)  limits  of  existence  of  steady-state  gasification  regimes. 

Reference  data  for  calculations:  p  =  1  atm,  Qm  =  25  and  60  cal/g,  Tm  =  480  K,  A,uq=  0.00095 
cal/(cm  s  K).  The  other  parameter  values  are  the  same  as  listed  in  section  6.3.2. 

The  above  parameters  correspond  to  the  literature  data  on  the  RDX  condensed  phase.  Calcula¬ 
tions  have  shown  that  for  the  given  value  of  radiation  absorption  coefficient  a  and  for  fixed  other 
parameters  the  steady-state  gasification  regimes  exist  in  the  limited  (on  both  sides)  range  of  qr 
variations,  i.e.  there  are  low  and  upper  limits  for  qr  which  depend  on  the  value  of  Qm  (see  Fig.6.5). 

The  domain  of  stable  gasification  is  situated  above  the  corresponding  curve  Qm  =  const.  An  in¬ 
crease  in  melting  heat  Qm  extends  the  domain  of  stability.  The  cause  is  that  instability  is  due  to 
thermal  explosion  but  increasing  of  Qm  magnitude  (equal  to  decreasing  of  To)  hinders  the  thermal 
explosion.  The  simple  theory  for  the  left  branches  is  given  in  [125],  for  the  right  branches  it  is 
given  below. 

Let  us  prove  analytically  the  existence  of  the  upper  gasification  limit  for  (RTS2/E)A,  /qr<l/a.  For 
simplicity,  we  consider  only  the  case  where  Qm  =  0.  The  method  of  the  matched  asymptotic  ex¬ 
pansions  is  applied  according  to  which  the  “internal”  problem  (upon  neglection  by  nonstationary 
and  convective  terms  in  the  energy  conservation  equation)  takes  the  form:

Tmax  is  unknown,  xmax  is  assumed  to  be  coincided  with  the  maximal  overheating  point  in  the  "in¬

The  temperature  has  a  maximum:

oo5  a  minimum  must  exist.  A  critical  condition  for  the  thermal  explosion  corresponds  to  the  con¬ 
tact  of  lines  q+(dmax)  and  q-(fW)  described  by  the  conditions  q+  =  q.  and  dq+  /  d(0max)  =  dq.  / 
dO&maX).  In  dependence  on  the  values  of  qr  and  other  parameters  the  lines  q+  and  q.  may  have  2 
points  of  interrection.  At  high  values  of  initial  temperature  and  qr  there  is  no  interrection  point 
and  there  is  no  steady  state  gasification  regime. 

6.3.4.  Stability  of  transient  combustion  under  pressure  drop  and  pulse  of  radiant  flux. 

The  EM  combustion  behavior  have  been  studied  upon  transition  from  the  regime  at  given  con¬ 
stant  pressure  pi  to  that  at  lower  constant  pressure  p2.  The  pressure  change  occurs  during  time 
interval  At  (which,  in  particular,  may  be  assumed  equal  zero)  with  pressure  being  linearly  de¬ 
pendent  on  time.  The  values  of  EM  parameters  in  these  calculations  were  chosen  the  same  as  in 
the  calculations  of  burning  rate  response  to  p  variations.  For  fairly  low  levels  of  final  pressure  p2 
and/or  short  At  one  may  observe  extinction  rather  than  transition  to  a  new  combustion  regime. 

The  extinction  boundary  was  obtained  (Fig.6.7)  at  a  given  pi  in  the  At  and  P2  coordinates  by  a  se¬ 
ries  of  calculations.  Transition  to  a  new  combustion  regime  is  realized  above  this  curve  and  ex¬ 
tinction  occurs  below  it.  The  calculations  indicate  that  the  transition  stability  decreases  (and  fi¬ 
nally  one  may  reach  extinction)  either  with  decreasing  melting  temperature  Tm  or  with  increasing 
thermal  effect  of  phase  transitions  Qm.

Burning  rate  response  to  the  pulse  of  radiant  flux  was  studied  without  taking  into  account  reac¬ 
tions  in  the  condensed  phase  and  with  gas  phase  exothermic  reactions  controlling  the  EM  burning 
rate.  The  input  parameters  were  chosen  as  follows:  p=latm,  Agi=108'85  g/(cm3s  atm16),  Ag2=  1010 
g/(cm3s  atm1'5),  D=0.15  cm2/s,  Xgas  =  0.0002  cal/(cm  s  K).  Other  parameters  were  taken  as  listed 
in  section  6.3.2.  The  burning  surface  was  irradiated  during  0.1  s  with  heat  flux  10  cal/(cm2s).  Fig¬ 
ure  6.8  gives  the  calculated  results  which  show  that  the  stability  of  transient  combustion  depends 
on  the  melting  heat  magnitude. 


6-30 


It  is  seen  from  Figs.  6.8  (a,  b,  c)  that  increase  in  melting  heat  up  to  rather  moderate  value  20  cal/g 
leads  to  drastical  change  in  combustion  behavior  of  EM  subjected  to  pulsed  irradiation.  Note  that 
the  magnitudes  of  the  parameter  k  =  (Ts  -  T0)  (d  lnrf/dT0)p,  corresponding  to  the  burning  EM  in 
Figs.  6.8  a  and  (6.8  b,  6.8  c),  are  equal  to  0.46  and  0.48,  correspondingly.  It  means  that  the  stabil¬ 
ity  of  self-sustaining  combustion  of  these  EM  is  expected  to  be  high  and  observed  transient  com¬ 
bustion  behavior  is  governed  mainly  by  the  heat  sink  in  the  subsurface  layer  of  EM.  Figure  6.8  c 
shows  that  the  increase  in  melting  temperature  leads  to  increase  in  stability  of  transition  to  self- 
sustaining  combustion  after  ceasing  the  irradiation.  This  effect  is  qualitatively  similar  to  that  in 
case  of  combustion  response  to  oscillating  heat  flux.

6.3.5.  Ignition  peculiarities. 

The  ignition  of  EM  by  thermal  radiation  was  modeled  as  follows.  For  semi-transparent  EM  (a  = 
1000  cm"1  in  terms  of  the  Beer  law)  we  assumed  time-dependent  irradiation  by  flux  qr(t)  which  is 
constant  qr=qo  within  the  time  interval  0<t<ti,  linearly  decreases  to  zero  with  ti<t<t2  and  at  last 
vanishes.  It  appears  that  depending  on  the  value  of  parameters  qo,  ti,  t2  and  kinetic  parameters 
(for  the  gas  phase,  first  of  all)  possible  are  one-,  two-  or  even  three-stage  ignition  regimes.  All 


6-31 


regimes  have  the  same  beginning  phase,  i.e.  "inert"  heating  when  all  reactions  can  be  neglected. 
This  phase  continues  until  the  surface  temperature  reaches  the  EM  boiling  (a  bit  lower)  tempera¬ 
ture  Tb.  When  Ts  approaches  Tb,  noticeable  are  the  rates  of  evaporation  from  the  surface  and  re¬ 
actions  in  the  liquid  and  gas. 

To  demonstrate  the  effects  of  multi-stage  ignition  the  calculations  were  conducted  with  following 
reference  parameters:  Qbq  =  102  cal/g,  Ei  =  E2  =  35400  cal/  mol,  Qi  =  250  cal/g,  Q2  =  716  cal/g, 
Agi  =  1014  g/(cm3  s  atm1,6)  and  Ag2  =  1013  5  g/(cm3  s  atm1'6)  for  Figure  6.9;  Agi  =  Ag2  =  1013  5 
g/(cm3  s  atm16)  for  Figure  6.10;  Agi  =  10135  g/(cm3  s  atm16)  and  Ag2  =  10123  g/(cm3  s  atm16)  for 
Figure  6.11. 

One-stage  ignition  is  realized  with  sufficiently  strong  heat  release  of  reactions  in  the  gas  phase, 
in  the  time  interval  0  <t  -  ti  (Figure  6.9).  The  gas  flame  is  stabilized  in  close  vicinity  of  surface 
and  provides  heating  and  evaporation  of  the  condensed  phase.  When  the  qr  gradually  vanishes, 
the  steady-state  regime  of  self-sustaining  combustion  can  be  established,  if  the  deradiation  time 
(t2-ti)  is  not  much  shorter  than  the  characteristic  relaxation  time  of  preheat  layer  in  this  regime  (in 
opposite  case  the  flame  quenches).  In  self-sustaining  regime  a  regression  rate  is  relatively  high, 
conversion  degree  in  liquid  is  small, 
rb  Ts  0.24  qr 


Two-stage  regime  is  possible  (Figure  6.10)  with  relatively  slow  kinetics  of  the  first  gas  phase  re¬ 
action.  The  gas  flame  arises  when  the  Ts  =  Tb  and  evaporation  starts.  However,  the  flame  is  real¬ 
ized  in  the  "zone  separation  regime",  i.e.  far  from  the  surface  at  a  distance  h  =  Vgtign.  In  this  case 
Vg  ~  qr  is  the  velocity  of  gas  flowing  from  the  surface;  hgn  is  the  time  of  thermal  explosion  in  gas 
at  characteristic  temperature  Ts.  When  h>A/(cp  Vg),  the  heat  from  gas  flame  does  not  effectively 
feed  to  the  surface.  In  these  conditions  the  gasification  regime  is  observed  presumably  under  the 
action  of  the  external  heat  flux  qr.  When  qr  decreases,  the  degree  of  conversion  in  the  condensed 
phase  increases  (for  used  reference  parameters  it  reaches  ~  0.2),  and  rb  decreases  too.  With  qr(t) 
decreasing,  the  gas  velocity  and  distance  h  also  decrease  and  the  flame  approaches  the  surface. 
When  qr  vanishes,  the  flame  provides  the  heat  flux  to  the  surface  that  is  necessary  for  the  steady- 
state  self-sustaining  regime  (if  deradiation  was  not  too  fast).  In  this  case,  the  mass  fraction  of  va¬ 
por  above  the  surface  yJs,  which  in  the  zone  separation  regime  of  combustion  or  in  gasification 
regime  coincides  with  ycs,  becomes  smaller  due  to  the  diffusion  dilution  of  vapor  by  combustion 
products  that  leads  to  a  small  drop  in  Ts.  As  a  result,  the  value  of  (l-ycs)  decreases  compared  to 
gasification  regime.

Figure  6.11.  Three-stage  ignition  (qo=105  W/cni2,  ti=0.07  s,  t2=0.17  s). 

Three-stage  regime  is  possible  (Figure  6.11)  with  fairly  "slow"  kinetics  of  the  second  reaction  in 
the  gas  phase  (burning  in  a  far  zone).  In  this  case,  at  the  first  stage  in  the  gasification  regime  the 
gas  flame  of  the  first  reaction  is  separated  from  the  surface  and  from  the  flame  of  the  second  re¬ 
action  in  a  far  zone.  As  qr  decreases,  the  flame  in  a  far  zone  approaches  the  first  flame  and  merges 
with  it.  Finally,  the  merged  flame  approaches  the  surface. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  regime  of  the  flameless  gasification  under  irradiation  by  Nd-YAG  laser 
was  experimentally  observed  in  combustion  under  atmospheric  pressure  of  pressed  RDX  samples. 
Experiments  were  conducted  in  1998  in  the  Institute  of  Chemical  Kinetics  and  Combustion,  No¬ 
vosibirsk. 

6.3.6.  Concluding  remarks 

The  above  results  show  that  the  effect  of  melting  on  the  combustion  behavior  of  EM  can  be 
qualitatively  explained  from  the  point  of  view  of  classic  thermal  theory  of  combustion.  If  one  as¬ 
sumes  that  increase  in  absolute  value  of  the  melting  heat  is  equivalent  to  decrease  of  initial  tem¬ 
perature  of  EM,  the  observed  decrease  of  intrinsic  combustion  stability  in  response  to  small  or 
finite  pulse  perturbations  of  heat  flux  is  the  result  of  lowering  the  effective  initial  temperature. 
The  influence  of  initial  temperature  on  the  combustion  stability  limit  is  determined  by  the  close¬ 
ness  of  calculated  value  of  the  parameter  k  =  (Ts  -  T0)  ( dlnrt!dT0)v  to  its  critical  value  corre¬ 
sponding  to  the  boundary  of  stable  combustion  regimes.  In  the  case  of  gas  phase  reactions  con- 


6-33 


trolling  the  propellant  burning  rate  the  coefficient  dlnrtJdT,,  ~  Eg/RTg2  has  a  weak  dependence  on 
T0  and  parameter  k  increases  when  initial  temperature  T0  decreases.  Thus,  with  T0  decreasing  the 
combustion  stability  becomes  lower  due  to  increase  of  parameter  k.  Such  statement  works  in  case 
of  small  perturbations  and  may  work  in  case  of  finite  amplitude  perturbations. 

The  effect  of  the  magnitude  of  melting  temperature  on  the  combustion  stability  can  be  qualita¬ 
tively  treated  through  the  analysis  of  interaction  of  thermal  disturbances  with  melting  surface. 
When  the  thermal  wave  penetrates  deep  in  the  bulk  of  EM  and  reaches  the  melting  surface,  the 
interaction  with  the  heat  sink  caused  by  the  EM  melting  leads  to  the  weakening  (dissipation)  of 
thermal  disturbance  as  it  follows  from  the  Le  Chatelier  principle.  Therefore,  the  higher  the  melt¬ 
ing  temperature  (closer  to  the  burning  surface  temperature),  the  higher  the  stability  of  self- 
sustaining  and  transient  combustion  both  in  the  regimes  of  pressure  drop  and  irradiation  pulse. 

Calculations  within  the  framework  of  the  proposed  mathematical  model  for  combustion  of  melted 
and  evaporated  EM  showed  that  variations  of  the  surface  temperature  are  effectively  reduced  by 
the  surface  heat  sink  created  by  EM  evaporation.  This  leads  to  relatively  small  magnitude  of  pa¬ 
rameter  r  =  {dT/dT0\  and  to  relatively  weak  frequency  dependence  of  burning  rate  response  to 
pressure  oscillations.  It  should  be  noted  that  such  theoretical  predictions  still  have  no  actual  con¬ 
firmation  in  experiments. 

6.4.  NONSTEADY-STATE  COMBUSTION  OF  METALLESS  HETEROGENEOUS 
COMPOUNDS 

6.4.1.  Combustion  of  coarse  grain  oxidizer  in  active  binder. 

In  view  of  the  extraordinary  variety  of  heterogeneous  condensed  systems  (HCS)  and  their  com¬ 
bustion  conditions  it  is  only  possible  to  describe  the  combustion  of  HCS  plausibly  by  a  system  of 
the  models.  While  in  steady-state  combustion  several  elements  of  this  system  are  known,  in  non¬ 
steady-state  combustion,  where  the  variety  of  combustion  conditions  is  much  higher,  in  different 
variants  mainly  a  model  is  used  assuming  that  d«  k/u  (d  is  the  particle  size;  K  is  the  condensed 
phase  thermal  diffusivity;  u  is  HCS  burning  rate).  Another  important  assumption  used  is  about 
one-dimensional  heat  propagation  process.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  clear  that  with  d  >  k/u,  when 
burnout  time  d/u  for  a  single  particle  and  the  time  k/u2  for  thermal  relaxation  of  the  preheated 
HCS  layer  are  comparable,  combustion  of  a  system  may  be  locally  nonstationary  [126,  127].  The 
nature  of  disturbances  caused  by  heterogeneity  may  be  different. 

If  gasification  products  of  one  of  the  components  (dispersed  filler  or  binder),  issued  with  a  veloc¬ 
ity  v  from  the  surface,  flows  around  projections  of  the  other  less  volatile  component  rising  by  ~d 
above  it,  then  with  Re  =  pvd/p  ~  10  it  is  possible  for  pulsations  to  occur  as  a  result  of  the  detach¬ 
ment  of  Karman  vortices  with  the  frequency  ~v/d.  If  the  binder  bums  independently  and  more 
rapidly  than  the  filler,  the  role  of  the  latter  for  a  broad  class  of  HCS  is  reduced  to  heat  transfer 
from  the  combustion  zone  of  the  binder  [128].  With  a  reduction  in  thickness  h  of  the  binder  layer 
between  filler  grains  (with  an  increase  in  its  volume  fraction  q,  in  HCS  or  with  a  reduction  in  d) 
combustion  of  the  binder  slows  down,  and  on  reaching  a  critical  thickness  h*  it  ceases  as  a  result 
of  extinction  of  the  gas  flame,  as  demonstrated  in  tests  in  [129]  with  DB  propellant  specimens.  In 
many  cases  according  to  [91]  homogeneous  DB  propellant  specimens  with  a  thickness  close  to 


6-34 


the  critical  value  bum  in  oscillating  regime.  The  same  behavior  may  also  be  expected  for  layers  of 
rapidly  burning  binder  in  HCS. 

Finally,  with  h  »  h*,  when  the  greater  part  of  the  binder  and  filler  surfaces  bum  in  dependently  of 
each  other,  nonstationary  combustion  of  HCS  under  transient  pressure  is  determined  by  the  evo¬ 
lution  of  the  filler  surface  area  that  leads  to  variation  of  the  mass  flow  rate  of  the  system  compo¬ 
nents.  Let  pressure  changes  system  with  the  fast  burning  filler  components. 

Combustion  under  fast  changing  ambient  pressure.  Let  pressure  changes  with  a  high  rate.  If  the 
time  for  change  in  pressure  tp  «  d/um  ( um  =  max(u„,  Ub);  uH  and  Ub  are  linear  combustion  rate  for 
the  filler  and  binder,  respectively),  then  it  is  possible  to  ignore  the  change  in  HCS  surface  struc¬ 
ture  during  interval  time  tp.  According  to  [11],  a  HCS  specimen  of  cross  section  S  bums  as  two 
independently  burning  specimens  (of  solid  filler  and  of  binder)  with  a  plane  combustion  surface 
(Sox  =  S°ox,  Sb  =  S°b),  with  the  "steady-state"  relationships  being  met: 

S°ox  u°ox  =  q  S  u°,  S°b  u°b=  (1-q)  S  u°, 

where  u°  is  the  steady-state  (before  the  start  of  change  in  pressure)  burning  rate  for  the  whole 
specimen.  The  only  difference  consists  of  the  fact  that  the  mass  flow  rates  calculated  by  formulas 

M  ox  =  S  ox  p0x  U0x(t),  M  b  =  S  b  Pb  Ub(t) 

for  the  two  components  should  assume  instantaneously  mixing  at  the  HCS  surface.  The  variabil¬ 
ity  of  Mox(t)/Mb(t)  causes  a  change  in  temperature  of  the  combustion  products.  These  variations 
(by  hundreds  of  degrees)  have  been  recorded  in  experiments  [11, 13, 130], 

System  with  fast  burning  filler  component.  Some  predictions  for  relatively  nonsteady-state 
combustion  may  also  be  carried  out  for  the  case  d/uox«  tp,  uox  »  Ub  when  the  corresponding 
steady-state  regime  is  described  by  models  of  a  relay  the  type  [131-134],  For  such  a  steady-state 
regime  from  a  model  in  [133]  it  follows  that  u  =  Ub/(i  -  qeff).  Here  qeff  =  q/qi  is  the  effective  volume 
fraction  of  rapidly  burning  component  considering  that  with  each  filler  particle  there  is  a  certain 
volume  of  binder,  adjacent  to  it,  that  also  bums  out  rapidly.  The  condition  adopted  d/uox«tp 
means  that  a  change  in  the  process  parameters  (in  particular  composition  of  the  combustion  prod¬ 
ucts)  is  only  considered  in  intervals  of  time  essentially  exceeding  the  time  for  bum  out  of  a  single 
filler  grain.  Filler  gasification  products  issuing  from  the  surface  of  a  HCS  specimen  in  such  time 
intervals  depend  on  the  slow  gasification-rate  for  binder  layers  between  particles.  This  statement 
is  a  basis  for  deriving  a  "steady-state"  equation  u  «  Ub/(i  -  qeff).  In  other  words,  if  it  is  possible  to 
ignore  the  effect  of  non-uniformity  in  the  gas  phase  and  assume  that  the  value  of  qi  is  constant,  in 
the  nonsteady-state  regime  described  the  ratio  Mox/Mb  does  not  change  (and  T  depending  upon  it), 
and  the  overall  mass  flow  rate  Mox+Mb  is  proportional  to  non-steady-state  burning  rate  ub(t)  of  the 
binder. 

It  should  mean  that  steady-state  models  of  a  relay  race  type,  used  extensively  in  the  case  of  uox>ub, 
are  unsuitable  with  a  quite  high  volume  fraction  q  >  q*  for  the  filler  when  it  may  form  continuous 
solid  chains  in  the  HCS  [135,  136].  For  example,  this  limitation  may  be  applied  to  an  equation 
provided  from  [133]  if  it  is  assumed  that  in  it  qi  =  q*.  Then  u  *  uox  and  combustion  propagates 
along  chains  of  the  filler  in  a  similar  way  to  that  along  binder  layers  in  HCS  with  rapidly  burning 
binder,  and  simple  conclusions  about  nonsteady-state  combustion  can  only  be  made  as  before  for 
rapidly  oscillating  pressure  (tp  «  d/um). 


6-35 


In  the  general  case,  when  times  tp,  d/uox  and  d/ub;  are  comparable,  the  synchronizing  effect  of 
changing  external  conditions  on  local  nonsteady-state  phenomena  around  individual  grains  weak¬ 
ens  as  compared  with  the  case  tp  «  max(d/u0X,  d/ub).  It  requires  consideration  of  the  change  in 
time  tp  of  surface  structure  in  the  region  of  an  individual  grain.  These  attempts  made  in  models  in 
[137,  59,  62],  however,  can  be  considered  only  for  HCS  with  an  ordered  structure.  Nonetheless, 
developed  in  [137,  59,  62]  approach  may  be  useful  if  according  to  [138]  a  highly  loaded  HCS, 
consisting  of  randomly  located  and  orientated  elements  with  correctly  (hexagonal  and  cubic) 
placed  particles  in  these  elements,  is  considered. 

Combustion  under  periodically  oscillating  pressure.  Consider  now  in  more  detail  the  situation 
when  filler  particle  location  in  the  HCS  is  completely  disordered;  particle  dimensions  are  quite 
large  so  that  combustion  of  almost  the  whole  particle  surface  and  almost  the  whole  surface  of  the 
binder  may  be  assumed  to  be  independent  (h  »  h*).  Let  response  functions  exist,  found  theoreti¬ 
cally  or  experimentally,  for  pure  filler  and  binder  in  the  form 

fox((0)  =  (Auox/uOx)/(AP/P),  fb(0))  =  (AUb/ub)/(AP/P),  (6.20) 

for  harmonic  change  in  pressure  AP  =  |AP|  exp(itot).  In  this  way  the  binder  bums  faster  than  the 
filler,  uox  <  ub  (grains  bum  out  in  gas  phase),  but  values  of  tp  ~  2tt/(0,  d /  uox  and  d/ub  are  compara¬ 
ble  so  that  a  change  in  grain  shape  in  the  pressure  pulsation  time  should  be  considered.  In  the 
bulk  of  HCS  a  filler  grain  is  assumed  to  be  spherical  and  identical  everywhere.  It  is  necessary  to 
obtain  in  a  linear  approximation  response  functions  for  mass  velocity  M  for  HCS  specimen  com¬ 
bustion 

fM(co)  =  (AM/M)/(AP/P)  (6.21) 

and  for  combustion  product  temperature 

fRT(to)  =  (ART/RT)/(AP/P)  (6.22) 

In  order  to  find  both  of  these  values  it  is  sufficient  to  know  current  values  of  mass  velocities  of 
gas  formation  for  the  filler  and  binder  at  the  specimen  surface: 

M  =  M0X  +  Mb,  AMM  =  (AM0X/M0X)(M0X/M)  +  (AMbMb)(l-M0X/M)  (6.23) 

The  dependence  of  flame  temperature  on  M0x/M  is  assumed  to  be  known  from  a  test  or  calcula¬ 
tion,  then  taking  account  of  (4)  one  obtains 

fRT(w)={d  In  RT/d(M0X/M)}  A(M0X/M)/(AP/P),  (6.24) 

A(Mox/M)=(MoxMb/M2)  [AM0X/M0X  -  AMb/Mb] 

In  order  to  find  the  variation  of  mass  flow  rates  Mox(t)  and  Mb(t)  it  is  convenient  to  present  them 
in  the  form 

Mb  =  pb  Sb  ub,  (AMb/Mb)/(AP/P)  =  (ASb/Sb)/(AP/P)  +  fb((0);  MoX  =pox  J(-3w/3t)dN 

(6.25) 

Here  w  is  the  as  yet  unbumed  volume  of  filler  particles;  N  is  the  number  of  burning  particles  (also 
including  those  flying  off).  Thus,  with  known  fox(oo),  fox(co)  the  problem  is  reduced  to  geometry, 
i.e.,  to  calculation  of  ASb(t)  and  the  integral  (6.25). 

The  binder  surface  in  contact  with  gas  is  assumed  to  be  plane  and  having  area 

Sb  « (l-q)S  =  const,  ASb(t)  =  0.  (6.26) 

This  assumption  reflects  reality  very  conditionally.  Actually,  the  binder  surface  is  curved  every- 


6-36 


where  (see  in  Fig.  6.12a  evolution  of  the  plane  front  at  first  enveloping  a  single  particle),  and  the 
area  of  it  is  less  than  the  value  (l-c,)S  corresponding  to  a  plane  front.  In  fact,  steady-state  velocity 
u<  Ub  due  to  curvature.  On  the  other  hand,  the  geometric  relationship  uS(l  -  <5)  =  SbUb  is  fulfilled, 
and  whence  with  u  <  ub  it  follows  that  Sb  <  S(1  -  q).  Considering  curvature  the  behavior  of  func¬ 
tion  u/Ub  <  1  versus  q  may  be  obtained  by  experiment  or  theoretically,  for  example,  by  assuming 
the  HCS  consists  of  arbitrarily  orientated  elements  with  a  correct  structure  for  particles.  However, 
it  is  noted  that  for  linear  nonsteady-state  analysis  the  left-hand  pert  of  equality  (6.26)  is  not  so  im¬ 
portant  as  the  right-hand  part,  and  the  latter  is  accurately  fulfilled.  This  follows  from  the  fact  that 
the  leading  combustion  of  the  binder  in  this  arrangement  in  no  way  depends  on  the  nature  of  filler 
bum  out  (the  movement  of  a  curved  binder  combustion  front  is  the  same  as  if  the  filler  was  inert). 
Since  normal  velocity  Ub(t)  is  identical  everywhere,  the  shape  and  area  of  the  local  binder  surface 
elements  depends  only  on  the  thickness  of  the  burning  layer  Jubdt  and  it  does  not  depend  on  how 
velocity  changes  during  its  combustion.  Whence  it  follows  that  for  the  whole  specimen  Sb  does 
not  depend  on  time  with  p  =  p(t). 

Consider  now  the  filler  combustion.  If  with  pressure  variations  there  is  also  variation  of  ratio 
uox/ub,  toward  the  center  of  a  burning  surface  of  each  grains  waves  propagate  of  the  change  in  sur¬ 
face  shape  from  the  contact  line  with  the  binder,  which  serves  as  a  source  of  disturbances.  A 
similar  process  was  considered  in  [139].  The  phenomenon  is  described  by  an  equation  in  first  or¬ 
der  partial  derivatives.  However,  if  it  is  considered  that  actual  particles  have  an  irregular  shape 
and  they  are  in  contact  with  the  disordered  curved  surface  of  the  binder,  then  the  simplification 
introduced  in  the  BDP  model  [140]  is  valid.  It  is  assumed  that  emerging  from  the  HCS  surface  a 
particle  bums  at  its  tip  at  rate  uox(t),  and  the  rest  of  the  surface  in  contact  with  gas  (Fig.  6.12b) 
changes,  remaining  by  part  of  a  sphere  bounded  with  the  plane  surface  of  the  binder  moving  at  a 
rate  of  ub(t).  By  calculating  integral  (6)  with  these  assumptions  for  HCS  with  randomly  distrib¬ 
uted  particles  throughout  the  volume,  it  is  possible  to  obtain  (see  Appendix  6.4.1) 

(AMos/Mox)/(AP/P)  =  fb(C0)+3(fox((0)-fb(C0))8F(£2,5)  (6.27) 

F(a,6)=[l/6+(l-8)2/(35)+i(l-5)2/^+(l-(l-6)45)/Q2+2i6(2-55)/Q3]- 
-  [(l-282)/Q2+2i8(2+38)/£23]  exp(-i£2)  +  (16i82/£23)  exp(-iQ/28)  cos(Q/2),  (6.28) 

8  =  uox/ub,  £2  =  cod/ub. 

It  is  possible  to  show  that  in  (6.28)  with  to— >0,  F(£2,  8)— >0,  so  that  (AMox/MoX)— >  Aut/  ub.  This 
corresponds  to  a  physical  meaning:  With  slow  pressure  variations  the  specimen  bums  in  a  quasi  - 
steady  way  at  a  rate  of  ub(P).  According  to  [11]  with  high  frequencies  there  should  be 
(AMox/Mox)-*Auox/uox,  i.e.,  in  (6.27)  there  should  be  38F(£2,8)— >1.  However,  from  (6.28)  it  fol¬ 
lows  that  F0»,  8)=(l/38)-l/2+8/3,  which  complies  in  fact  only  with  8  =  uox/ub  «  1.  The  reason 
for  the  divergence  is  use  of  a  simplifying  assumption  about  always  spherical  shape  for  the  part  of 
the  particle  projecting  above  the  binder.  According  to  this  assumption  it  is  necessary  that  in  order 
to  retain  a  spherical  shape  the  particle  surface  responses  instantaneously  as  much  as  necessary  to 
rapid  variation  of  the  boundary  with  the  binder,  which  contradicts  the  physical  meaning.  A  more 
accurate  mathematical  statement  without  using  assumptions  for  spherical  shape  leads  to  a  quite 
cumbersome  calculation  algorithm  and  it  is  out  of  place  while  taking  account  of  the  roughness  of 
other  adopted  idealizations.  Instead  of  F  let  we  use  a  "corrected"  function

where  y  is  matching  factor  (probably,  it  is  of  the  order  of  1).  According  to  (6.28),  (6.29),  Fi— >0 
with  Q,— >0;  Fi  — >  1/35  with  By  assuming  Fi  =  F2  +  iF3,  we  have  from  (6.28)  and  (6.29) 

F2=  (l-28)2/(38Q2)  -  (1-282)Q-2  cos  Q  -  28(2+38)Q'3  sin  Q  + 

+  16  82Q'3  sin(Q/25)  cos(Q/2)  -  (3-28)(6yi2)1sin(y^),  (6.30) 

F3  =  (l-8)2/Q  +  28(2-5 8)/Q3  +  (l-282)Q~2  sin  Q  -  28(2+3  S)£T3  cos  Q  + 

+  16  82Q  3  cos(£2/28)  cos(Q/2)  +  (3-28)(6yQ)-1[l-cos(yi2)]. 

Other  forms  of  "corrected"  function  F  are  possible  apart  from  (6.29).  Now  by  substituting  in 
(6.27)  function  Fi  according  to  (6.27)-(6.30),  it  is  possible  to  obtain  from  (l)-(8)  the  fM(o)),fRx(to) 
sought. 

Let  we  discuss  the  form  of  fRT(w).  From  (6.24)-(6.27)  it  follows  that 

fRT=(ART/RT)/ (AP/P)= 

=  [dlnRT/  d(M0X/M)](M0X/M)(  1  -  Mox/M)3[fox((0)-fb(a))]8F1(Q,8)  (6.31) 

Shown  in  Fig.  6.13  are  the  values  of  modulus  A  (ascending  curves)  and  argument  (de¬ 
scending  curves)  for  the  value  38Fi  depending  on  Q.  =  tod/ub  with  different  8  =  u0X/Ub  and  y; 

A  =  38(F22+F23)1/2,  6  =  arctg(F3/F2).  (6.32) 

It  can  be  seen  that  the  dependence  on  the  matching  factor  y  =  0.5-2  is  small,  it  weakens  with  an 
increase  in  the  ratio  1/8  =  Ub/uox,  and  in  any  case  it  does  not  qualitatively  change  the  shape  of 
curves.

Now  it  is  possible  to  draw  some  conclusions  about  the  nature  of  the  relationship  fRx(o))  according 
to  (6.31)  (Fig.  6.14).  It  is  well  known  [20]  that  for  a  homogeneous  composition  with  a  linear 
combustion  rate  u  at  low  frequencies  (to«27ni2/K)  the  response  function  f  =  (Au/u)/  (Ap/p)  is 
close  to  the  index  in  the  burning  law  v  =  dlnu/dlnp,  and  with  co~2ttu2/k  modulus  f  normally  has  a 
maximum  and  then  it  decreases.  Taking  account  of  8  =  uox/Ub  <  1,  the  dependence  of  product 
modulus  (fox  -  fb)38Fi  on  to  may  have  a  zero  slope  "shelf"  starting  at  co/27t  ~  u^d  and  two  maxi- 
mums  at  cd/2tc  ~  u20x/k  and  0)/27t  ~  uVk  (see  Fig.  6.14a).  If  u20x/k  <  Ub/d,  the  "shelf"  and  the 
maximum,  connected  with  the  response  of  the  filler,  degenerate  into  a  maximum  with  ta/2jt  ~  Ub/d 
(see  Fig.  6.14b). 


APPENDIX  6.4.1. 


According  to  (6.25)  in  order  to  obtain  the  relationship  Mox(t)  at  first  it  is  necessary  to  find  the  un- 
bumed  volume  of  grain  partly  emerging  at  the  surface.  We  take  as  origin  x  =  0  at  the  cold  end  of 
the  specimen,  and  at  the  burning  surface  x  =  xs.  At  instant  t  we  consider  the  geometry  of  a  particle 
with  a  center  (without  considering  combustion)  in  plane  x.  The  still  unbumed  particle  consists  of 
two  segments  with  heights  hB  and  hox  with  a  common  base,  i.e.,  a  circle  of  diameter  db  and  with 
total  volume 

w  =  (7thB/6)[3(db/2)2+h2B]  +  (7th0x/6)[3(db/2)2+h2ox].  (D 

We  express  hB  and  hox  in  terms  of  xox  and  Xb,  which  indicate  at  what  distance  at  instant  t  com¬ 
bustion  has  propagated  through  the  particle  (from  the  tip)  and  through  the  binder,  i.e.,  with  ap¬ 
pearance  of  particle  tip  at  the  burning  surface  (see  Fig.  6.12b) 

hB = xb  -  xox,  h0x  =  d  -  xb,  (H) 

We  use  the  geometric  relationship 

(db/2)2  =  xb  (d  -  xb).  1)  (HD 

If  the  center  of  the  particle  (without  considering  combustion)  lies  in  plane  x,  then 

Xb  =  x  — xs  +  d/2,  -  dxs/dt  =  Ub  (IV) 


Particle  combustion  started  with 


xs  =  xs*  =  x  +  d/2  (V) 

and  particle  separated  from  the  surface  with  xs  =  xs**  =  x  -  d/2.

In  a  steady-state  regime  the  left  and  right-hand  parts  of  (XTV)  revert  to  zero.  By  calculating  de¬ 
viation  from  a  steady-state  regime,  referred  to  Ap/p,  for  the  left-hand  part  we  obtain  (AM0X/  Mox)/ 
(Ap/p)  —  fb((0).  In  the  right  hand  side  of  (XIV),  the  expressions  in  square  brackets  in  a  steady- 
state  regime  revert  to  zero,  and  therefore  for  a  linear  approximation  the  rest  of  the  multipliers  be¬ 
neath  the  integral  and  the  limits  of  the  integral  may  be  given  steady-state  values  by  taking  there 
according  to  (IX)  and  (XV)  that 

Sox  =  Sb  S,  Sox**  =  8,  Ss  =  const  -  ubt/d. 

For  disturbance  of  value  8  =  uox(t)/ub(t)  we  obtain

6.4.2.  Possibility  of  synchronization  of  burning  rate  fluctuations  over  the  burning  surface. 

The  possibility  of  synchronizing  the  fluctuations  was  first  mentioned  in  [141].  Fluctuations  in  the 


6-41 


burning  rate  of  localized  parts  of  the  fuel  surface  can  arise,  even  at  constant  pressure,  in  combus¬ 
tion  of  non-homogeneous  compositions  [60]  and  common  quasi-homogeneous  solid  propellants, 
by  the  accumulation  and  periodic  loss  of  the  less  volatile  components  from  the  surface  [142]. 
Randomness,  when  pressure  is  constant,  is  provided  for  commercial  propellants  by  manufacturing 
process  whereas  for  double  base  propellants  some  “disordering”  process  on  the  surface  may  play 
role.  The  transition  from  chaotic  to  organized  structures  occurs  because  of  the  totally  nonlinear 
interaction  is  one  of  the  effects  of  synergy  [143]. 

Let  us  consider  a  composite  solid  propellant  comprising  a  fast-burning  matrix  with  inert  addi¬ 
tions.  The  experimental  data  [128]  shows  that  if  the  matrix  contains  a  catalyst,  then  the  particles 
of  metal  and  even  oxidizing  agents  could  remain  inert  (i.e.  the  rate  of  burning  was  not  influenced 
by  the  nature  of  these  particles,  but  only  by  their  ability  to  extract  heat  from  the  condensed  phase 
of  the  substrate).  Such  a  situation  is  possible  only  if  the  rate  control  stage  is  located  in  the  con¬ 
densed  phase  and  if  it  is  possible  to  neglect  the  solid  phase  chemical  interaction  between  the  ma¬ 
trix  and  the  foreign  particles.  Burning  in  such  a  system  will  spread  along  the  layers  of  matrix  of 
varying  thickness  and  complexity  of  form,  between  the  inert  particles.  Because  of  the  heat  trans¬ 
fer  to  the  particles,  which  is  dependent  on  the  thickness  and  form  of  the  layer,  the  rate  of  burning 
also  varies.  It  is  a  maximum  in  the  pockets  (expansions  of  the  binder  layer)  between  several  par¬ 
ticles.  It  may  be  assumed  that  the  propagation  of  the  flame  will  follow  some  crooked  route  by  the 
widest-  interconnecting  path  between  particles.  Burning  spreads  to  the  narrowest  layers  later, 
without  influencing  the  speed  of  propagation  of  the  flame  along  the  other  paths.  Let  us  neglect  the 
intersection  of  the  separate  paths.  In  other  words,  the  propagation  of  the  flame  along  each  path  is 
independent  of  the  situation  in  the  other  paths.  Further,  assuming  that  the  thickness,  h,  of  a  layer 
along  each  path  is  a  periodic  function  of  its  length,  x,  then: 

h/h0=  l+|Ah/ho|  sin((p+27tx/a).  (6.33) 

Some  justification  for  these  assumptions  follows  from  [135],  where  local  “close  order”  in  highly 
loaded  mixtures,  similar  to  that  in  the  molecular  structure  of  liquids,  was  observed.  Total  order 
does  not  exist  in  real  systems,  and  its  use  in  the  model  leads  to  complete  anisotropy  and  reduces 
the  applicability  of  the  model  (e.g.,  [137]).  In  order  to  avoid  this  problem,  assume  that  identical 
paths  leading  from  the  surface  exist  and  that  disorder  is  introduced:  the  paths  move  haphazardly 
along  normalize  to  the  surface  and  then,  still  randomly,  become  distorted,  (Fig.  6.15).  The  sur¬ 
face  of  such  a  propellant,  under  constant  pressure,  would  bum  at  randomly  fluctuating  local  rates, 
and  the  surface  would  also  be  randomly  distorted. 

Consider  now  the  burning  along  a  single  path.  It  may  be  assumed  that  the  burning  rate  will  de¬ 
pend  on  the  ratio  of  the  burnout  time  of  the  preheated  (without  lateral  heat  transfer)  layer  ti  ~  k  / 
u2  to  the  time  of  transverse  heating  of  a  interlayer  of  thickness  h,  t2  ~  h2/K,  then: 

t2/  ti  =  (uh/K)2,  u/um=  z(t2/  ti).  (6.34) 

where  k  is  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  matrix,  um  is  the  burning  rate  of  solid  propellant  with¬ 
out  particles  (pure  matrix).  The  relation  (6.34)  has  a  stepped  form.  The  upper  value  (u/u0  ~  1  at 
uh/K  >  1)  reflects  the  insignificant  lateral  heat  loss  for  interlayers  which  are  wide  in  comparison 
with  preheated  layer  thickness.  The  lower  value  (u/u0  =  const  <  1  at  uh/K  «  1)  reflects  the  burn¬ 
ing  of  a  solid  propellant  with  finely  dispersed  inert  particles.  According  to  [128,  144],  in  this 
system,  the  action  of  the  inert  particles  can  be  equivalent  to  a  reduction  in  the  initial  temperature. 
T0.  Note  that  the  inert  particles  may  act  in  other  ways,  e.g.,  by  the  absorption  of  the  active  centers 


6-42 


in  the  condensed  phase.  The  opposite  effect  is  also  possible  [131].  To  describe  the  transition  be¬ 
tween  the  extreme  cases,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  multidimensional  [145]  and  unstable  tem¬ 
perature  field  and,  the  effect  of  the  hot  gaseous  phase  on  the  particles,  which  are  protruding  from 
the  surface.  Another  approach  is  to  apply  a  correction  coefficient  to  Eq.(6.34).  For  example,  in 
[128],  the  following  ratio  (for  some  mean  thickness,  h)  was  used: 

z  =  u/um=  1  -  consti  (1  -  exp(-const2/  uh)).  (6.35) 

This  approximation  has  been  used  to  describe  a  wide  range  of  'stationary'  experiments.  The 
analytical  form  (6.35),  derived  in  [128]  was  based  on  physical  considerations,  but  the  acceptance 
of  idealization  raised  rather  more  doubts  than  simple  approximation  based  on  dimensional  analy¬ 
sis.  Since  the  aim  is  only  to  demonstrate  a  possible  mechanism  for  synchronization,  instead  of  Eq. 
(6.35),  the  simpler  expression  can  be  proposed 

u/um  =  exp(-const  /  uh), 

is  adequate  and  is  used  in  the  convenient  form: 

z  =  exp(-B/z),  B  =Bi  (ho/h)  (uo/um).  (6.36) 

If  B  >  B*  =  1/e,  Eq.  (6.36)  gives  only  zero  value  for  z.  If  B  <  B*,  two  additional  solutions  appear, 
of  which  the  greater  has  to  be  taken.  The  burning  law  for  a  pure  matrix  under  variable  pressure 
takes  the  form: 


um  =U0  (p/po)v  =  1  +  |Ap/po|  sin(27tnt). 


(6.37) 


Using  the  relations: 


dx/dt  =  u;  x(0)  =  0,  (6.38) 

we  get  a  closed  system  (6.33),  (6.36)  -  (6.38),  in  which  x  is  the  flame  propagation  path  along  a 
particular  route,  the  uniqueness  of  which  is  set  by  the  initial  lag  O  in  Eq.  (6.36).  Theoretical  re¬ 
sults  are  presented  in  Fig.  6.16,  for  the  dimensionless  size  D  =  uh2  /  u0ho2  with  v  =  0.5,  |Ap/po|  = 
|Ah/ho|  =  0.75,  Bi  =  0.1,  na/uo  =  0.5  for  paths  having  lags  of  <3>  =  0  and  <E>  =  n,  at  the  start  of 
burning.  Calculations  for  any  other  value  of  cp  also  showed  the  complete  synchronization  of  the 
gas  release  on  all  paths  after  some  oscillations.  It  seems  that,  for  the  group  of  parameters  used,  n 
=  u0  /  2a  is  the  natural  frequency  of  the  system.  At  different  of  the  natural  frequencies  of  the  pres¬ 
sure  fluctuations  there  is  no  complete  synchronization  and  the  mean  gas  release  from  the  unit  sur¬ 
face  area  is  taken  as  the  arithmetic  mean  of  the  25  paths  with  lags  of  2x6/25  (0  <  i  <  24).  The  ex¬ 
amples  of  the  fluctuations  are  shown  in  Fig.  6.17.  It  is  seen  that  the  maximum  amplitude  of  the 
total  gas  release  from  the  sample,  based  on  the  used  simplified  model  of  burning,  is  almost  inde¬ 
pendent  of  the  frequency.  Loss  of  synchronization  leads  only  to  a  complicated  relation  between 
the  total  gas  release  and  time. 

Let  us  consider  a  simplified  model  for  the  burning  of  a  solid  propellant  when  a  carbon  skeleton 


6-43 


forms  on  the  surface  and  periodically  collapses.  Assume  that  after  gasification  of  the  volatile 
components  and  up  to  the  next  break-off,  the  skeleton  is  not  deformed.  Then,  the  rate  of  widening 
of  the  layer,  xsk,  of  the  skeleton  is  equal  to  the  linear  rate  of  gasification: 

d  xsk  /  dt  =  u.  (6.39) 


By  analogy  with  [146],  assume  that  the  break-off  occurs  when  and  where  the  local  strength  of  the 
skeleton,  related  to  its  local  temperature  by  the  function  exp(E/RT),  becomes  less  than  the  rupture 
force,  created  by  the  infiltration  of  gases  into  the  skeleton.  Using  Fick’s  law  of  diffusion,  in  the 
form  dp/dx  -  v  ~  mT/p,  then  we  have  for  the  section  0  <  x  <  xsk  the  condition  for  strength  of  ma¬ 
terial:

In  deriving  Eq.  (6.40),  the  small  relative  change  in  p  with  the  thickness  of  the  skeleton  is  ignored. 


6-44 


If  p  =  const,  a  small  heterogeneity  in  the  solid  propellant  means  that  the  next  skeleton  break-off 
do  not  always  occur  simultaneously  over  the  entire  surface.  Close  to  the  boundary  with  the  zone 
in  which  there  is  only  partial  break-off  of  the  layer,  multidimensional  filtration  (Fig.  6.18a)  re¬ 
duces  the  break-away  force.  This  causes  a  delay  in  the  break-off  of  that  part  of  the  zone  (Fig. 
6.18b).  Thus,  the  synchronization  of  the  break-off  can  be  unstable.  However,  it  should  be  re¬ 
membered  that  the  purely  mechanical  bond  of  the  skeleton  along  the  burning  surface  could  lead, 
on  the  contrary,  to  synchronization. 

Consider  further  the  situation  with  a  random  distribution  of  skeleton  zones  on  the  surface,  with 
different  times  of  existence  after  a  break-off.  It  is  seen  from  Fig.  6.18,  that  due  to  the  interaction 
between  zones,  there  can  be  changes  in  the  boundaries  between  the  zones,  during  successive 
break-off  of  the  skeleton.  This  is  almost  independent  of  the  conditions  and  time  of  the  subse¬ 
quent  break-off,  which  will  occur  initially  in  the  center  of  the  zone  under  of  one-dimensional 
strength  condition  (6.40).  Let  us  examine  the  nature  of  burning  along  the  axis  of  one  zone. 

Let  the  solid  propellant  contains  particles  of  catalyst  or  metal,  which  after  gasification  of  the  sur¬ 
rounding  volatile  components  remain  at  a  carbon  skeleton  (such  a  phenomenon  has  been  de¬ 
scribed  in  [147]).  Assume  that  an  exothermic  reaction  occurs,  under  diffusion  conditions,  on  the 
particles  and  that  until  break-off  of  the  skeleton,  the  carry-away  of  agglomerated  particles  from 
skeleton  can  be  ignored.  Then,  the  heat  release  will  have  a  uniform  distribution  along  the  skele¬ 
ton  layer,  with  a  certain  volumetric  density  (cal/cm3s).  If  we  ignore  the  heat  entering  the  skeleton 
layer  from  the  gas  phase,  and  assume  that  this  layer  has  homogeneous  thermal  properties,  then  the 
temperature  distribution  over  the  layer  thickness  will  be  parabolic:

T  =  Tsk(t)-C(t)[xsk(t)-x]2.  (6.41) 


C(t)  is  found  from  the  heat  balance  at  the  boundary  between  the  condensed  phase  and  the  skeleton 
x  =  0,  Xsk  0T  Id  x  =  2Xsk  xskC  =  mc(Ts  -  To  -  Q/c),  (6.42) 

C  =  (Tj  -  To  —  Q/c)  m(t)c/(2Ask  xsk), 

where  Q  is  the  heat  of  gasification.  In  Eqs.  (6.41)  and  (6.42),  it  was  assumed  that  a  quasistation¬ 
ary  thermal  profile  existed  in  the  condensed  phase  and  skeleton,  which  is  true  if  the  pressure 
change  is  sufficiently  small.  Assuming  the  temperature  of  gasification  of  the  volatile  compo¬ 
nents,  Ts,  is  constant,  then  from  Eqs.  (6.41)  and  (6.42): 

Tsk  —  Ts  =  (Ts  —  To  -  Q/c)  me  xsk  /2Ask ,  (6.43)

Furthermore,  assume  b  =  1. 

The  geometric  condition  for  break-off  is  a  tangent  to  the  graph  of  the  right  and  left  hand  parts  of 
Eq.  (6.40),  relative  to  the  coordinate  x.  From  Eqs.  (6.41)-(6.46),  we  get:

A  =  E/RTsk  =  0/(1 +p^  /ds) ,  y  =  l-3y3/[2A(2+y)],  Ci  =  const. 

The  term  Ap/p  in  the  denominator  of  Eq.  (6.47)  indicate  the  relative  change  in  pressure.  The  value 

of  y  is  related  to  T  /  Tsk,  where  T  is  the  temperature  at  the  place  of  rupture.  From  Eq.  (6.41),  the 

intermittent  change  in  the  skeleton  thickness  during  break-off  is  found  using  the  formula: 

x/xsk=  l-[(l-y)(l+fls/p£)]1/2.  (6-48) 

The  theoretical  results  from  Eqs.  (6.46)-(6.48)  are  shown  in  Fig.6.19.  Initially,  with  |Ap/po|  =  0, 
for  the  arbitrary  assumed  initial  values  of  £$  and  po  the  calculations  were  conducted  until  estab¬ 
lishment  of  sustaining  fluctuations  with  period  Ax  =  7.  Then,  for  |Ap/po|  =  0.75,  N  =  1/Ax  =  1/7, 
two  calculations  were  made,  using  the  initial  values  calculated  for  the  case  |Ap/po|  =  0  at  moments 
of  time,  separated  by  approximately  one  half  period.  Synchronization  was  achieved  after  five  pe¬ 
riods.  Fluctuations  caused  by  the  break-off  of  the  skeleton  from  different  zones  of  the  solid  fuel 
surface,  independently  of  heating  as  described  in  the  above  model,  became  coherent  if  the  fre¬ 
quency  of  pressure  fluctuations  coincided  with  the  natural  frequency  (break-off  of  localized  zones 
when  p  =  const).  At  other  pressure  fluctuation  frequencies,  the  surface  processes  were  not  syn¬ 
chronized.

The  relation  between  the  average  time  on  surface  and  the  dimensionless  rate  of  gas  release  is

pendently  burning  local  zones  ,  with  initial  values  \ ,  p  uniformly  distributed  over  the  phase 
fluctuations  (for  p  =  const.)  of  the  local  zone.  In  particular,  for  |Ap/po|  =  0,  the  average  value  of  m 
for  25  zones  varied  with  time  only  in  the  fourth  figure.  It  is  seen  that  in  the  proposed  model,  an 
increase  in  the  frequency  of  pressure  fluctuations  with  |Ap/po|  =  const,  simply  leads  to  a  reduction 
in  |Am/m|,  and  the  transition  through  the  natural  frequency,  associated  with  synchronization  of  the 
different  surface  zones,  does  not  cause  any  characteristic  features  in  the  mean  fluctuations  of  the 
gas  release  rate. 

6.4.3.  Possible  mechanism  of  nonstationary  erosion  combustion 

Only  a  small  part  of  the  studies  on  nonsteady-state  combustion  of  composite  solid  propellants 
(CSP)  has  been  devoted  to  nonsteady-state  erosion  combustion.  In  [148],  for  a  homogeneous  solid 
propellant,  a  function  relating  the  burning  rate  response  to  changes  in  the  cross-flow  velocity  has 
been  obtained.  To  this  end,  a  double  base  propellant  specimen  was  fired  at  the  center  of  a  T- 
chamber  (where  pressure  oscillations  form  a  node,  i.e.,  have  zero  amplitude,  but  flow  velocity 
oscillations  display  bunching,  i.e.,  are  maximal).  It  was  mentioned  [144]  that  the  phenomenologi¬ 
cal  Zel’dovich-Novozhilov  model  holds  for  the  nonsteady-state  erosion  combustion  of  quasi- 
homogeneous  propellants.  In  particular,  it  follows  from  this  model  that  a  propellant  whose  sta¬ 
tionary  burning  rate  is  independent  of  the  cross-flow  of  gases  is  also  insensitive  to  it  in  the  non¬ 
steady-state  combustion  regime.  However,  as  it  was  underlined  in  [149],  the  theoretical  basis  of 
this  phenomenon  is  not  sufficiently  developed. 

No  experimental  studies  on  the  nonsteady-state  erosion  combustion  of  heterogeneous  composi¬ 
tions  are  known  to  the  authors.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  great  need  for  such  investigations  since 
upon  transition  of  CSP  combustion  into  the  nonsteady-state  regime  the  probability  of  erosion  ef- 


6-47 


fects  increases.  Thus,  they  can  arise  in  transient  combustion  of  propellants,  which  did  not  mani¬ 
fest  them  in  stationary  combustion. 

As  follows  from  [150,  151],  for  some  propellants  the  propagation  of  the  leading  edges  corre¬ 
sponding  to  gasification  of  less  thermostable  components  determines  (see,  e.g.,  [128]).the  value 
of  the  stationary  burning  rate  and  can  be  weakly  affected  or  even  unaffected  by  blowing  of  the 
CSP  surface.  However,  the  nonstationary  blowing  is  sure  to  substantially  change  the  gas  genera¬ 
tion  by  the  branched  protruding  surface  of  a  thermostable  component.  Changes  will  also  occur  in 
the  ratio  of  the  gas  phase  components  and  in  the  temperature  of  combustion  products.  This  possi¬ 
bility  is  thought  to  stimulate  the  experimental  and  theoretical  studies  on  the  nonsteady-state  CSP 
erosion  combustion. 

The  magnitude  of  the  effect  (i.e.  the  changes  in  the  gas  phase  component  composition)  depends 
on  the  structure  of  the  protruding  thermostable  component  regions.  When  a  heterogeneous  com¬ 
ponent  is  thermostable  and  there  are  no  processes  keeping  it  on  the  surface,  the  ejected  particles 
bum  out  in  the  combustion  chamber  volume  and  this  is  determined  not  only  by  the  instantaneous 
gas  velocity  near  the  CSP  surface  but  also  by  the  whole  hydrodynamics  of  the  combustion  cham¬ 
ber. 

When  a  thermostable  component  forms  a  sufficiently  strong  framework  on  the  surface,  the  cross- 
flow  effect  depends  on  the  character  of  framework  destruction,  which  can  be  either  a  local  or 
quasi-homogeneous.  In  the  latter  case,  knowing  the  empirical  dependence  of  the  framework  mass 
M  per  1  cm2  of  the  surface  on  the  stationary  flow  velocity  v,  one  can  readily  estimate  the  nonsta¬ 
tionary  addition  to  the  burning  rate  dM/dt  =  (dM/dv)(dv/dt)  (for  details  see  [152]).  Obviously, 
there  are  certain  problems  in  measuring  M.  Experiments  involving  no  surface  cross-flow  have 
been  described  in  [147]. 

If  a  thermostable  component  forms  separate  protrusions,  empirical  data  on  their  size  as  a  function 
of  v  can  be  useful.  In  this  case,  one  also  needs  information  on  changes  in  the  protrusion  form  in 
the  nonsteady-state  regime.  The  information  can  easily  be  obtained  in  particular  by  approximate 
methods  [150, 151]. 

Let  us  describe  a  possible  semiempirical  method  [153]  for  determining  the  response  function  for  a 
propellant  with  thermostable  component  protrusions.  To  this  end,  we  restrict  ourselves  to  the 
simplest  approximation  with  CSP  modeled  by  a  composite  "sandwich"  type  system,  the  flat  cross 
section  of  which  consists  of  alternating  rectangles  of  (lcm-b)  for  nonvolatile,  slow  burning  and  of 
(lcm-a)  for  fast  burning  components. 

Assume  that  in  experiments  with  combustion  gases  flowing  over  the  burning  surface  of  a  model 
laminated  specimen  (across  the  layers)  in  the  steady-state  regime  it  is  found  that  the  linear  burn¬ 
ing  rate  h  is  actually  independent  of  the  flow  velocity  v.  We  have  mentioned  above  the  most 
probable  reason  for  this  phenomenon.  The  burn-out  of  the  less  thermostable  component  in  the 
leading  edges,  which  determines  the  stationary  burning  rate  of  the  whole  system,  is  protected 
from  the  influence  of  combustion  product  flow  by  protrusions  of  the  thermostable  component. 
The  protrusions  are  subjected  to  this  influence  in  all  respects,  i.e.,  as  v  changes,  the  form  and 


6-48 


height  of  the  protrusions  also  change.  It  is  quite  probable  that  intensifying  heat  and  mass  transfer 
causes  a  decrease  in  the  protrusion  height.  Needless  to  say,  at  a  fairly  high  critical  flow  velocity 
the  protrusions  cease  to  play  a  protective  role  and  the  stream  will  influence  the  leading  edges. 
This  range  of  parameters  is  beyond  the  limits  of  our  study. 

Assume  that  the  "stationary"  empirical  v-dependence  of  the  protrusion  height  hst  on  the  surface  is 
known.  In  the  steady-state  regime,  the  propagation  rates  of  protrusions  ui  =  -  dxt  /  dt  and  edges  Uf 
=  -dxf/dt  coincide.  Under  conditions  of  transient  blowing,  the  maximum  gas  velocity  is  believed 
to  be  not  higher  than  the  critical  one.  Hence,  uf  =  const  =  ust  and  for  ui  the  following  relation 
holds: 


hence, 


ui  =  ui,  st  +  A[h  -  hst(v(t))]. 


dh/dt  =  -A[h  -  hst(v(t))].  (6.49) 

Here  -  hst(v)  is  a  "quasi-stationary"  dependence,  e.g., 

hst  =  xi  -  xf  =  h0  -  kv2  (6.50) 

Here  x  is  the  coordinate  of  the  surface  in  the  system  related  to  CSP;  the  indices  st,  1,  f,  0  mean  the 
steady-state,  slow  and  fast  burning  components,  and  the  absence  of  blowing,  respectively.  Note 
that  the  only  data  obtained  by  measuring  the  roughness  of  quenched  specimens  burning  without 
any  blowing  are  presented  in  [91].  The  photo-  and  radiographs  of  CSP-modeling  laminated 
specimens  may  be  useful  for  obtaining  h(v).  The  quadratic  dependence  (6.50)  is  taken  as  the  sim¬ 
plest  one  to  satisfy  the  requirement  for  the  independence  of  the  whole  erosion  combustion  pattern 
from  the  sign  of  the  flow  velocity.  The  meaning  of  (6.49)  is  as  follows.  The  more  the  slow  burn¬ 
ing  component  protrudes  outside  the  quasi  stationary  level,  the  faster  it  bums  out  due  to  the  action 
of  the  cross-flow,  and  vice  versa.  The  constant  A  can  be  determined  from  either  the  "nonstation¬ 
ary"  experiment  or  theory.  Solution  (6.49)  limited  at  t  — ►  -  oo  (more  precisely,  obeying  the  condi¬ 
tion  lim  t  — ►  -  oo  [h  exp(At)]  =  0)  has  the  form 

t 

h(t )  =  A  J hst(v(t))e~A{t~x)dx  (6.51) 


In  particular,  with  sign-alternating  variations  in  the  stream  velocity  (e.g.,  for  the  developed  tan¬ 
gential  gas  flow  oscillations  in  cylindrical  bore  of  the  burning  CSP  charge)  with  frequency  (0, 
when  v  =  va  cos(co  t),  Eqs.  (6.50)  and  (6.51)  give 

h  =  h0  -  kva2  {0.5  +  [0.5 A  cos(2to  t)  +  to  sin(2w  t)]  A/(A2+4co2)}  (6.52) 

The  changes  in  the  ratio  of  the  components  products  of  gasification  in  the  gas  phase  can  be  esti¬ 
mated  with  the  use  of  the  law  of  change  in  the  shape  of  protrusions  with  change  in  their  height 
(e.g.,  similarly  to  [4,  5]).  Assuming  a  triangle  form  of  protrusions,  the  leading  points  of  which  at 


6-49 


the  boundary  with  an  easily  gasified  component  propagate  throughout  CSP  with  a  constant  speed 
Uf  and  the  height  h  can  vary  with  time,  we  obtain  the  mass  flow  rate  of  the  slow  burning  solid 
component  (calculated  for  one  layer): 


M,*  =  pi.b(uf-  0.5  dh/dt)  (6.53) 

The  mass  flow  rate  of  one  layer  of  the  fast  burning  component  is  time-independent  and  amounts 
to  Mf*  =  Pf  auf ,.  Here  pi  and  pf  are  the  component  densities.  Hence,  taking  into  account  (6.52), 
we  obtain

In  (6.54)  the  (pi  b)  /  (pf  a)  =  a/(l  -  a)  relation  is  used,  which  holds  true  for  the  above  composite 
system  where  a  is  the  mass  fraction  of  the  slow  burning  (thermostable)  component  in  the  system. 

Relation  (6.54)  determines  the  variable  composition  of  combustion  products.  For  composite  sys¬ 
tems  (not  necessarily  for  the  sandwich  ones)  consisting  of  the  two  above-mentioned  components, 
when  the  "stationary"  dependence  of  the  temperature  of  the  combustion  products  on  the  composi¬ 
tion  Tp(a)  is  known  from  either  thermodynamic  calculations  or  experiment,  relation  (6.54)  can  be 
used  for  calculating  the  variable  Tp(a(t))  with  a(t)  =  (Mi*  /  Mf*)/(1  +  Mi*  /  Mf*)  for  given  non¬ 
steady-state  regime  of  the  laminated  system. 

Thus,  the  above  analysis  shows  that  a  laminated  system  with  combustion  characteristics  that  are 
almost  insensitive  to  stationary  cross-flow  can  display  nonstationary  effects  under  transient 
blowing.

CONCLUDING  COMMENTS 


The  aim  of  the  mathematical  modeling  of  energetic  materials  combustion  is  prediction  of  the 
combustion  characteristics  under  given  external  conditions  that  provides  opportunity  for  dimin¬ 
ishing  a  number  of  costly  firing  tests  with  different  kind  gas  generators.  In  fact,  at  the  present 
time  combustion  modeling  of  energetic  materials  became  mature  scientific  discipline  starting 
from  pioneer  works  of  Ya.  B.  Zeldovich  performed  in  the  beginning  of  1940’s.  Great  progress 
has  been  achieved  now  in  developing  of  detailed  kinetic  schemes  and  sophisticated  numerical 
methods  for  solving  the  combustion  problems.  However,  the  importance  of  these  novel  ap¬ 
proaches  should  not  be  overestimated  because,  as  it  was  already  mentioned  in  Preface,  simple 
comparison  of  theoretical  and  restricted  experimental  data  does  not  give  enough  evidences  for  the 
validity  of  theoretical  model.  This  idea  was  also  formulated  in  several  works  including  excellent 
paper  by  M.  Miller  [I]  and  published  later  exhaustive  review  by  F.  A.  Williams  [2].  The  latter 
wrote:  ”So  many  phenomena  are  included  in  typical  computational  results  that  agreement  be¬ 
tween  experiment  and  computation  no  longer  explains  experimental  results”  [2]. 

This  means  that  analytical  approaches  and  physically  substantiated  theory  are  needed  for  ex¬ 
plaining  both  experimental  observations  and  computational  results.  At  the  same  time,  to  provide 
background  for  existing  and  newly  developed  combustion  models  there  is  a  great  need  of  devel¬ 
opment  of  novel  research  techniques,  which  may  give  space-  and  time  -  resolved  information 
about  processes  in  the  combustion  wave.  Actually,  to  make  comparison  with  contemporary  theo¬ 
retical  models  one  needs  experimental  data  not  only  on  temperature  profile  and  stationary  burn¬ 
ing  rate  but  also  on  species  distribution  and  transient  burning  rate.  Partially  these  data  became 
available  now  from  the  measurements  in  the  gas  phase  mainly  with  various  spectroscopy  tech¬ 
niques  and  with  recoil  force  and  ultra  sound  techniques.  However,  it  remains  difficult  obtaining 
data  under  high  pressures  and  high  frequency  fluctuations  of  external  conditions. 

At  present  time  most  difficult  technical  task  is  getting  detailed  information  about  processes  in  the 
bulk  and  on  the  surface  of  the  condensed  phase  of  energetic  materials.  Obviously,  the  data  on 
thermal  decomposition  obtained  in  conditions  of  slow  heating  rates  (tens  of  K/min  in  classical 
DTA  methods)  can  not  be  used  directly  in  the  modeling  of  processes  running  in  the  combustion 
waves  (typically  thousands  of  K/s).  More  appropriate  is  use  of  data  derived  from  experiments  on 
ignition  or  high  temperature  pyrolysis  that  simulate  more  closely  the  conditions  of  high  tempera¬ 
ture  and  relatively  thin  preheated  layer  inherent  for  combustion  process. 

Another  problem  is  a  description  of  physical  state  of  a  subsurface  layer  in  burning  energetic  ma¬ 
terial.  It  is  known  fact  that  majority  of  new  effective  oxidizers  like  ADN,  HNF  as  well  as  classi¬ 
cal  AP,  HMX  and  RDX  form  melted  layer  at  the  surface  that  may  lead  to  appearance  of  bubbles 
and  two-phase  flow  of  decomposition  products.  Existing  theoretical  models  [3,4]  are  still  based 
on  arbitrary  assumptions  on  the  origination  and  growth  of  the  bubbles.  Therefore,  reliable  ex¬ 
perimental  observations  are  strongly  needed  for  substantiation  of  such  kind  models.  It  should  be 
also  mentioned  the  lack  of  information  on  behavior  of  typical  and  newly  developed  binders  under 
fast  heating  conditions.  Totally  it  takes  appropriate  efforts  and  resources  in  order  to  develop  ex¬ 
perimental  means  to  measure  parameters  in  the  condensed  phase.  Combination  of  fresh  experi¬ 
mental  results  and  modem  theoretical  approaches  will  allow  formulating  the  comprehensive 
combustion  models  of  energetic  materials  that  meet  demands  of  engineering  design.

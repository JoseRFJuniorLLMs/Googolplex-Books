THE  EFFECT  OF  FLUOROCARBON  SURFACTANT  ADDITIVES  ON  THE  EFFECTIVE 
VISCOSITY  OF  ACETONE  SOLUTIONS  OF  CELLULOSE  DIACETATE 

L.  A.  Shits,  N.  Yu.  Kal'nova  (Institute  of  Physical  Chemistry  of 
the  AS  USSR,  Moscow) 


— : ^The  fact  that  the  viscosity  of  acetone  solutions  of  cellulose 
diacetate  (CDA)  [DATs]  can  be  reduced  by  the  addition  of  small 
quantities  of  water  has  been  known  for  a  long  time'+^jT"  It  is  given 
practical  application  in  the  production  of  acetone  fibe  r'^  An 
analogous  viscosity  reduction  effect  is  achieved  when  water  or  butanol 
(about  3%  by  volume)  is  added  to  acetone  solutions  of  partially 
saponified  polyvinlyl  acetate The  literature  contains  recom¬ 
mendations  on  the  introduction  of  CDA  together  with  aqueous  semi- 
colloidal  surfactants  (PAV)  of  the  alkylbenzol  sulfonate  type  into 
acetone  solutions'-f^Pf'T^ 

"Yn  our  study,  using  Na  salts  of  perf luoroenanthic  (perfluoro- 
gentylol)  acid  we  showed  that  it  was  possible  to  reduce  the  effect 
of  viscosity  in  CDA  solutions  in  acetone  by  introducing  small  quantitie 
of  highly  surface-active  fluorocarbon  substances  ( f luorothenzides ) 
in  the  presence  of  water^  In  the  experiment  CDA  with  a  molecular 
mass  of  about  28,000  was  i^sed.  Viscosity  measurements  (7j)  were  taken 
in  centipoise  using  a  "Rhebtest  RV”  rotation  viscosimeter  at  different 
shear  stresses  (•f*)  in  a  range  of  150-4000  dynes/cm^.  Prior  to 
viscosity  measurement  the  solution  specimens  were  held  in  a  thermostat 
for  two  days.

Curves  Iggilgx)  for  9%  solutions  of  CDA  in  acetone  with  different 
concentrations  of  water  (up  to  8%  of  the  volume  of  the  solvent)  at 
30°C  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  dependence  of  $  on  the  concentration 
of  water  in  the  solvent  is  given  for  x  =  500  dynes/cm^;  this  is  the 
range  of  r  values  in  which  the  viscosity  depends  on  shear  stress  to 
the  least  degree.  The  2  value  minimum  in  the  studied  solutions  falls 
within  a  water  content  of  about  1$. 

Sodium  salt  of  perf luoroenthanic  acid  in  quantities  of  up  to  1$ 
by  weight  of  the  polymer  was  introduced  in  a  dissolved  form  into  9% 
solutions  of  CDA  containing  0.3,  0.9,  and  1.8  %  by  volume  of  water. 

The  change  in  viscosity  of  these  solution  as  a  function  of  the 
f luorothenzide  is  shown  in  Fig.  23  (curves  1,  2  and  3).  Also  shown 
here  is  curve  4  for  a  20^6  solution  of  CDA  containing  about  1%  water. 

In  Fig.  2  viscosity  is  presented  in  relative  units,  i.e.,  values 
e'  are  determined  by  the  ratio  of  the  viscosity  of  the  studied  solu¬ 
tion  to  the  viscosity  of  CDA  of  the  same  concentration  but  without 
the  additives.  When,  instead  of  the  salt  of  perf luoroenthanic  acid,- 
we  used  a  standard  type  of  surfactant  (sodium  dodecylbenzosulfonate , 
sodium  dialkylsulfosuccinate,  polyglycol  esters  of  alky lphenols)  in 
the  same  quantities  and  under  the  same  experimental  conditions,  no 
decrease  in  the  viscosity  of  the  solutions  was  observed,  and,  in  a 
number  of  experiments,  a  pronounced  increase  in  viscosity  was  recorded. 

Thus,  the  effect  of  reducing  viscosity  in  CDA  solutions  under 
the  influence  of  small  concentrations  of  surfactants  (tenths  of  %  in 
relation  to  the  weight  of  the  polymer)  is  observed  only  in  the  case 
of  f luorothenzide .  The  effect  of  the  reduction  in  viscosity  with  a 
concentration  of  the  polymer  depends  on  the  concentration  of  the  non¬ 
solvent  (water)  in  the  solvent  (acetone)  and  passes  through  the  maximum 
where  the  f luorothenzide ,  as  the  agent  which  reduces  viscosity,  is 
most  effective  when  the  concentration  of  water  is  one  which  assures 
a  minimal  2  value  under  conditions  where  surfactants  are  present  in 
the  system.  The  minimum  on  the  curve  representing  viscosity  versus 
the  concentration  of  f luorothenz ide  with  an  increase  in  the  concen¬ 
tration  of  water,  shifts  to  the  range  of  high  thenzide  concentrations. 


As  the  concentration  of  the  polymer  decreases  (with  the  concentration 
of  water  remaining  constant)  the  effect  of  viscosity  reduction  in  CDA 
solutions  under  the  effect  of  fluorothenzide  decreases. 

The  obtained  results  can  be  interpreted  as  follows.  As  the  non¬ 
solvent  in  the  system  is  increased,  the  kinetic  unit  -  one  macromolecule 
or  an  associate  of  the  group  of  macromolecules  -  becomes  more  compact, 
combines  a  smaller  quantity  of  the  dissolving  medium,  and  changes  its 
hydrodynamic  characteristics  toward  a  decrease  in  the  viscosity  of 
the  solution.  At  the  same  time  the  intermolecular  (or  interassociate) 
relationship  increases.  With  an  increase  in  the  concentration  of  the 
nonsolvent  the  first  tendency  approaches  a  certain  limit,  while  the 
second  intensifies,  arriving  at  a  progressive  growth  in  the  structural 
component  of  viscosity.  Thus  arises  the  minimum  on  the  curve  repre¬ 
senting  viscosity  versus  the  concentration  of  water  in  the  solution 
(see  Fig.  1).  When  between  the  structural  elements  of  the  solution 
with  increased  density  ("kinetic  units")  sufficiently  strong  cohesion 
no  longer  exists  (the  concentration  of  water  is  below  1%),  the  intro¬ 
duction  of  fluorothenzide  leads  to  their  screening  and  a  weakening 
of  the  interaction.  This  occurs  because  of  the  low  molar  cohesion  of 
the  fluorocarbon  molecules,  which,  may  be  concentrated  around  structural 
elements  of  increased  density.  With  an  increase  in  the  density  and 
cohesion  strength  of  the  structural  elements  (water  consentration 
above  1$)  the  screening  effect  of  the  fluorothenzide  becomes  less 
effective.

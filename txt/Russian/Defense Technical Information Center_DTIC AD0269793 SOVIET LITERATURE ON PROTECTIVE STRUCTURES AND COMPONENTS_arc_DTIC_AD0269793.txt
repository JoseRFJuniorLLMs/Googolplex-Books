The  first  lot  of  gondola-type  railroad  cars  with  125-ton  capacities  has  been 
assembled  at  the  Uralvagonzavod  [Ural  Railroad-Car  Plant],  Each  car  has  a 
useful  volume  of  138  ms  --  more  than  twice  that  of  cars  in  use  at  present. 

Ural  railroad-car  builders  have  designed  another  large  gondola  car  with  a 
100 -ton  capacity.  The  body  of  this  car  is  constructed  of  an  aluminum  alloy 
which  decreases  car  weight  by  one  and  one-half  tons.

As  of  1  Jan  1960,  the  new  T0CT  9238-69  standard  of  clearances  for 
railroads  with  1524-mm-wide  track  became  effective,  replacing  the  OCT  BKC 
6436  standard,  introduced  in  1934  [1].  The  new  standard  is  tb  be  used  in  the 
building  of  new  railroads  and  second  tracks  for  existing  single-track  lines;  the 
reconstruction  and  electrification  of  existing  railroads;  and  the  building  and 
modernization  of  rolling  stock.  For  all  now  railroads,  railroads  undergoing 
reconstruction,  and  those  scheduled  for  reconstruction,  the  new  T0CT 
establishes  a  common  "track  clearance"  "  C"  (Fig.  1).  This  is  a  contour  show¬ 
ing  the  closest  distances  by  which  any  railroad  construction  or  building  (includ¬ 
ing  bridges  and  tunnels)  must  clear  straight  track.  On  curved  portions  of  track, 
clearances  must  be  increased  to  maintain  the  same  safety  of  passage  as  for  a 
two-axis  car  24  m  long  on  straight  track  under  maximum-speed  conditions. 

The  new  T0CT  also  specifies  maximum  outside  perimeters  of  rolling 
stock.  These  perimeters  are  divided  into  two  groups.  One  group  includes 
perimeters  T  (Fig.  2)  and  1-T  (Fig.  3)  for  rolling  stock  operating  exclusively 
on  Soviet  railroads.  Perimeters  T  and  1-T  accomodate  all  types  of  rolling 
stock  operating  within  the  USSR,  but  1-Tdoes  not  include  rolling  stock  of  sub¬ 
urban  electrified  sections. 

The  second  group  includes  perimeters  0-T,  01-T ,  02-T,and  03-T  for 
rolling  stock  operating  both  within  the  USSR  and,  with  some  limitations,

(Fig.  4)  can  operate  only  on  certain  reconstructed  sections  of  1435-mm  main 
lines  in  countries  which  are  members  of  OSZhD,  the  Organization  for  Rail¬ 
road  Cooperation,  founded  in  1956  and  encompassing  the  12  countries  of  the 
Communist  bloc  (Albania,  Bulgaria,  Hungary,  East  Germany,  Vietnam,  Red 
China,  North  Korea,  Mongolia,  Poland,  Rumania,  the  USSR,  and  Czecho¬ 
slovakia)  [3],  Rolling  stock  with  the  Ol-T  perimeter  (Fig.  5)  can  operate 
on  all  1435-mm  mainlines  of  the  OSZhD  countries.  Rolling  stock  with  the 
02 -T  perimeter  (Fig..  6)  can  operate  on  all  1435-mm  lines  of  the  OSZhD 
countries  and  also  on  the  1435-mm  lines  of  the  railroads  which  were  mem¬ 
bers  of  the  now  abolished  Union  of  Middle  European  Railroads.  Finally, 
rolling-stock  with  the  03-T  perimeter  (Fig.  7)  can  operate  on  all  European 
and  Asian  railroads  with  1435-mm  track. 

In  the  old.  ^0T  BK6435,  two  track  clearances  were  specified  --  the  1-C, 

used  prior  to  1.926,  and  the  2-C(Fig.  8),  which  became  effective  in  1926  [2]. 
This  standard  also  specified  separate  clearances  for  tunnels  --  CT-1 
and  CT-2  .  (The  1  and  2  apparently  have  the  same  meaning  as  they  <^o  in 
designations  for  track  clearances. )

A  tank  for  the  transportation  of  liquefied  gases,  primarily  of  the  hydro¬ 
carbon  type,  has  been  designed  by  the  Institute  of  Giproniigaz.  The  tank  has 
an  ID  of  1600  mm  and  is  7600  mm  long.  Total  capacity  is  14.  6  m®  ,  and  useful 
capacity,  12.  4  m*.  It  is  made  from  14-16 -mm-thick  Ct  3  .  steel  plate  [killed 
commercial-grade  steel  with  0. 14-0.  22 io  carbon]. 

The  tank  has  separate  filling  and  emptying  lines.  For  emptying,  the  tank 
is  equipped  with  a  self-contained  pump  driven  by  an  engine  which  uses  gas  from 
the  tank.  The  tank  is  mounted  on  the  52155  frame  of  the  MA8-200B  truck.

1. )  Utkin,  L.  A.  On  the  study  of  the  seismic  effect  of  powerful  explosions. 

IN:  Akademiya  nauk  SSSR.  UraPskiy  filial.  Gorno-geologicheskiy  institut. 

Podzemnaya  razrabotka  rudnykh  mestorozhdeniy  (Underground  mining). 

Sverdlovsk,  1960,  125-130.  (ITS:  Trudy,  vyp.  54). 

Powerful  blasts  with  explosive  charges  up  to  200  tons  not  only  cause  local 
destruction  of  rock  but  also  considerable  elastic  deformation  of  the  surround¬ 
ing  massif.  Such  elastic  deformation  converts  into  a  certain  amount  of  elastic 
energy  which  propagates  as  seismic  oscillations  into  the  surrounding  area. 

The  subsequent  vibration  of  the  massif  is  determined  by  its  elastic  properties 
and  continues  for  some  time  after  detonation  is  completed.  This  phenomenon 
is  called  the  seismic  effect. 

In  spite  of  the  importance  of  the  seismic  effect,  only  during  the  past  few 
years  has  any  study  of  it  been  undertaken.  The  size  of  the  zone  affected  by 
seismic  effect  depends  on  the  amount  of  explosive  charge,  the  properties  of 
the  medium  in  which  the  seismic  waves  are  propagating,  the  distance  from 
the  explosion  site  to  the  point  of  observation,  and  the  strength  of  the  object 
subjected  to  the  action  of  the  explosion. 

The  amplitude  of  the  massif  displacement  can  serve  as  a  criterion  for 
seismic-effect  evaluation.  Some  authors  (M.  A.  Sadovskiy,  F.  A.  Kirillov, 
and  D.  D.  Barkan),  however,  use  the  velocity  of  rock  vibration  as  a  criterion 
in  evaluating  seismic  effect.  Two  methods  can  be  used  in  determining  the  in¬ 
fluence  of  the  seismic  effect  on  the  stability  of  rock  and  underground  areas. 
Stresses  can  be  determined  from  the  velocity  of  rock  vibration  or  by  direct 
measurement  of  the  pressure  caused  by  powerful  explosions  in  the  objects 
under  study. 

Five  methods  for  the  study  of  the  seismic  effect  of  powerful  explosions 
are  considered: 

1)  Visual  observations.  The  data  of  visual  observations  can  play  an  impor¬ 
tant  role  in  the  study  of  the  stability  of  rock  and  underground  areas  subjected 
to  the  seismic  effect.  According  to  this  method,  brittle  materials  are  placed 
in  the  action  zone  of  the  explosion  (e.  g.  ,  concrete  plate,  as  was  suggested  by 
S.  I.  Popov,  Docent,  Magnitogorsk  Institute  of  Mining  and  Metallurgy).  A 
recess  BOO  x  800  x  40  mm  is  filled  with  concrete  or  other  material  and  after 
each,  or  several,  explosions  the  number  and  the  position  of  cracks  occurring 
are  recorded  as  they  relate  to  the  amount  of  explosive  charge,  the  distance  from 
the  explosion,  etc.  The  results  are  compiled  and  are  used  as  preliminary 


-  8  - 


data  for  the  study  of  seismic  effect. 

2)  The  MMKC  method.  This  method,  developed  by  the  Institute  of  the  PhysicB 
of  the  Earth,  is  based  on  the  measuring  of  seismic  vibrations  caused  by  power¬ 
ful  explosions  by  means  of  multichannel  recording  of  vibrations  of  structures 
and  the  ground  .  According  to  this  method,  the  vibrations  from  seismic  detec¬ 
tors  at  different  locations  are  simultaneously  recorded  by  a  6-  or  12-channel 
oscillograph. 

The  HO- 12  and  nO-14  magnetoelectric  oscillographs  (12  and  14  channels, 
respectively)  serve  for  recording  vibration  of  the  ground  caused  by  explosions. 
The  oscillographs  are  supplied  with  24-v  dr-c  power  from  a  50  ampere-hours 
lead-acid  battery.  According  to  data  of  the  Institute  of  the  Physics  of  the 
Earth,  the  recording  speed  of  150-250  mm/sec  is  the  optimal  speed  for  the  os¬ 
cillograph  band. 

Electrodynamic  seismic  detectors  (vibrographs)  are  used  for  recording 
displacements  of  the  massif.  Seismographs  of  the  CnU-16  type  are  used 
primarily  for  recording  vibrations  of  structures  subjected  to  action  from  out¬ 
side  sources.  The  vibrographs  are  based  on  conversion  of  mechanical  motion 
(vibration)  into  electromotive  force.  They  can  record  both  vertical  and  hori¬ 
zontal  components  of  vibration. 

3)  Wire-gage  method.  The  third  method  is  based  on  strain- sensitive  wire 
gages  widely  used  in  the  machine  industry.  Since  the  modulus  of  elasticity  of 
rock  is  lower  than  that  of  steel,  it  is  considered  that  this  method  can  be  suc¬ 
cessfully  used  for  the  study  of  the  state  of  stress  in  rock,  particularly  in  dy¬ 
namic  processes  occurring  rapidly.  The  method  is  especially  advantageous 
in  that  it  permits  the  direct  measurement  of  stresses  caused  by  an  explosion 
as  well  as  the  measurement  of  residual  deformations. 

4)  Piezoelectric  method.  This  method  is  based  on  the  piezoelectric  effect. 
Crystals  of  Rochelle  salt,  tourmaline,  quartz,  ammonium  phosphate,  barium 
titanate,  and  others  can  be  used.  For  this  method  the  author  recommends 
the  establishment  of  technical  specifications  and  the  development  of  piezo¬ 
electric  pickups,  mainly  from  barium  titanate,  according  to  these  specifica¬ 
tions. 

5)  Ultrasonic  method.  This  method  can  be  used  for  the  study  of  rock  disturb¬ 
ances  by  measuring  the  velocity  of  ultrasound  propagation.  Modern  ultrasonic 
instruments  make  it  possible  to  test  rock  at  a  depth  of  2-3  m  and  more. 

For  the  processing  of  experimental  data  in  the  determination  of  seismic 
effect, the  following  equations  are  given  for  the  sinusoidal  vibration:

izdat,  I960,  85  p. 


Methods  of  rock  drilling  experimented  with  in  the  Soviet  mining  industry 
include  the  electrohydraulic  method,  thermal  methods,  and  a  number  of  elec 
trophysical  methods. 


Electrohydraulic  Method 


With  this  method  rock  is  fractured  by  a  pressure  wave  created  by  a  high- 
voltage  discharge  in  a  water-filled  blasthole.  In  1957-1959  a  series  of  produc¬ 
tion-scale  experiments  was  conducted  to  determine  the  feasibility  and  effi¬ 
ciency  of  electrohydraulic  drilling.  The  results  indicated  that  the  method  is 
practical  only  for  fragmentation  of  large  pieces  of  rock  into  smaller  ones. 

For  rock  cutting  and  drilling,  the  electrohydraulic  method  was  found  to  be  non¬ 
competitive  with  conventional  methods,  [pp.  32-45) 


Thermal  Methods 


Soviet  study  of  thermal  methods  of  rock  drilling  and  the  development  of 
flame-jet  cutters  began  in  1950.  Research  is  presently  being  conducted  at  the 
Moscow  Mining  Institute,  the  Kazakh  Mining  and  Metallurgical  Institute,  the 
Moscow  Higher  Technical  School  imeni  Bauman,  Giprorudmash,  and  other 
organizations. 

In  the  development  of  the  burners  Soviet  specialists  concentrated  mainly 
on  the  rotary  multinozzle  type  (See  illustration..  )  In  1958  Giprorudmash  built 
the  first  experimental  unit  and  field  tested  it  the  following  year.  At  the  most 
effective  rotation  rate,  drilling  rates  up  to  9.  6-10  m/hr  were  achieved  in 
secondary  quartzites  with  Protod'yakonov  strength  factor  f  =  10-12.  The 
presence  of  water  does  not  lower  the  drilling  rate  but  the  inclusion  of  soft  or 
caolinized  rock  lowers  it  appreciably  (30-50%).  Similar  results  were  obtained 


-  11  - 


with  manual,  single-nozzle  burners. 

The  following  is  a  general  summary  of  the 
results  of  laboratory  studies  and  field  tests 
on  thermal  drilling  methods: 

1)  The  character  of  the  process  of  rock 
destruction  by  flame  jet  is  determined  not 
by  the  temperature  but  by  the  temperature 
gradient,  which  in  turn  depends  on  the  min¬ 
eral  composition  of  the  rock,  the  nature  of 
ore  inclusions,  the  body  structure  of  the  rock, 
and  the  parameters  of  the  flame  jet.  Struc¬ 
tural  transformations  such  as  occur  in  quartz 
increase  the  effect  of  the  temperature  gradient. 

2)  In  some  types  of  oxidized  and  nonoxidized 
ores  found  in  large  monolithic  formations,  bore¬ 
holes  are  produced  by  destruction  of  the  rock 
without  melting.  In  this  case,  the  maximum 
drilling  rate  Is  achieved. 

3)  Inclusions  of  chlorite-- biotit e  shale  and 
nonuniform  ore  inclusions  contribute  to  full  or 
partial  melting  of  the  rock  and  lower  efficiency 
of  flame-jet  drilling. 

4)  In  a  distrubed  rock  formation,  the  borehole 
formation  is  accompanied  by  partial  melting  of 
the  rock  and  50-60%  reduction  of  the  drilling 

rate  compared  to  that  obtained  in  monolithic  rock,  The  nature  of  the  rock- 
destruction  process  can  be  changed  with  the  use  of  multiple-nozzle  burners 
with  variable  rates  of  nozzle  rotation,  f  pp.  49-54] 

Electrophysical  Methods 

Research  work  on  destruction  and  weakening  of  rock  by  heating  with  high- 
frequency  current  has  been  conducted  since  1949  at  the  Allr Union  Scientific 
Research  Institute  for  Coal  (VUGI)  and  at  the  Mining  Institute,  Academy  of 
Sciences  USSR,  Destruction  of  rock  by  induction  heating  and  by  means  of 
electrical-pulse  discharge  has  been  studied  at  the  Dnepropetrovsk  Mining  In¬ 
stitute  as  well  as  at  VUGI.  ; 

A  mining  machine  designed  at  VUGI  has  a  combination  device  which  breaks 
or  weakens  the  rock  by  means  of  a  high-frequency  electric  field  and  provides 
mechanical  removal  of  rock  and  finishing  of  the  shaft  walls.  The  productivity 
of  the  machine  in  cutting  a  shaft  with  an  8-10-m8  cross  section  is  1.  5-2.  0  m/hr 
through  hard  rock.

Rock  destruction  by  means  of  a  high-frequency  magnetic  field  was  found 
to  be  less  efficient  than  the  method  just  presented.  Experiments  were  also 
conducted  on  rock  destruction  by  direct  application  of  electric  current.  Find¬ 
ings  indicate  that  although  high-voltage  electrical-pulse  discharge  can  be 
used  for  secondary  fracturing  of  porous  rock,  it  is  ineffective  against  strong 
rock.  A  high-frequency  electrical- contact  method  is  more  promising  and 
simpler. 

With  the  electrical -contact  method,  a  high-frequency  electric  current  is 
passed  through  rock,  heating  the  rock  under  the  electrodes  and  producing  a 
current-conducting  channel  between  them.  Rapid,  intense  heating  of  the  rock 
follows  formation  of  the  channel  and  sets  up  thermoelastic  stresses  sufficient 
for  rock  breaking.  The  method  can  be  used  for  breaking  any  strong  rock. 

In  the  summer  of  1659  field  tests  were  conducted  on  the  first  experimental 
mobile  unit  employing  the  contact  method.  The  unit  was  built  at  the  Dnepro¬ 
petrovsk  Mining  Institute.  Iron  ore  blocks  weighing  from  200  to  14, 000  kg  were 
broken  in  30-180  sec.  The  power  consumption  was  1-3  kw-hr /ton,  initial  vol¬ 
tage  was  1000  v,  current  was  50  amp,  and  frequency  was  50-70  kc. 

According  to  Soviet  scientists,  the  electriqal- contact  method  of  rock 
breaking  is  suitable  for  secondary  rock  fragmentation.  The  application  to 
primary  rock  breaking  in  large  underground  excavations  requires  further 
theoretical  and  experimental  research,  [pp.  60-79]

concrete  structures.  Beton  i  zhelezobeton,.  no.  3,  Mar  1961,  111-118. 

TA680.  B38  1961. 

In  the  1960  Exposition  of  the  Achievements  of  the  National  Economy, the 
"Construction"  section  put  on  display  80  instruments  for  investigation  and 
control  of  quality  of  concrete  and  reinforced  concrete.  These  instruments 
were  developed  and  manufactured  by  30  different  organizations.  According  to 
principle  of  operation, they  were  classed  as  pulse,  tuned,  impact,  radiometric, 
and  mechanical. 

Among  the  instruments  exhibited, there  were  six  different  types  of  ultra¬ 
sonic  testers,  all  based  on  the  lot-produced  MKXt-6  .  They  are  considered 
better  than  other  Soviet  and  non-Soviet  models.  Lot  production  for  one  of  the 
six,  the  MKJI-6-B  ,  was  suggested.  This  is  an  ultrasonic  tester  for  mea¬ 
suring  the  time  of  passage  of  an  ultrasonic  pulse  through  concrete,  rock, 
structural  materials,  ice,  or  frozen  ground  to  determine  quality  and  strength. 
The  thickness  of  concrete  which  can  be  tested' ranges  from  2  cm  to  15  m. 
The  error  in  time  measurement  can  vary  within  0.  2  to  2  microsec. 

Designed  for  automatic  inspection  of  road  and  airport  pavement  and  other 
constructions  made  of  concrete  or  other  materials,  the  MK-1  (I1MK-6) 
device  measures  and  records  differences  in  impact-wave  signals  in  the  struc¬ 
ture  being  tested.  The  number  of  shocks  against  the  structure  is  varied  from 
1  to  100  sec. 

A  radioactive  densimeter  for  measuring  unit  weight  of  freshly  compacted 
concrete  within  2  to  4.  5  t/m8  is  used  in  the  construction  of  hydroelectric  and 
nuclear  power  plants.  In  the  latter.it  measures  the  density  of  concrete  to  be 
used  for  biological  protection.  This  device  is  based  on  the  principle  of  the 
absorption  of  radioactive  emission  by  concrete.  Measurement  accuracy  is 
1.  5-2%;  the  time  required  for  one  measurement  is  30-40  sec.  Another  device 
for  the  same  purpose  is  a  radioactive  probe,  which  can  measure  the  density 
of  rock  and  concrete  as  well  as  filtration  flow  in  the  mass  of  earth  and  con¬ 
crete  structures. 

Several  instruments  for  measuring  parameters  of  reinforcing  bars  should 
also  be  noted.  The  II H  device  measures  stresses  in  prestressed  reinforcing 
bars  and  is  particularly  important  in  electrothermal  stretching  of  reinforcing 
bars.  The  KPK-1  vibration-frequency  meter  measures  frequencies  (and 
hence  stresses)  in  reinforcing  bars.  The  IJHMJI  £-1,  ,flK“3  >  AC-50, 
and  3frl  all  measure  stresses  in  reinforcing  bars.

The  BI1-1  electronic  hygrometer  is  used  for  measuring  moisture  content 
in  sand  used  in  the  preparation  of  concrete  mixtures.  The  device  mea¬ 

sures  specific  surface  area  of  cements  and  other  powder  materials  and  is 
based  on  the  principle  of  determining  air  permeability  at  low  air  pressure 
(less  than  1  mm  Hg).  Another  device  measures  air  content  in  concrete  mixes 
and  can  be  used  under  laboratory  conditions  and  in  industrial  inspection. 

Other  instruments  at  the  Exposition  included  a  vibratory  viscosity  meter 
based  on  the  immersion  of  a  hollow  ball  in  a  mixture  subjected  to  vibration,  a 
universal  testing  installation  for  bending  and  torsion  tests  of  concrete  under 
laboratory  and  industrial  conditions,  and  an  electrodynamic  deflection  meter 
for  measuring  deflections  of  structural  elements  under  static  or  dynamic  loads.

In  1958  the  Promstal’konstruktsiya  Design  Institute  completed  the  design 
of  the  first  erection  tower  crane,  the  BK-1425<  Bee  illustration),  with  a  75-ton 
lifting  capacity.  The  crane  was  built  at  the  Ramenskoye  and  Orsk  plants  of 
the  Ministry  of  Construction  RSFSR  and  tested  in  March  1959.  It  was  effective¬ 
ly  used  on  the  construction  of  a  blast  furnace  of  the  Nizhniy  Tagil  Metallurgical 
Combine. 

The  BK-1425  has  the  following  characteristics:

The  three  tunneling  machines  used  in  building  the  Leningrad,  Moscow, 
and  Kiyev  subway  tunnels  are  adaptations  of  the  conventional  shield  and  are 
similar  in  design  and  function.  They  differ  only  in  the  design  of  the  cutter 
heads,  reflecting  the  differences  in  rock  properties  in  the  three  localities. 
The  Moscow  rock  was  medium- strength,  the  Leningrad  rock  was  soft,  and 
that  of  Kiyev  was  a  moist  clay. 


The  Moscow  Machine 

The  machine  used  in  Moscow  (Fig.  1)  was  built  for  tunneling  in  solid  rock 
with  compression  strength  up  to  400  kg/cma.  It  consists  of  shield  8  with  pro¬ 
pelling  hydraulic  jacks,  fixed  bottom  plate  6  with  hydraulic  feeding  jack  3,

for  the  cutter  heads,  bucket  ring  4,  and  scraper  conveyor

Fig.  1.  Mechanized  shield  for  tunneling  in 
medium- strength  rock 


The  cutter  heads  1  (Fig.  2),  each  equipped  with  12  drag-type  bits,  are 
driven  by  two  55-kw  motors  4  (Fig.  2)  through  reducing  gear  trains  J  and  2, 
carrier  $  and  planetary  gear  system  with  stationary  sun  gear  6  and  satellite 
gears  P ,  each  mounted  on  the  same  shaft  as  its  cutter  head.  In  operation  the 
carrier  rolls  the  satellite  gears  around  the  sun  gear,  and  both  cutter  heads 
rotate  around  their  axis  and  simultaneously  around  the  axis  of  the  sun  gear, 
jvith  each  bit  cutting  an  epicycloid- shaped  groove  in  the  rock  (Fig.  3).  Rock 
particles  fall  into  the  buckets  and  from  the  buckets  into  the  scraper  conveyor, 
which  carries  them  to  trucks  in  the  rear  of  the  machine. 

The  feeding  jack  pushes  the  upper  plate  and  the  cutter  heads  forward  at  a 
rate  of  up  to  10-12  mm/min.  The  length  of  the  working  stroke  is  570  mm.  At 
the  end  of  the  working  stroke,  the  upper  plate  with  the  cutter  heads  is  pulled 
back  into  the  initial  position,  the  whole  shield  is  pushed  forward  until  the 
cutter  heads  come  into  contact  with  the  rock  front,  and  the  whole  cycle  is 
repeated. 

After  some  design  corrections  and  the  elimination  of  certain  initial  diffi¬ 
culties, the  Moscow  machine  was  making  tunnel  6.  27  m  in  diameter  at  a  rate 
of  200  m  per  month  (25  working  days,  3  shifts  per  day).  The  average  com¬ 
pression  strength  of  the  rock  was  128  kg/cms  .  Power  consumption  varied 
from  108  to  196  kw-hr/m  of  tunnel  length,  depending  on  rock  strength,  bit 
sharpness  (  BK-8  carbide),  and  feed  rate.  Hard  alloy  consumption  was

The  Leningrad  Machine 

The  machine  used  in  Leningrad  was  built  for  rock  with  compression 
strength  of  40-80  kg/mm*  .  It  has  six  cutter  heads  --  four  outside  heads  with 
18  bits  each  and  two  inside  heads  with  13  bits  each  (Fig.  4).  The  cutter  heads 
are  dHven  by  a  single  100-kw  motor  through  reducing  trains,  carrier,  and 
planetary  gear  system  made  up  of  a  rotating  sun  gear  which  meshes  directly 
with  the  satellite  gears  of  the  two  inside  cutter  heads  and  through  idler  gears 
with  the  satellite  gears  of  the  four  outside  cutter  heads  (Fig.  5). 

In  operation  all  the  cutter  heads  are  rotated  around  their  own  axes  by  the 
sun  gear  and  rolled  around  the  sun  gear  by  the  carrier.  Otherwise,  the  Lenin¬ 
grad  machine  operates  in  the  same  manner  as  the  Moscow  machine.  The 
length  of  the  working  stroke  of  the  feeding  Jack  is  575  mm,  the  rate  of  feed 
is  13-16  mm/min,  and  the  tunnel  diameter  can  be  5.  63-5.  66  m.  One  working 
cycle  is  43-50  min.  Output  per  shift  is  3-4  m;  output  per  month  is  up  to 
228  m.  Power  consumption  is  3-4  kw-hr/m*  .

The  Kljrev  Machine 


The  machine  used  in  the  Kiyev  tunnel  has  only  one  cutter  head  (Fig.  6) 
with  four  radially  arranged  drag-type  cutters  projecting  15-20  mm  through 
windows  4,  5 ,  6 ,  7*  Located  on  the  periphery  of  the  cutter  head  is  a  cutoff 
bit,  which  maintains  the  correct  shape  and  size  of  the  tunnel.  Another  bit 
located  on  the  periphery  is  used  to  increase  the  tunnel  diameter  at  curves.

This  machine  cut  a  1400 -m  tunnel  in  clay  with  a  compression  strength 
of  10  kg/cm*  at  an  average  rate  of  1.  7  m  per  shift,  5  m  per  three-shift  day, 
and  117  m  per  month.  Actual  cutting  time  was  only  22-34%  of  the  working 
cycle,  and  with  some  improvements  and  better  organization  could  be  in¬ 
creased  to  67%.  The  ppwer  consumption  varied  from  20  to  130  kw-hr/m  of 
tunnel  length  and  depended  mainly  on  the  feed  rate. 


None  of  the  three  machines  has  any  gripping  devices  to  take  up  the 
torque  reaction  of  the  cutter  heads;  only  the  dead  weight  of  the  unit  itself 
serves  this  purpose.  This  dead  weight  is  not  always  sufficient,  and  torque 
reaction  can  sometimes  turn  the  whole  unit  in  the  direction  opposite  to  the 
rotation  of  the  cutter  heads.  To  bring  the  unit  back  to  its  correct  position,  the 
rotation  of  the  cutter  heads  is  reversed.

The  analyzer  consists  of  a  sharply  tuned  quartz  filter,  an  electron 
amplifier,  and  a  loop  oscillograph.  To  improve  accuracy  and  speed  of 
operation  a  multivibrator  and  an  electron  tube  for  generating  rectangular 
pulses  are  used. 

The  multivibrator  is  the  delayed- response  type  and  is  triggered  by  the 
trailing  edge  of  the  pulse  being  analyzed.  It  generates  rectangular  pulses  and 
blocks  the  amplifier  tube  for  the  period  of  forced  vibration  of  the  filter. 

The  rectangular  pulses  generated  by  the  electron  tube  are  of  negative 
polarity  and  create  pulse-controlled  negative  feedback  in  the  filter  circuit 
before  the  passage  of  the  next  pulse  to  be  analyzed.

There  are  two  variations  of  the  device.  In  the  first,  testing  is  conducted 
by  feeding  oscillations  simulating  explosions  into  the  input  of  the  amplifier. 
The  operation  makes  use  of  a  photoreproduction  unit,  a  programming  device, 
and  a  reproduction  amplifier.  In  order  to  increase  the  range  of  simulated 
oscillations  and  to  obtain  proper  sequence  of  pulses,  a  multicontact  step 
switch  is  employed.  The  switch  is  made  in  the  shape  of  a  disk  which  carries 
contacts  around  its  circumference.  Resistors  are  connected  to  the  contacts, 
and  the  cursor  of  the  disk  is  joined  to  the  axle  of  a  drum  of  the  photorepro¬ 
duction  unit. 

The  second  variation  is  similar  to  the  first  but  has  a  sound  generator 
substituted  for  the  photoreproduction  unit  and  uses  punched-tape  program 
control.  The  tjape  is  placed  on  the  revolving  drum  carrying  a  pair  of  sliding

Fresh  liquid  hydrogen  usually  consists  of  approximately  75%  ortho  - 
hydrogen  and  25%  parahydrogen,  a  composition  which  corresponds  to  the 
equilibrium  state  for  temperatures  above  300®  K.  Such  a  composition, 
however,  slowly  changes:  orthohydrogen  is  transformed  into  parahydrogen. 
The  transformation  reaction  is  exothermic,  and  the  amount  of  heat  it  pro¬ 
duces,  253  cal/mol,  exceeds  the  heat  of  vaporization  of  liquid  hydrogen,  which 
is  228  cal/mol,  at  normal  pressure.  The.  resultant  evaporation  is  responsible 
for  significant  losses  of  liquid  hydrogen  during  storage  --  18%  in  the  first 
24  hours,  40%  in  the  first  four  days. 

Storage  losses  can  be  avoided  by  converting  all  of  a  given  volume  of 
liquid  hydrogen  into  the  para-modification, which  can  be  stored  for  months 
without  heavy  losses.  At  a  parahydrogen  content  of  95-98%  losses  after  two 
months  amount  to  only  10%, 

Conversion  is  usually  brought  about  during  the  liquefaction  process  in 
a  reactor  directly  connected  into  the  liquefaction  system.  The  temperature 
in  the  reactor  is  21-24®  K.  To  accelerate  the  conversion  reaction  chromium- 
nickel  and  Fe(OH)3,  Cr(OH)s,  and  Mn(OH)4  hydroxide  catalysts  are  used, 
Several  methods  of  connecting  the  conversion  reactor  into  a  liquefaction  sys¬ 
tem  are  used,  depending  primarily  on  the  capacity  of  the  system. 


1  -  heat  exchanger;  2  -  reactor;  3  -  cooling  coils;  4  -  collector  for  ordinary 
hydrogen;  5  -  intermediate  collector;  6  -  parahydrogen  valve;  7  -  valve  for 
ordinary  hydrogen;  8,  9  -  throttling  valves;  10  -  throttling  capillary;  11  -  he¬ 
lium  valve.  nHs  -  ordinary  hydrogen;  pHp-  parahydrogen.

Method  a  (see  illustration)  is  recommended  primarily  for  adaptation  to 
existing  liquefying  plants.  After  leaving  heat  exchanger  l,the  flow  of  high-pressure 
hydrogen  is  divided  into  two  streams.  One  stream  passes  through  the  conven¬ 
tional  liquefying  cycle,  beginning  with  throttling  valve  8 ;  the  ordinary  liquid 
hydrogen  is  collected  in  collector  4  and  removed  through  valve  ?  .  The  other 
stream  passes  through  throttling  valve  9  ,  is  completely  liquefied  in  the  first 
cooling  coil  3  (cooled  with  the  ordinary  hydrogen),  and  enters  conversion 
reactor  2  ,  where  the  orthohydrogen  is  converted  into  parahydrogen.  The 
heat  evolving  from  the  conversion  reaction  raises  the  temperature  of  liquid 
parahydrogen  by  3-4®  K,  causing  part  of  it  to  vaporize.  The  parahydrogen 
is,thereforq  passed  through  a  second  cooling  coil  3  and  from  there  through 
throttling  capillary  V  into  collector  5  ,  from  which  it  is  filled  into  Dewar 
containers  for  storage. 

One  disadvantage  of  this  method  is  the  overheating  of  the  hydrogen  in 
the  conversion  reactor,  which  lowers  the  parahydrogen  concentration  to 
92-03%. 

Method  b  is  suitable  for  medium- size  liquefaction  systems  with  capaci¬ 
ties  of  100-300  l/hr*?or  systems  working  with  a  refrigeration  cycle.  Here,  all 
of  the  hydrogen  from  heat  exchanger /goes  through  throttling  valve  8  into  collec¬ 
tor  5,  in  which  helium  valve  11  maintains  a  pressure  of  1.  8-3.  0  atm.  Part 
of  the  liquefied  hydrogen  passes  through  valve  11  into  collector  4  ,  where  the 
pressure  is  below  0.  5  atm.  Vapors  follow  the  same  route  and  are  directed 
into  the  counterflow  of  heat  exchanger.  1  .  Another  part  of  the  liquefied  hy¬ 
drogen  from  collector  5  goes  into  conversion  reactor  2 ,  which  is  completely 
submerged  in  liquid  hydrogen  of  ordinary  composition.  This  provides  for  an 
extensive  cooling  and  absorption  of  reaction  heat  and  increases  the  concentra¬ 
tion  of  parahydrogen  in  the  final  product  to  99.  7%. 

In  method  c  the  parahydrogen  cycle  has  a  separate  supply  line;  the  hy¬ 
drogen  of  ordinary  composition  serves  only  as  a  coolant  and  circulates  in  a 
closed  circuit.  The  conversion  system  includes  two  cooling  coils  3  --  one 
in  front  of  and  one  behind  the  reactor  --  and  reactor  2  . 

Method  o  is  especially  effective  if  the  hydrogen  for  conversion  is  fed 
through  absorbers  (purifiers)  containing  activated  charcoal  which  are  cooled 
with  liquid  nitrogen.  Since  activated  charcoal  is  also  a  catalyst,  partial  con¬ 
version  occurs  in  the  absorbers.  By  connecting  an  additional  reactor  cooled 
with  liquid  nitrogen  into  the  system  the  parahydrogen  content  can  be  raised 
to  25-49%  prior  to  the  entrance  of  the  conversion  hydrogen  into  the  main 
reactor.  Method  c  is  especially  suitable  for  large  liquefiers  in  which  heat 
exchangers  are  built  as  separate  units. 

With  all  three  methods  maintenance  of  the  lowest  possible  temperature 
in  the  conversion  reactor  is  one  of  the  essential  conditions  for  successful  op¬ 
eration.  Productivity  of  a  reactor  is  determined  by  the  refrigerating  capacity 

of  the  liquefying  system  and  varies  from  30  to  120  g/hr  per  cm8of  the  reactor 
cross  section.

Tank  for  storing  liquid  oxygen 

1  -  container;  2  -  housing;  3,4  -  pipes;  5  -  valve;  6  -  gasifier; 
7  -  pipe  for  lowering  pressure  in  tank;  8  -  discharge  valve  for 
oxygen;  6  -  hatch. 


These  stationary  tanks  for  the  storage  of  liquid  oxygen  are  double-wall 
containers  and  consist  of  spherical  thin-wall  copper  container  1  and  housing  2 , 
surrounding  and  supporting  container.  1,  The  space  between  1  and  2  is 
filled  with  an  insulating  material  such  as  magnesia  powder.  Pipe  3  continu¬ 
ously  feeds  some  of  the  oxygen  being  evaporated  into  the  interwall  space  to 
prevent  absorption  of  moisture  by  the  insulating  material. 

The  container  is  filled  with  liquid  oxygen  through  pipe  4  ,  Valve  8 
serves  for  emptying  the  tank  but  can  also  be  used  for  filling  it  instead  of  pipe 4. 
During  emptying,  a  certain  amount  of  liquid  oxygen  is  led  through  valve  jT  to 
gasifier  8  and  from  there  through  pipe  ?  back  to  container  1  .  The  pressure 
of  this  gaseous  oxygen  forces  the  liquid  oxygen  out  of  1  through  valve  8  .

Tanks  of  similar  design  mounted  on  trucks  serve  for  the  transport  of 
liquid  oxygen.  The  capacity  of  such  a  tank  truck  is  1300  kg  and  corresponds 
to  about  1  ma  of  useful  volume  of  the  tank.  About  30-40  min  are  required 
to  empty  the  tank  at  a  pressure  in  the  tank  of  0.  5-0.  6  atm.
